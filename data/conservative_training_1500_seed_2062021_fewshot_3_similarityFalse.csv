11,"First, in closing thank you to my opponent! I enjoyed this exchange, and I greatly admire the intellect my opponent has displayed during the discourse of this debate. History, Legality, and US Foreign Policy: Rwanda: I know the debate isn't about this specifically, however, I must reply, having read Romeo Dallaire's Shake Hands with the Devil this Canadian General showed evidence and his own testimony that the forces in Rwanda even knew about the genocides were going to happen before they actually did and still refused to do anything, and the only forces to enter were Belgium, and Sudan soldiers dawning the UN Barrets. Dallaire was told to stand down, even when he knew where the arms caches to committ the genocides were and even varified. The UN prevented him from doing anything. Secondly, as I noted earlier my opponent cites the failures or inconsistencies of US foreign policy during the course of this debate. As I noted earlier this is irrelevant, he makes an appeal to hypocracy when doing so. The problem with places such as Guatamala, for instance, or indigenous removal during the US presidency of Andrew Jackson, or the Iran-Contra affairs is the context in which they take place to justify their legitimacy or not. For instance, the native removal lacked UN body existing at that time to set up a framework of legality or not. Whereas today we do, and we're only talking about Iraq under Bush Jr. Not any other time of war. Furthermore, I agree that what is inconsistant is the application of enforcement, but that's precisely why me and my opponent agree here and discus Rwanda, we see what happens when it is unenforced, a national outrage and death ensure, which is an argument for invasion not against it. My opponent further submits the conduct of the US was poor, that the framework for the legitimization is unfounded. But the documents notes that they (being the US and Iraq) were never coerced into signing, thus the consent of both parties still remains to the document, so I kindly disagree with my oponent here, he should accept the framework for it, this is also because of Nuremburg, Eichmann, Yugoslavia, etc... And although the conduct was poor, this ignores the scandals in which the people prosecuted for it, and furthermore, ignores the JWT. Even then, it's once again an appeal to hypocracy and is irrelevant. There will always be unintentional deaths in War, what matters is the intention in which it takes place. Which was to liberate a people who were massively persecuted. Should they have been left to fend for themselves they would have surely died. The articles: but it does state may , they have the option of giving that consent or not, and even then it is widely known that the UN only can enforce her laws on the basis of voluntarism. The UN can only make recommendations, not enforce the laws it's self, that it requires on it's members. Canada's handling of the native pop. is an example of this. Furthermore, as noted earlier the cases of Yugoslavia, Nuremburg, Eichmann, etc.. All put the genocide conventions in context, that an ""exception"" can be made legally for the party enforcing the law, so long as other means have been tried. The Iraqi Oil for food program didn't work, what esle was there? Invasion. Iraq didn't despute it's legitimacy, nor did it make an exception to the conventions to recognize her constitution over those docs when signing (as noted earlier) case and point, the competent UN organs can be consulted, but the US did simply by using the Conventions. Finally the JWT may use any of those justifications for invasion, I make the case for military necessity due to the pragmatic application of war, a general would be a fool to invade and expect so much as 1 civillian casualty to be criminal, it realistically isn't possible when all other means were tried and death still resulted espescially in the Iraqi Oil program. What else was there? Death by being idle? Or death via invasion for liberation? In short, I still feel the legality of the war is justified. The basis of International Law in which it rests upon may indeed be flawed, but it is necessary. It saved the Kurdish people. Why Vote for Me? Indeed, this shall be a tough case, I have a worthy foe however, here is why I feel I won. -The framework of International Law was used in Eichmann, Nuremburg, etc... so the legality of the framework in it's practical application may be flawed, but it does work and is enforceable. -The Genocide Conventions, Geneva Conventions justify invasion when considering the Oil for Food Program and it's failures, you cannot force Iraq to take food. -UN works on the principals of vulintarism -The inconsistancies of the application for war is Irrelevant (appeal to hypocracy) -Justified on principal (enemy of man, universial jurisdiction, etc..) and humanitarian grounds (no despute that Saddam was a tyrant in need of removal. -The conduct of the US was poor at times, however those people were arrested and tried when they happened. Outrage ensued by public. -We have seen the effects of genocide before, they are not pretty, and thus, there should be no question that invasion was the way to go (espescially Rwanda and the prior knowledge) -There was 12 reasons for going to war, the US only got 2 half-wrong. One of which was the killing of kurds, which is covered under the conventions. Thank you to my opponent for a pleasant exchange!

13,"Alrighty then. Allow me to lay out my case for the affirmative. C1) Similar Interests The U.S. and Israel have morals, rights, and values that reflect each other. What is unique about Israel is that it holds values that are humane when compared with its neighboring countries. Israel has many of the same freedoms that are given in the U.S. Constitution, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly[1]. It can be described as a ""monument of democracy and stability in a region where's there's been little of either""[2]. Since the U.S. holds these values, rights, and morals as important, it has a reason to strengthen other countries such as Israel in order to promote them and keep them existent and alive in a world where rights are often abused. If we were to cut our support, Israel would be weakened and thus more likely to be overrun by surrounding Arab states that do not share these basic human rights. Saudi Arabia is regarded as one of the countries with the lowest political rights and civil liberties[3]. It along with Israel's neighbors, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine are all regarded as ""not free"" with limited rights in each. Saudi Arabia has serious problems with human trafficking, discrimination against women, lack of freedom of religion or speech, and executions of homosexuals[4]. Many of these things can be said for surrounding Arab theocratic states with severe problems. That being said, the strengthening and promotion of these interests are critical in the Middle East, and ought to be acknowledged by the U.S. through an alliance. Political influence has worked before, and can work with Israel and its neighboring countries too. C2) Peace One of the major goals of surrounding Arab countries is to destroy Israel. They have refused to negotiate on treaties and have allowed groups such as Hamas's organization to repeatedly launch rockets into Israel. The IDF has reacted with counter attacks as a means of self-defense, in order to keep Hamas's group away from their country. Israel has had a history of attempts to establish peace with help from the U.S. Their Declaration of Independence reads: "" We appeal in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months to the Arab inhabitants of the state of Israel, to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the state on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions. We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East. ""[5] In the past, there have been many attempts to establish peace from Israel, including Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979[6] and the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty in 1994[7]. The U.S. has historically encouraged these treaties and has made sure that both sides agree to them. However, these instances of peace often exist for short periods of time before violence erupts again. Since peace in the area is something that would be beneficial to everyone, Israel needs America's help through alliance to further work towards establishing peace with the help of Israel. They need the U.S.'s support to be that layer of stability in which a violent society is discouraged and peace is the top priority, as the U.S. has made in the past. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

Since the U.S. holds these values, rights, and morals as important, it has a reason to strengthen other countries such as Israel in order to promote them and keep them existent and alive in a world where rights are often abused. If we were to cut our support, Israel would be weakened and thus more likely to be overrun by surrounding Arab states that do not share these basic human rights.  Saudi Arabia is regarded as one of the countries with the lowest political rights and civil liberties[3]. It along with Israel's neighbors, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine are all regarded as ""not free"" with limited rights in each. Saudi Arabia has serious problems with human trafficking, discrimination against women, lack of freedom of religion or speech, and executions of homosexuals[4]. Many of these things can be said for surrounding Arab theocratic states with severe problems. That being said, the strengthening and promotion of these interests are critical in the Middle East, and ought to be acknowledged by the U.S. through an alliance. Political influence has worked before, and can work with Israel and its neighboring countries too.  C2) Peace  One of the major goals of surrounding Arab countries is to destroy Israel. They have refused to negotiate on treaties and have allowed groups such as Hamas's organization to repeatedly launch rockets into Israel. The IDF has reacted with counter attacks as a means of self-defense, in order to keep Hamas's group away from their country.  Israel has had a history of attempts to establish peace with help from the U.S. Their Declaration of Independence reads:  ""  We appeal in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months to the Arab inhabitants of the state of Israel, to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the state on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.   We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East.  ""[5]  In the past, there have been many attempts to establish peace from Israel, including Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979[6] and the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty in 1994[7]. The U.S. has historically encouraged these treaties and has made sure that both sides agree to them. However, these instances of peace often exist for short periods of time before violence erupts again. Since peace in the area is something that would be beneficial to everyone, Israel needs America's help through alliance to further work towards establishing peace with the help of Israel. They need the U.S.'s support to be that layer of stability in which a violent society is discouraged and peace is the top priority, as the U.S. has made in the past.  [1]   http://www.state.gov...

I would urge that a closer examination of your definition necessitates the following: a leader is greater if the social influence he exerts is a product of his own will, and not due to external circumstances/luck. Simply put, any lucky events that help my goal during my leadership does not necessarily reflect good leadership on my part (just that I'm lucky, or what not). In that case, Hitler was a good leader because he had impressive oratory power, charisma, and a perfect moment for taking advantage of the German people due to the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, depression in 30's, etc. However, a large part of his success relies on the fact that the German people were particularly vulnerable -- at that point of time, many were out the streets looking for job, and in comes Hitler promising populist ideals and an idealized goal. Couple this with his charismatic public persona, and you have a nation quickly bowing down to his feet. While this is impressive in some ways, if the political and economic atmosphere of Germany were different (i.e. better), I suspect the outcome of the Nazi party and Hitler would be much more different, and insignificant. A counter example to your challenge of finding a ""better leader"" would be Alexander the Great. He is without a doubt of of the greatest military commanders, and his influence was immense (pushing Greek culture into foreign land, thus Hellenistic civilization).",1,TheSkeptic,"

Here are the lyrics. Walking alone 'cause the night is dead, Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge. Have you lost your mind, and your wrist got bruised, And you wanted better love Well, its sleeping your bedroom Hold on, stay by my side, don't go. If you could see me, whoever I am, It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones. So come on, love. (Come on, come on, come all and go) Na na na na na na na, I will not let you go. Now I'm walking alone, 'cause the night is dead. My feet don't glide like they did back then. When I called you up, so we could shoot the moon, These days I'm left to howl in tune But hearts do break And I must admit, I've got a better set of chords So I might've been fakin' it. I think I really only cried just once, and so If you could see me, whoever I am It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones. So come on love (come on, come on, come all and go) Na na na na na na na, I will not let you go. If you could see me, whoever I am It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones. Na na na na na na na, I will not let you go.

Since my opponent has no sources to back up his claims I won't give him the benefit of listing mine either. 1) My opponent focuses on the American lives saved, but admits higher casualties. Why does he suppose an American life is more important than any other race's life? Of course they might become insurgents, but so could anyone else, so by my opponent's logic we should kill the entire planet to wipe out insurgency. Further, my opponent fails to relize that one can conceal the entrance to an underground lair, thus thwarting the visual sensors of the drones. My opponent will never win the war on terror by this plan - if civilians become more bombed, more people hate United States, more people join Al Qaeda, simple as that! And you won't even be able to kill Al Qaeda because Al Qaeda knows where to hide, so really you'll just be doing free recruitment for Al Qaeda at a higher cost than it would to get rid of them, as foot soldiers have a proven history of doing. 2) When a terrorist does a suicide bombing, that is not cowardice, that is the ultimate bravery (or so it is percieved) because one has the courage to take up Jihad against the most powerful nation on Earth. If you do not show bravery in your fight, people in Iraq, Afghanistan etc will become angry at you, quit the army that NATO has created in these places and join the Taliban movement. Also, just to remind my opponent, the four years after the States killed al-Zarqawi were the deadliest for troops from that country, and all the martyr videos said the deaths were retribution for al-Zarqawi's death. Finally, my opponent thinks that by conquering all Al Qaeda territory he will conquer Al Qaeda. Not at all. Al Qaeda is a worldwide network, operating in many countries - from Australia to the United States to Uganda (though luckily not my native New Zealand). Osama himself has stated he is not to be found there, but ""amongst the Muslim masses."" 3) Every war is preventable. Take this one in Iraq. Solution - don't invade Iraq (who were clearly not more of a security threat than, say, Israel). Or the one in Afghanistan. Solution - stop the weapons trade with Israel (Al Qaeda has stated that if this happens, they will bring their leaders to the negotiating table). I challenge my opponent to cite a single inevitable war. If we could stop the Cold War from heating, we can stop any war. But this wasn't even my point! The United States, regardless of whether they are the strongest nation in the world or not, has no more right to start wars than any other country. This is guaranteed by international treaties that the United States has ratified. Future governments may begin to start wars at a whim if no human risk is involved. I'm sure my opponent can think where this is leading, three superpowers or so conquer Earth and the book ""1984"" by George Orwell plays out exactly. 4) OK, so we hold the pilots to account, or more accurately, those who failed to give them training in how to recognize the difference between a civilian and a soldier (which is impossible using a drone, meaning any use of a drone should result in prosecution). What difference does it make? It's still illegal. Hiroshima and Nagasaki was before the Geneva convention, which was written after World War 2 to prevent things like Hiroshima or NAZI war crimes from happening again. Like most laws it's not retrospective, so the bomber pilots have immunity. My opponent looks only to saving the lives of Americans whose job it is to put their life on the line for their country. What about innocents in far away lands who only wish to live in peace? Like I said, at least 207 of these people died in an attempt to kill just one Taliban leader using drones. More civilians died in just this one campaign than US soldiers died in all US campaigns over that whole year. If my opponent thinks he knows better than the CIA on piloting drones, I suggest he tries to tell that to them, not me. Drones are prone to failing and crashing, as well as misidentifying targets, not hitting underground targets, recruiting terrorists, proving United States cowardice, breaking the law and promoting a 1984-style world.

23,"I thank Con for their response. I will refute my opponents points. ""This fails to support Pro's position. Abortion isn't unlawful, and abortionists work without malice towards the products of conception."" The only decision made in the abortion process is that of the parents, more commonly that of the women, this gives no opportunity to the child decide their fate. It is solely the parents decision whether or not to carry out the abortion, thus the child has absolutely no say in the matter. "" That would be like having malice towards a piece of bread that you put in the toaster, or towards a lug nut as you tighten it. Does a doctor performing a tonsillectomy have malice toward the tonsils? It's a perfectly ridiculous idea."" ""Was it immoral to smuggle bibles into Russia? Was it immoral to smuggle slaves north out of Dixie?"" I understand that you are trying to make a connection to the above statements and the topic, but this is irrelevant. ""Again, this argument doesn't work in Pro's favor. Pro has no problem with murdering (in his view this is murder) the children of rape and incest victims. Therefore-even if we stipulated that abortion was murder, which we do not-Pro takes the position that murder isn't always wrong."" I stated a few exceptions can be made in the instance of rape and incest. Once again, a far more favorable option would be to allow a doctor to prevent the pregnancy, thus preventing the need for abortion all together. ""Would Pro call it murder to burn a photograph of a human? A parrot that talks like a human? Tonsils that have human DNA?"" You are misinterpreting my criteria for human characteristics. I suppose I mistyped that in some way. Human characteristics such as that of being alive. A heart beat would be an example, embryos clearly have been discovered to have heartbeats, thus being considered murder. ""Pro thinks that a few murders would be good, but he doesn't want too many? Whatever Pro's opinion is, whatever point he's trying to convey, he has not yet had success at getting his point across."" Once again, doctors can prevent pregnancies if instances of rape and incest occur. ""I don't know what the point of this is supposed to be.

I thank Con for their response.  
  
I will refute my opponents points.  
  
""This fails to support Pro's position. Abortion isn't unlawful, and abortionists work without malice towards the products of conception.""  
  
The only decision made in the abortion process is that of the parents, more commonly that of the women, this gives no opportunity to the child decide their fate. It is solely the parents decision whether or not to carry out the abortion, thus the child has absolutely no say in the matter.  
  
"" That would be like having malice towards a piece of bread that you put in the toaster, or towards a lug nut as you tighten it. Does a doctor performing a tonsillectomy have malice toward the tonsils? It's a perfectly ridiculous idea.""  
  
""Was it immoral to smuggle bibles into Russia? Was it immoral to smuggle slaves north out of Dixie?""  
  
I understand that you are trying to make a connection to the above statements and the topic, but this is irrelevant.  
  
""Again, this argument doesn't work in Pro's favor. Pro has no problem with murdering (in his view this is murder) the children of rape and incest victims. Therefore‒even if we stipulated that abortion was murder, which we do not‒Pro takes the position that murder isn't always wrong.""  
  
I stated a few exceptions can be made in the instance of rape and incest.  
Once again, a far more favorable option would be to allow a doctor to prevent the pregnancy, thus preventing the need for abortion all together.  
  
""Would Pro call it murder to burn a photograph of a human? A parrot that talks like a human? Tonsils that have human DNA?""  
  
You are misinterpreting my criteria for human characteristics.  
I suppose I mistyped that in some way.  
Human characteristics such as that of being alive.  
A heart beat would be an example, embryos clearly have been discovered to have heartbeats, thus being considered murder.  
  
""Pro thinks that a few murders would be good, but he doesn't want too many? Whatever Pro's opinion is, whatever point he's trying to convey, he has not yet had success at getting his point across.""  
  
Once again, doctors can prevent pregnancies if instances of rape and incest occur.  
  
""I don't know what the point of this is supposed to be. Is Pro backpedalling, implying that abortion is bad even in the case of rape and incest?""  
  
I am stating that in the cases of rape and incest a much more favorable option than abortion would be to prevent the pregnancy.

Do you need 2.7 Ghz of speed when you only use word and firefox? The answer is absolutely no. This point by my opponent is therefore moot because you can't judge a company by what kind of processors it uses. Also, the Core 2 Duo processor is NOT better than an i3 at processing. the i Series of processors is a significant jump from the Core 2 Duo processor. Even though they both have 2 PHYSICAL processors, which allows them to do two different things at the same time, the i3 has a feature called hyperthreading which allows it to run 2 processing threads on each core.

30,"Clarification The issue of whether we should treat each other well is an issue of human well-being, and therefore, is a human value. So yes, treating each other well is an issue of human well-being. I hope that satisfactorily answers Con's question. Argument P1 : Moral questions are about the well-being of conscious creatures. Well-being is a human value by the definitions made in Round 1. P2 : Well-being relates to physical states of the brain. P3 : Science can tell us what actions improve or hurt human human well-being. C : Science can determine human values. Premise One All moral questions are reducible to the well-being of conscious creatures. For instance, the moral issue of whether women should be forced to wear hijab is a question relating to well-being. Does it make human beings more compassionate to one another? Does it make life safer for the woman (prevented rape, etc)? Does it improve the woman and her mental health? These are all questions relating to the well-being of conscious creatures. We do not feel moral obligations to rocks or lightbulbs, as they are not conscious creatures. They are only inanimate objects. I suppose that one could argue that we have moral obligations to inanimate objects, but ultimately, that could be reduced to the well-being of conscious creatures as well. Due to the fact that humans only feel moral obligations to conscious creatures, it is becoming clear that the well-being of conscious creatures is the central point of morality. I understand that I have presented only one example of a case where a moral issue relates to the well-being of conscious creatures. Obviously, it is impossible to type out every moral question and then prove that it relates to the well-being of conscious creatures. Therefore, in order to refute this premise, I ask Con to present a moral issue that does not relate to the well-being of conscious creatures. Premise Two This claim is rather overt, unless one wishes to undermine a very fundamental aspect of modern day neuroscientific research. Neuroscience (italics are from 'The Compass of Pleasure' by David Linden) shows that when neurons in the region called the ventral tagmental area (VTA) are active, brief electrical impulses (called spikes) race from their cell bodies (located in the VTA proper) along long, thin information-sending fibers called axons. The axons have specialized structures at the endpoints called axon terminals. Some of the axon terminals of the VTA nuerons are located some distance away in a region called the nucleus acumbens. When the traveling electric spikes reach the axon terminals, they trigger the release of the neurotrantsmitter dopamine, which is stored in the terminals in the tiny membrane-bound blobs called vesicles. When a spike enters the axon terminal, it iniates a complex series of electrical and chemical events that result in the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the membrane of the axon terminal, thereby causing the contents the vesicle, including the dopamine neurons, to be released into a narrow fluid-filled space surronding the axon termal called the synaptic cleft. The dopamine molecules then diffuse and bind to specialized dopamine receptors on their target neurons, initiating a series of chemical signs therein. The experiments that cause the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA to be active and thereby release dopamine in their targets will be felt as pleasurable, and the sensory cues and actions that preceded and overlped with those pleasurable experiences will be rememebred and associated with positive feelings. Neuroscientific research shows that states of the brain are responsible for our feelings of well-being, such as pleasure. I also wish to point out that the atatomy of a rat's pleasure circuit is very similar to that of our own. This brings experiments such as those done by psychologist B.F. Skinner with rats that found the reward circuits of their brain. The main point that I am making is that pleasure (and therefore well-being) has a neurological basis. Premise 3 I wish to bring us back to my earlier example in Premise 1 of women being forced to wear hijab. I gave an example of three questions we could ask if we were to try and discover what impacts compulsory hijab has on a woman and society. These questions all fall under the domain of scientific research. Scientific research can be conducted to investigate the affect that compulsory hijab has on compassion or the mental health of women who are forced to wear hijab. Science could also determine if wearing hijab makes one any else likely to get raped, and it can also tell us why people rape other people in the first place. That would also work to help us decide the affect of hijab on well-being. Science can also analyze the physical states of the brain, and determine if an action has harmed or improved the well-being of the subject. Conclusion The well-being of conscious creatures is the central point of moral questions and values. The well-being of conscious creatures is a human value. Well-being is sourced in the physical states of the brain. Science can tell us if actions improve well-being or not. Therefore, science can determine human values.

Secondly, why did the authors not show which region the spectra come from. This is an important question, as it leads to the fact that Fig 16 is doubtful as where Si is abundant, we also see that Fe and O are similarly abundant.

46,"Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections. My partner and I are on the con side. Our points are: 1. The Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. 2.there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts 3.Direct popular vote is flawed in many ways 4.The Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. My first point is the Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. According to Kristina Dell, ""with a direct popular vote...the selection of the president would often be the biggest, most populous states with little attention paid to smaller ones."" Without the Electoral College the voices of small states would be drowned out by the larger ones. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans says, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the Electoral College are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states."" The Electoral College is a necessity in order to give small states the right to have a voice in presidential elections. My second point is that there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts. As Professor Judith Best argues, ""an electoral system should produce a definite, accepted winner and avoid prolonged contests and disputes that create uncertainty and public turmoil."" This is the function now played by the Electoral College. To its defenders, it does so in two ways. One, it saves the nation ""from the effects of a vague outcome."" In this way, it confers the necessary legitimacy even in the face of close elections. And two, it also ""protects the nation from the crisis of a disputed election."" In a direct popular vote, during a close election, candidates will be too tempted to challenge every result. Whereas before if you carry a state by 10% there is no reason to challenge under the Electoral College, now a nationwide deadlock will ensure each state undergoes a recount. The judiciary committee once again explains, if one candidate contests a certain area, his opponent, to protect himself, warns of a contest where he thinks something might have been adverse to him. And in a little while, the whole electorate is involved. My third point is that direct popular vote is flawed in many ways. Proponents of a direct popular vote too often over simplify the question at hand. They fail to realize that, like any other system, direct popular vote will be vulnerable to numerous problems. One such problem is the increased threat of vote fraud. The Electoral College is a series of self-sealing containers, so that each state does not influence the outcome of another. If fraud occurs, it is isolated. In a direct election, however, each vote is of premium importance to the national decision. As such, agents within the election will have a far greater decision to influence votes. Consider an election that stays in an almost complete deadlock throughout the day. As word travels, the urgency of West Coast votes becomes so great that the temptation to commit fraud by local officials is overwhelming. The election is then illegitimate. The Electoral College avoids this because even if one county of one state commits fraud, it will not be enough to impact the overall election. (This is why I urge you to vote con) My fourth point is the Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. The cornerstone of democracy is not majority rule. It is reasonable majority rule with the protection of minority rights. A nation is far better served when moderate ideologies prevail. This government ensures liberty and equality maintain an optimal balance for all citizens. As former senator James Eastland writes, ""Because of winner-take-all (under the electoral system), a party is under a strong inducement to extend its platform as widely as possible within each State; it must expand its base of support to carry a popular plurality. Since both major parties face the same requirement, both must campaign in most of the same places before most of the same votes. Both must be hospitable to a wide range of minority interest which might otherwise be excluded from electoral competition."" This has so many great benefits, including reasonable polices that are widely appropriate in nature. Under a direct popular vote, no such system would hold. Candidates must currently be able to get a majority of votes in a statewide election to obtain even a single electoral vote. Ideologically extreme candidates are discouraged from running because they know they cannot appeal to that wide of an electorate. Under direct popular vote, however, there is no need to win statewide majorities and therefore elections will become crowded with extreme candidates.

He or she will be the voice of only a few. This is why I urge you to vote con",1,cyman,"
  
Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections. My partner and I are on the con side. Our points are:  
1. The Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections.  
2.there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts  
3.Direct popular vote is flawed in many ways  
4.The Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority.  
My first point is the Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. According to Kristina Dell, ""with a direct popular vote...the selection of the president would often be the biggest, most populous states with little attention paid to smaller ones."" Without the Electoral College the voices of small states would be drowned out by the larger ones. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans says, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the Electoral College are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states."" The Electoral College is a necessity in order to give small states the right to have a voice in presidential elections.  
My second point is that there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts. As Professor Judith Best argues, ""an electoral system should produce a definite, accepted winner and avoid prolonged contests and disputes that create uncertainty and public turmoil."" This is the function now played by the Electoral College. To its defenders, it does so in two ways. One, it saves the nation ""from the effects of a vague outcome."" In this way, it confers the necessary legitimacy even in the face of close elections. And two, it also ""protects the nation from the crisis of a disputed election."" In a direct popular vote, during a close election, candidates will be too tempted to challenge every result. Whereas before if you carry a state by 10% there is no reason to challenge under the Electoral College, now a nationwide deadlock will ensure each state undergoes a recount. The judiciary committee once again explains, if one candidate contests a certain area, his opponent, to protect himself, warns of a contest where he thinks something might have been adverse to him. And in a little while, the whole electorate is involved.  
My third point is that direct popular vote is flawed in many ways. Proponents of a direct popular vote too often over simplify the question at hand. They fail to realize that, like any other system, direct popular vote will be vulnerable to numerous problems. One such problem is the increased threat of vote fraud. The Electoral College is a series of self-sealing containers, so that each state does not influence the outcome of another. If fraud occurs, it is isolated. In a direct election, however, each vote is of premium importance to the national decision. As such, agents within the election will have a far greater decision to influence votes. Consider an election that stays in an almost complete deadlock throughout the day. As word travels, the urgency of West Coast votes becomes so great that the temptation to commit fraud by local officials is overwhelming. The election is then illegitimate. The Electoral College avoids this because even if one county of one state commits fraud, it will not be enough to impact the overall election.  
(This is why I urge you to vote con)  
My fourth point is the Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. The cornerstone of democracy is not majority rule. It is reasonable majority rule with the protection of minority rights. A nation is far better served when moderate ideologies prevail. This government ensures liberty and equality maintain an optimal balance for all citizens. As former senator James Eastland writes, ""Because of winner-take-all (under the electoral system), a party is under a strong inducement to extend its platform as widely as possible within each State; it must expand its base of support to carry a popular plurality. Since both major parties face the same requirement, both must campaign in most of the same places before most of the same votes. Both must be hospitable to a wide range of minority interest which might otherwise be excluded from electoral competition."" This has so many great benefits, including reasonable polices that are widely appropriate in nature. Under a direct popular vote, no such system would hold. Candidates must currently be able to get a majority of votes in a statewide election to obtain even a single electoral vote. Ideologically extreme candidates are discouraged from running because they know they cannot appeal to that wide of an electorate. Under direct popular vote, however, there is no need to win statewide majorities and therefore elections will become crowded with extreme candidates. This will further polarize politics as candidates make specific appeals to narrow voter interests. Then, the President will not be elected by a large body politic. He or she will be the voice of only a few.

3a. Evolution has never been observed. Science cannot function without empirical evidence, and we have never gathered any such evidence for evolution.

China's trade practices with the United States have resulted in a detrimental impact on jobs. Due to Chinese imports outweighing US exports, trade with China has resulted in a loss of nearly three million jobs between 2001 and 2010 [1], with some states, such as New Hampshire, losing over two percent of total state employment due to China [1]. It has been concluded that these lost jobs, especially in manufacturing, are almost entirely the fault of China [2], and not the US'. With this tremendous loss of jobs, it is abundantly clear that China negatively affects the economy of the US, especially in jobs. 2.) China's economic policies threaten the United States dollar. Recently, China has been buying a large amount of gold in an attempt to replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency [3]. This, along with their goal of allowing the yuan, China's currency, to be traded freely would result in the weakening of the US dollar's dominance as the international reserve currency, making it more expensive for the US government to borrow money and to run perpetual trade and budget deficits [3]. 3.) The rise of China threatens the United States' national security. a.) Iran China has a close relation with Iran, using its powerful position in the United Nations to protect Iran from UN sanctions [4]. China is also investing in several oil programs in Iran [4], assisting Iran's economy, in turn funding programs that threaten the security of the US. This results in grave threats to the US' security and stability. b.) Cyber-attacks China currently contains several powerful telecommunications companies, which China has the means, opportunity and motive to use against the United States and commit espionage [5]. Several cyber-attacks against the United States have also been traced back to the United States [5], necessitating an urge to avoid these companies to avoid further attacks on America. Chinese actors are moving into increasingly advanced operations against specialized targets [6], which further threatens the United States' security. Since China threatens the United States economy by causing a tremendous loss of jobs as well as attempting to weaken the dollar as well as threatening national security through Iran and cyber-attacks, it is clear that the rise of China directly threatens the interests of the United States.

65,"Thank you, Bricheze, for accepting this debate. As my opponent is debating the pro/aff, she must be able to prove that retreating is not the better option in any scenario but one. I will first state my case, then move onto my opponent's I do not agree with the following statement of Stalin: ""Die, but do not retreat."" Retreat is defined as ""the forced or strategic withdrawal of an army or an armed force before an enemy"" - dictionary.com Arthur Wellesley, during Bonaparte's 100 day campaign, retreated from Quatre Bras to Waterloo in order for an easier win. If Wellesley had not retreated, Bonaparte would have most likely won. From a military standpoint, it was a better decision to retreat to Waterloo. This is a situation where it is better to retreat than to die. Another example from the Napoleonic Era involves the Russians. When Bonaparte marched into Russia with 500-600,000 men, the Russians retreated and applied a scorched earth policy. Bonaparte and his men went all the way to Moscow and got nothing as the city had been burnt down. Napoleon turned around at Moscow. The Russians suffered few casualties and the French army had been decimated to a mere 10,000. This is another situation where it is better to retreat than to die. The definition of retreat says that it can be for a strategic withdrawal. And as my two examples above show, it is better to retreat now and then for the purpose of strategy. From a less literal view, the statement ""die, but do not retreat"" is not always the wisest choice. For instance, when arguing with someone, and the facts say you are wrong, the wisest course of action is to concede defeat. If you know you are blatantly wrong, to continue arguing would be futile. It is not always about supporting your views. If you think it is right go ahead and believe it all you want, even if you cannot explain why you believe it, but in an argument give up and leave once you are proven wrong. ----------------------------------------------------My opponent's case-------------------------------------------------------------- My opponent agrees with the quote for the following reasons: 1) Retreating weakens you and strengthens the opposition 2) By being persistent you may outlast the opposition 3) The damage done to you as a result of persisting may cause the opposition to stop fighting 4) By persisting you become more memorable in history For the first reason my opponent claims that retreating is giving up and thus you lose a battle and your opponent has the better hand in the following battle. This is does not work because retreating can be used as a strategy. As I showed in my examples, retreating can be used to strengthen yourself rather than your opponent. And again, my opponent must prove the statement true in all situations. My opponent's second reason is something that has little opportunity of working. An army will most likely not run away because the other is ""scarier."" Rather, they would surrender or retreat to safety to decide on a better course of action. Proving your worth by fighting until the end is not a good incentive for the soldiers. If you go and tell your soldiers, to be remembered you must die, do you really think they would care to be remembered? I would think the answer would be ""no."" The soldiers will not do their best if this is their motivation. Now the three things my opponent says the opposition may realize: A) You will not back down, and they will either have to destroy you or leave you alone. If they went through the trouble of trying to kill you, then they will continue to try to kill you. And if they would attempt to destroy you, would that not be worse for you? By retreating you can regroup into a more effective attack. Which makes it harder for the opposition. B) You will do a lot of damage to their troops--raising the question: Is it worth it? But you are fighting to the death, in such a case the casualties lay more heavily on your side, meaning less damage to the opposition in the following attack. Worsening the situation does not benefit you. C) You are strong and will continue to fight until we are demolished or you die. Next time, they could come in larger numbers and be even more powerful, could we lose the next battle? Should we continue? This is basically B in other words. So the previous argument applies here as well. With larger numbers, it would be easier for you, but why would the opposition not have a larger army? You do not send out the whole army to one battle. The numbers will not matter too much. My opponent moves on to saying this is a useful tactic. But when it hurts you rather than help you, it cannot be useful unless you are trying to lose. For my opponent's last argument of proving yourself, becoming more memorable in history, I would like to bring back the incentive that this is supplying: ""to be remembered, you must die."" If this was true, I would not want to be remembered. I think that many people would agree with me on this as well. I await my opponent's response.",1,karththegeld,"

You misinterpreted. The dictionaries don't prescribe the universal death model because they don't make any prescriptions-- they just say, in essence, morality is morality, and don't go any further really in telling you what the word means :). It is they, not the ""universal death"" model that my statements don't contradict :). "". Instead it discusses Eudaimonia, commonly translated as happiness, but usually seen as having connotations with virtue and knowledge.he section referring to Aristotle says: ""Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty, pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial) friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental and/or unchanging is the best).Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However, unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure."" It sounds like the Aristotelian position supports the established version and if anyone is backing up my opponent it is the hedonist Epicurus.

"" My opponent seems here to be cheerfully condoning murder and rape as well as torture. Is he saying that if someone pushes you, you can murder them?"" Would it be conducive to one's life to attempt to murder someone every time they push you? I think not. Surely more egregious force would be required to practically justify such a retaliation. I was merely delineating the principle on which such an action would be automatically excluded from consideration.

""  
My opponent seems to have manoeuvred this debate away from a discussion of the rights and wrongs of water boarding (which he does not refer to once in round 2) and seems determined to defend his peculiar (if not ""bizarre"") idea of morality.""  
It's not steering the debate away from A to discuss X if A's truth or falsehood is dependent on X's truth or falsehood.  
  
""  
This would appear to basically consist of self-preservation with a slight touch of hedonism. It is an interpretation I am not really familiar with but sounds similar to the amorality (unconcerned with right and wrong) of Aleistair Crowley who's philosophy was ""do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.""""  
How is ""doing what thou wilt"" in any way similar to doing what will keep you alive and hopefully happy (alive being the first requirement)? Surely telling someone considering drugs to ""do what thou wilt"" isn't good for their life :).  
  
""  
I am glad that he feels his own interpretation (supposedly) backed up by his one cited source (Wikepedia) is superior to that of several reputable dictionaries and although this opinion radically redefines morality it is in fact not contradictory of the ""universal death"" model.""  
You misinterpreted. The dictionaries don't prescribe the universal death model because they don't make any prescriptions-- they just say, in essence, morality is morality, and don't go any further really in telling you what the word means :). It is they, not the ""universal death"" model that my statements don't contradict :).  
  
"". Instead it discusses Eudaimonia, commonly translated as happiness, but usually seen as having connotations with virtue and knowledge.he section referring to Aristotle says:  
""Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty, pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial) friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental and/or unchanging is the best).Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However, unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure.""  
It sounds like the Aristotelian position supports the established version and if anyone is backing up my opponent it is the hedonist Epicurus.  
""  
You missed the ""human flourishing"" part, the ""complete life"" part, the ""non-sacrificial"" part-- need I go on?  
  
""  
My opponent seems here to be cheerfully condoning murder and rape as well as torture.  
Is he saying that if someone pushes you, you can murder them?""  
Would it be conducive to one's life to attempt to murder someone every time they push you? I think not. Surely more egregious force would be required to practically justify such a retaliation. I was merely delineating the principle on which such an action would be automatically excluded from consideration.

76,"I would like to thank my opponent for his timely response. My opponent claims that the prisoner would not feel as much pain as they would in the electric chair. This is in fact, false. The electric chair happens very quick, and very fast. It is said by some that the person is dead before they can even feel anything. Also, the electric chair is not always what murderers get. Usually they get the lethal injection, or simply life in prison. On the other hand, you have no proof that the cannibals would not bring them any pain.

I would like to thank my opponent for his timely response. My opponent claims that the prisoner would not feel as much pain as they would in the electric chair. This is in fact, false. The electric chair happens very quick, and very fast. It is said by some that the person is dead before they can even feel anything. Also, the electric chair is not always what murderers get. Usually they get the lethal injection, or simply life in prison.  
  
On the other hand, you have no proof that the cannibals would not bring them any pain. But even if they did not, it would be a very good mental punishment. How would you feel if you knew you were going to be eaten in a few days. There would probably be less murders.

The controversy of the election started before the election. 1. Constitutionally illegitimate candidate: Daniel Ortega was violating the Nicaraguan constitution in both the term limits, and the running consecutive terms. In the Nicaraguan constitution it is stipulated that the president cannot run for more than two terms, and a president cannot run in consecutive terms. This is to prevent a dictatorial regime, and put a safeguard on the democratic process. Simply by running he is in violation of the country's constitution, and his blatant disregard for the rule of law, and the rule of the land is justification alone for a country that values the integrity of the electoral process to not acknowledge this man in his bid for re-election. [1] [Although the elections of the national seats that took place in this last election are also fraught with fraud, I will keep the argument to Daniel Ortega, since he is running as President, and it is he who the US Government would recognize.] It is key in understanding how Ortega has held and grown his control over the country, by understanding the role his party, the Sandinista Party his played in the country since he gained control. All possible judges, particularly Supreme Court Judges, and election officials are Sandinista, all police force and military forces are loyal to the Sandinistas over the Nicaraguan people. Sufficient branches of government and those with influence over the economy are loyal Sandinistas to facilitate Ortega's designs. 2. Fraudulent electoral process: The Ortega administration mandated, prior to the election, an identity card would be required for the election, and these cards would need to be obtained through members of the FSLN (Sandinista Party). Members of FSLN easily and quickly received their cards, whereas other requestors of the identity cards were waiting for a year or more. Essentially Ortega achieved an election that would be wholly managed by his party the Sandinistas, and two thirds of the places in Nicaragua were run by Sandinistas, and those that were not had the greatest instances of identity card rejection.[ 2] At the time of election the voter must present this identity card, and it must have an authorized stamp that the Sandinistas created. Without that stamp the identity card was invalid, and countless identity cards were found invalid because they did not have the proper stamp, all those people were not Sandinista. The incidents of fraud are too numerous to list, and was so rampant that it will never be truly documented. [3] The entire election was controlled and managed by the Sandinistas under the dictates of Daniel Ortega, for the benefit of Daniel Ortega's reelection and total control over the Nicaraguan people. [4] 3. Impact of fraudulent election in Nicaragua: With a total disregard to the constitution in the running of Daniel Ortega as president violating the constitution, and the principles that safe guard its people from a dictator he degrades the constitution in its intended purpose of providing a democratic rule of checks and balances over the land. What is even more important to note is that if a president is elected with more than 50% of the popular vote he is empowered to change the constitution as he sees fit. This is a massive coup of power to the presidency, and by illegally obtaining that number of votes he has effectively taken control of all aspects of governance within the country. It is a true theft of total power with the obvious intentions of a dictatorial regime in perpetuity. It is also important to understand the corruption within the Ortega regime, and the personal corruption of the man. He has become one of the richest men in Central America, leader of the second poorest countries in the hemisphere.

So while Pro figures that a tax will provide a good stream of revenue to other programs, it'll actually decrease the stream of revenue because less people will buy the product. The price elasticity of demand measures whether a 1% increase in price leads to a greater than 1% decrease in demand for it. If it exceeds a 1% loss in demand, total revenue will fall and they'd have been better off not increasing the price at all. Fast food consumers are extremely sensitive to increases in price. They have a dollar menu at practically every fast food establishment. Cheap food is a hallmark of the unhealthy food industry. The whole target market for this industry would be alienated with the introduction of a new tax. Total revenue would fall substantially.

As of now, our progress toward achieving AI is roughly equivalent to the progress the first man to climb a tree made towards landing on the moon.

101,"I was involved in a rather unpleasant incident on a British Airways flight from Aberdeen to Heathrow recently. (1) The aircraft was an Airbus A319 with a single economy (coach) class cabin which was fitted with seats with a width of 17.0"" (2) and the aisle seat I was allocated was located next to a grossly overweight gentleman, whose considerable girth was overflowing onto my seat, thus preventing me from putting the armrest down or fastening my seatbelt. I therefore challenged the man and here is the gist of the ensuing confrontation: Me: Excuse me, you appear to be sitting on part of my seat, would you be kind enough to move over so I can sit down? Overweight Passenger: I'm sorry, but I'm as far over as I can get. Me: Then may I suggest you move somewhere else where there are two free seats together? Overweight Passenger: Well, I don't think there are any left. If only they made the seats bigger there wouldn't be a problem. Me: Well the seats seem big enough for everybody else and the fact is, there is a problem and that problem is that I paid over two hundred and fifty quid for a seat that is being partly occupied by a great sweating pile of flab, so what are you going to do about it, pieface? Overweight Passenger: Well, if you are going to take that attitude... Me: Yes I am going to take that attitude - I think I'm entitled to under the circumstances, don't you? I mean how much money did you contribute towards the cost of my seat? That's right, not a penny. So what makes you think you are entitled to sit on part of it then, eh? At this juncture a stewardess came up and asked if she could help so I politely explained the situation and asked her to displace the overweight passenger so that I could duly take my seat. However, she said that the plane was full and suggested that I take a jump seat instead. Naturally, I refused to sit on a tip-up seat at the front of the cabin being stared at by the rest of the passengers like I was some naughty schoolboy who'd been told to stand in the corner of the classroom as a punishment - what, just so that some greedy fat bloke could sit in the seat that I'd paid over 250 for? I don't think so! By then, the plane's engines were being wound up and the aircraft was clearly ready to push back from the gate. The stewardess started to get really anxious then because all passengers must by law be seated with belts fastened while the plane is taxiing, so she went into the cockpit. She reappeared a minute or two later, and said to me that she was very sorry, but since I was last on board the captain had instructed her to offload me and explained that the ground crew would rebook me onto the next available flight, unless I was willing to take a jump seat, of course. I suggested that it might be more appropriate, all considered, for the oversized gentleman whose blubber was spilling all over my seat to get the naughty chair, but she was afraid that jump seats were not designed to accommodate people of his size. So, given that the flight was only an hour and a half long, I reluctantly strapped myself into the jump seat and resigned myself to an uncomfortable journey watching old Five Bellies lolling around on my seat, scoffing airline grub and guzzling down bottle after bottle of complimentary booze. To my mind, there is something fundamentally unjust about people of normal weight having to make sacrifices for the fat on planes. After all, 99% of people who are overweight are so because they are greedy and lazy, not because they have some medical condition. (3) When I got back, I visited British Airways' website to check what their policy on seating the fat is. This is what it says: ""British Airways offers its customers the ability to book an extra seat. There are many reasons why a customer might book an extra seat, the most common are for...Personal comfort - The customer requires more space than one seat provides, due to oversize..."" (4) You will note that booking an extra seat is merely an option - it's not compulsory. However, it's a whole different ball game when it comes to baggage. If your hand luggage exceeds certain dimensions and cannot fit into the cradle at check-in, you are obliged to check it into the hold - which is something many airlines now charge for. (5) Surely the same principle should be applied to fat passengers? If they are unable to fit into a cradle measuring the dimensions of a seat, they should be made to pay for two seats or otherwise be refused boarding. Thank you.

Their bodies twisted and mutated to produce extremely unstable chemicals, infested soldiers long only to find the Swarm's enemies and destroy them by detonating their own bodies in a cloud of toxic fluid. As with other Zerg ground units, an Infested Terran also has the ability to Burrow. The Infested Terrans have the capability to inflict up to 500 points of explosive splash damage to any unit or structure. To reach their full destructive potential, an Infested Terran must be commanded to target a specific unit or structure, but they can also be commanded to target an area within the proximity of several units or structures. The splash damage from the exploding Infested Terran will cause massive damage to all nearby targets. Thus once again the zerg have the advantage over terran because they can turn terran into suicide bombers working for them. Zerg also have the lurker. Lurkers emit waves of supra-dense spines against their enemies and actually burrow under the ground. Once underground, a Lurker can utilize a series of spines that rip up through the ground in a straight line from the Lurker to its target. These spines continue to their maximum attack range, regardless of where the targeted unit lies within that path and every enemy unit in the path of the spines will take damage. If he decides to take his base and move it I can attack with Mutalisks. The Mutalisk serves as the basic flying support unit for the Zerg and has the ability to strike both air and ground targets. The Scourge are the zerg actual kamikaze units and explode killing air/ground people. So, whether the terran base decides to pick up and move I can attack it. So, I can rush or wait later in the game and I will end up winning because the zerg have superior units, can be used by new players, can be used quickly by rushing, and overall destroy the terran.",1,Justinisthecrazy,"

104,"I thank my opponent for his response. First off, my opponent is quick to state the good deeds Lady GaGa does for the gay community. Now, if we were talking about Lady GaGa as a person or for her stances on the issues that matter, we'd be having a different conversation entirely. However, we are not arguing on that basis. The debate is solely about the impact of her music and her music alone, the message it delivers and the reactions that it provokes, not the outside factors that help contribute to her image that have nothing to do with her music. I intend to focus on music an lyrics alone. Second, my opponent admits in his OWN argument that her lyrics are shallow. I would now like to delve deeper into some of those lyrics. Here are a few highlights from the song 'Just Dance': ""I've had a little bit too much All of the people start to rush... "" ""Can't find my drink or man. Where are my keys, I lost my phone..."" ""I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore... Keep it cool what's the name of this club? I can't remember but it's alright, alright."" Now, these are only the highlights from the first verse alone. From these, three things can be determined: 1. She's had too much to drink 2. From this intoxication from, assuredly, alcohol, she has lost her date, glass, keys, and phone 3. Is so drunk she can't see straight 4. Doesn't remember where she is, let alone see 5. All of this is okay. While all of these things mentioned certainly do happen, I do not believe that they have a certainly good message. For instance, according to <URL>... : ""...Similarly, approximately one-half of all sexual assault victims report that they were drinking alcohol at the time of the assault, with estimates ranging from 30 to 79 percent..."" Which, according to Gaga, is okay. But why let me argue this when she can? For instance, in continuation with the lyrics: ""Just dance. Gunna be okay. Da-doo-doo-doo Just dance. Spin that record babe. Da-doo-doo-doo Just dance. Gunna be okay. Duh-duh-duh-duh Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-just dance."" See? Everything' s fine! Until ... ""Wish I could shut my playboy mouth. How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out babe. Control your poison babe Roses with thorns they say. And we're all gettin' hosed tonight. What's go-ing out on the floor? "" This stanza seems to implicate that Gaga, even though she has a date, is still insisting on getting naked for, well, it seems, almost no reason at all except to, well, get naked... ...as evidenced by the next stanza, where she says... ""When I come through on the dance floor checkin out that catalogue. Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw. And I ain't gonn' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like the car I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it and flex until the til done until tomorr' yeah. Show me I can see that you got so much in the jean The way you twirling up them hips round and round There's no reason, I know why you can't leave here with me In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down."" See! Even she says that there need be no reason at all! According to the Center for Disease Control, there were 1,210,523 cases of Chlamydia observed in 2008. There were also 336,742 cases of gonorrhea observed in 2008. Most of us know that these diseases are contracted by having sex without protection and, in this case, just for the sake of it. So, according to Lady Gaga, this action, which causes a more likely chance to contract a disease such as Chlamydia or gonorrhea, is acceptable, and, through her lyrics, is telling the listening community that it is acceptable. This is a woman in the forefront of the news and yes, unbelievably, music industry. A role model. And Lady GaGa says it is okay to take un-necessary chances just for a good time. Also, she's, according to her lyrics, psychotic: ""I'm psychotic synchypnotic I got my blue burners and phonic I'm psychotic synchypnotic I got my brand electronic"" That, normally. isn't good.

Admit impediments. Love is not love  
Which alters when it alteration finds,  
Or bends with the remover to remove:  
O no; it is an ever-fixed mark,  
That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;  
It is the star to every wandering bark,  
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.  
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks  
Within his bending sickle's compass come;  
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,  
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.  
If this be error and upon me proved,  
I never writ, nor no man ever loved. ""  
  
now this poem by dean is full of more longing more passion more love than this boring sonnet 116

""Breathe thy hot breath into my ear  
Breathe thy hot breath that I can hear the pounding of thy heart for I to hear thy soul cry out for I  
Linger on my neck  
Linger on my neck with thy soft kiss kiss my neck with the soft touch of thy soul linger linger and sigh out thy soul o""er the flesh of I with thy soft kiss breathe out thy love for I from the soul of thine warm my flesh burn my flesh with the hot passion of thine  
Oh oh give me thy soul along the flesh of I give me thy soul to make my eyes to cry my love for thee oh come beloved and make my heart to thud and my veins to sing with thy lips make my ears ring with the love thee does to I do bring oh oh ever so slowly run thy lips o""er the neck of I kiss dabbing dab dab dabbing """,Arts,0,This-must-be-the-greatest-love-poem-ever/1/,67928
107,"In my opponent's argument he tried to explain that specific people, have with certain actions lost the the unalienable, most basic and most important right for a peaceful democratic society, the right to live. I clearly am against this theory and here is why: A.) Me and my opponent live in democratic countries and all democratic societies are based on 3 UNALIENABLE rights, that me and my opponent have sworn to protect as citizens of these countries, these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness with life being the most valuable of the three. Notice that these rights are considered unalienable and can't be taken away. So taking life away is schizophrenic after agreeing not to and is against our law, beliefs and principles no matter what we believe about the death penalty and such ides are against democracy itself. B.) Also, killing a man/woman to convince others not to kill is absurd. C.) Instead of depriving this human being of his/her right to live you can put them in prison this more effective than the brutal action of killing for many reasons. First of all, the criminal is still punished severely for his acts and perhaps even in a worse way than death would punish him (many prisoners in Europe have asked to be killed). Also, it keeps him away from society, thus keeps everyone safe from him/her almost as effectively as killing him/her and scares other potential criminals and keeps them from repeating this act, just as well as the death penalty. Additionally, it is less brutal and violent, thus it suits our modern society better than killing. Also it can be reversed unlike killing in case of a miracle that somehow proves the victim innocent..Additionally, one has to keep in mind that a person who committed an act bad enough to be executed for it is definitely ill. His problems were caused by society and society should be the one to correct them. This human should be given a chance to overcome his problems and not be killed because of them. This person has a need to be accepted again he needs to feel useful and that there is a chance for him to be forgiven. My opponent also asked why this man or woman should continue living. The answer to this is simple. Above I have proved that: A.) First of all, he has a right to life , a right given to him by his Creator (Declaration of Independence) and no human has a right to rob him of that right because then he/she will be just as bad as the criminal. B.) Life has taught us that nothing is definite. So this man needs to stay alive just in case evidence, after his conviction proves him innocent. C.) His problems should be corrected and he/she has to be accepted again. If a better punishment has been(special prison) has been thought of, and if the criminal benefits while it makes no difference to anyone else's interests ,and the death penalty is an old, brutal, unethical method and is accepted by fewer countries as the years go by, then why in the name of god should we go against our own beliefs as citizens of democratic countries and act as badly as plain murderers and kill in order to punish killing and sentence a human being that just maybe despite all odds be found innocent later to death???",1,liberty,"

109,"Those are some interesting arguments. A note on base-systems (for readers): Base systems are basically how we count. Our current system is base on tens, hence the name 'ten-based'. This is so because we have 10 digits ""0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"". The digit in the 'ones' place tells us how many single units there are, the 'tens' place how many tens etc. So 23 tells us we have 3 ones and 2 tens. Now, what if we switched to the two-base system called binary? To start, we only have two digits: 0 and 1. The first digit still tells us how many ones we have, but the second tells us how many twos we have, the third tells us fours, the fourth tells us eight etc. So in binary, 1 is what we know as 1, but 10 is what we know as 2 (we have zero 1s and one 2). 11 is three, 100 is 4, 101 is 5, 110 is 6, and so on.

Terrorists are not scared of death and will commit suicide for their cause, and will use any means to kill. They will use deadly weapons to achieve these means. The reason terrorists are able to obtain weapons such as RPG's and road side bombs and IED's is because they are being funded by corrupt people and corrupt government officials.

He is directly funding the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia), who are heavily involved in drug trafficking, and kidnapping, murdering, and use IED's to destroy towns. A computer was recovered on a Columbian military raid, the computer owned by Ral Reyes (second in command of the FARC) documents show ties between Ecuador and also shows Chavez directly funded the FARC 300 million dollars. The money was going to be used to purchase uranium for nuclear weapon development. Venezuelan authorities have let the FARC drug traffic run freely through their country an estimated 300 tons annually to be exported to the US and Europe, A very profitable agreement between the FARC and Chavez.

These cards help terrorists come across the US border and will soon strike in not only American cities but in cities around the world. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spent over $2.17 billion in 2005 to acquire Russian assault rifles and helicopters, Spanish transport aircraft and missile-capable corvettes, and Brazilian turboprop light attack aircraft. Chavez also bought 100,000 AK-103 and AK-104 assault rifles that were delivered in 2006. On Feb. 4, however, Chavez said that ""100,000 rifles are not enough,"" and declared that many more rifles are needed to arm his one million-strong military reserve, that's another 900,000 rifles to buy. The Chavez government's shopping list for 2006 includes MiG-29 Fulcrums, possibly Sukhoi SU-27 Flankers, and air defense missiles, including both man-portable and vehicle-mounted SAMs. Chavez said in 2005 that he would buy up to 50 MiG-29 Fulcrums in a deal worth up to $5 billion.

115,"Oooohh this just got serious! Thank you for your arguments, Pro. R1. ""My opponent claims that women wrestling would be ""lame to watch"" because they are ""done"" with physical activities. This is absolutely untrue. My opponent brings up a faulty claim without evidence. Growing mature wouldn't cause women to lose interest in physical activities. This is why professional female soccer players, tennis players, and wrestlers exist (these are only couple of examples). Women still have interest in sports. Women, like men, enjoy physical activities."" I am a woman too. I do a ton of physical activities (sports). But I am thirteen. I have not fully grown in my physical body futures!!! I play every sport (basketball, softball/baseball, tennis, volleyball, soccer) except wrestling (and boxing and Lecross). Main reason is because I don't want to hurt anything. Sure, you get hurt playing basketball, but the goal of the game is not to tear someone to the ground. I'd like to mention that Pro is 14 according to his profile, she should know what I mean. Secondly I'd like to make it known that women wrestling is considered awful, even by pro people on a wrestling forum. Read what they say here: [1] Too physical means awkwardly weird and the sport is generally (and obviously) uncomfortable for everyone, the spectators and the players! [2], [3] R2. ""Additionally, Women Wrestling is actually quite popular. A YouTube video called, ""Top 10 Female Wrestlers,"" currently has over 17 million views and 23,000 likes! [1] Many people actually enjoy spectating female wrestling because it is fun and exciting. On the other hand, sewing has no intense rivalries and matches. Watching someone sew is clearly not exciting."" YouTubers say nothing on the scale of popularity. Admit it, whenever you watch a video you are either bored or have to do it for education (school). A YouTube video has no say in this debate because it doesn't prove that women wrestling is entertaining, in fact if anything, it proves against your proposition. It is lame and not useful in any way. R3. ""There are approximately 237,868 victims of sexual assaults, each year. [3] Female wrestling might actually decrease the amount of sexual assaults. If women were to learn wrestling, they would be capable of defending themselves from rapists."" I doubt that.

""Yes, men might earn a few dollars from stitching and selling their products. Don't forget that professional female wrestler would earn more money.

Wrestling is dumb because it just gives females in a better position in money, but is that good for anyone? All those people who pay to see lame performance of women wrestling and then they have less money! If men sewed more they would not only provide for themselves but it would give resources (clothing and accessories) to others.

Oooohh this just got serious! Thank you for your arguments, Pro.  
  
R1. ""My opponent claims that women wrestling would be ""lame to watch"" because they are ""done"" with physical activities. This is absolutely untrue. My opponent brings up a faulty claim without evidence. Growing mature wouldn't cause women to lose interest in physical activities. This is why professional female soccer players, tennis players, and wrestlers exist (these are only couple of examples). Women still have interest in sports. Women, like men, enjoy physical activities.""  
I am a woman too. I do a ton of physical activities (sports). But I am thirteen. I have not fully grown in my physical body futures!!! I play every sport (basketball, softball/baseball, tennis, volleyball, soccer) except wrestling (and boxing and Lecross). Main reason is because I don't want to hurt anything. Sure, you get hurt playing basketball, but the goal of the game is not to tear someone to the ground. I'd like to mention that Pro is 14 according to his profile, she should know what I mean. Secondly I'd like to make it known that women wrestling is considered awful, even by pro people on a wrestling forum. Read what they say here: [1] Too physical means awkwardly weird and the sport is generally (and obviously) uncomfortable for everyone, the spectators and the players! [2], [3]  
  
R2. ""Additionally, Women Wrestling is actually quite popular. A YouTube video called, ""Top 10 Female Wrestlers,"" currently has over 17 million views and 23,000 likes! [1] Many people actually enjoy spectating female wrestling because it is fun and exciting. On the other hand, sewing has no intense rivalries and matches. Watching someone sew is clearly not exciting.""  
YouTubers say nothing on the scale of popularity. Admit it, whenever you watch a video you are either bored or have to do it for education (school). A YouTube video has no say in this debate because it doesn't prove that women wrestling is entertaining, in fact if anything, it proves against your proposition. It is lame and not useful in any way.  
  
R3. ""There are approximately 237,868 victims of sexual assaults, each year. [3] Female wrestling might actually decrease the amount of sexual assaults. If women were to learn wrestling, they would be capable of defending themselves from rapists."" I doubt that. As you said, women have already started wrestling, but it is most definitely not the same as men's wrestling. There are better sports that could teach self defense, but wrestling would not do that well. Women should take Karate or something, instead!

Once Brittan had fallen and was under Nazi control then all Hitler had to do was build up his military bigger and all his resources and wait for the Japanese to finish up with the pacific, which brings me to my next point Pearl Harbor.

118,"CON Many economists argue that raising the minimum wage won't alleviate poverty and would shake an already fragile economy. We can raise the minimum wage to $11 but if no one chooses to hire people or hires fewer people then we have effectively raised unemployment. Alan Reynolds is a senior fellow with the Cato Institute and an expert on wage policy. He says that employers would likely chose to scale back jobs. Increasing the minimum wage could result in a lot of people who have been earning the minimum wage earning less than the minimum wage. How is that possible? Mall employers, farmers, lots of occupations are exempt from the minimum wage. So the last time we raised the minimum wage, lo and behold, the percentage earning less than the minimum wage rose to 4.2 percent of the wage and salary workers - three million. You basically have more people trying to compete for grape-picking jobs, or working in selling hot dogs in the street or day laborer or babysitting and that sort of thing. Fast food restaurants typically pay more than the minimum wage. When you talk minimum wage, it's really entry-level, and it's usually young people trying to get that first job. And if they do pretty well, three months, six months down the road, they get a little raise. That would effectively end if employers are starting people at $11. Actually there really aren't very many people who are working full time who are poor according to Reynolds. Maybe one percent. People are poor very often because they can't work for one reason or another. Disability, unemployment, so on and so forth. Obviously, doing something that will raise unemployment isn't going to help poverty. People who can't get work at 7.25 an hour aren't going to find work at 11.00 an hour. By such a dramatic jump they know there'd be a big hike in youth unemployment. The youth wouldn't get the experience they need to get the second job, which is a better job. And it's just basically a bad idea all the way around. To push the minimum wage to $11.00 at a time when the economy is facing high energy prices and rising inflation seems outrageous to me. I think it's probably a very bad idea to try to help the poor by raising prices. Liberal arguments for increasing the minimum wage have a fundamental flaw: They restrict the set of policy choices to either a minimum wage increase or doing nothing. That means they overlook the single most important federal policy for the poor: the Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC is a measure in the federal tax code to support the living standards of the poor without creating a ""welfare trap"" by diminishing the incentive to work. Economists widely consider the credit a success for reducing poverty while increasing employment. Created in 1975, the credit has been successively expanded in five times since. It is now the nation's largest anti-poverty transfer program. In its latest iteration, for families with two or more children, the credit is 40 percent of the first $10,750 of earned income. After earned income exceeds $15,040, the credit is phased out at a rate of 21.06 cents per marginal dollar, and it goes away fully at the point when earned income reaches $35,458.

UIL, athletic and other classes are not a part of this required curriculum, but electives that students may choose to take.  
  
Ultimately Pro has shown evidence detailing how US schools are in poor standing with other countries, but never doing away with extracurricular activities will solve this problem. On the other hand, I show that involvement in UIL readies kids for college as well as motives them to focus more on their studies.

While I'd be willing to admit that there are limits to a person's rights this does not essentially prove that gay marriage should be limited or prevented. One of the first lessons I learned in a law class is that ""a person is entitled to their rights as long as it does harm anyone else's rights."" What this means is you have the burden to prove that gay marriage harms other peoples' rights in order to warrant limitation or removal. Lets group that argument with the only offense you provide saying that the gay community is heavily inflitrated by drugs. First I would argue that even IF this was proven true, it has not harmed anyone but themselves. Second, it has nothing to do with why gays should be allowed to marry. And third, in the city of Los Angeles where that article was published, there is one of the highest crime rates in the nation. This means that any reliability from studies of crime would have a very large margin of error since it could not translate into smaller cities and towns. Now let me revisit the argument I provide saying that gay nieghborhood have a lower crime rate. The article I quoted had to deal with the West Village neighborhood, which is one of the largest gay communities in the nation next to San Fransico. It has reliable data because it surveyed 1920 people who lived in that area of Manhattan and the reported crime rate was extremely low.

It prevents civil unions, comprehensive domestic partnerships and removes existing legal benefits. There are about 360,000 unmarried couples in the state according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which there are roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples."" What this shows is that not only will the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment prevent gay and lesbian couples from having any form of legal union but also takes away and existing legal benefits they possess. The significance this argument has to this debate is that it shows that my opponent is providing a significant harm to the roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples in the state that could otherwise be avoided by voting no. Next, extend my second Nadine Smith argument which states, ""When Michigan took away domestic partnerships it didn't make married relationships any better, but what it did do is remove the benefits that gay couples had and made it alot harder for them to care for their families and the ones that they love.""

My opponent does not dispute that Israel has attempted peace several times in the past, thus conceding that it has. After the conflict over the Sinai territory in the 70's that Israel had taken, it offered Egypt the entire peninsula in exchange for peace. Egypt agreed, and peace was made. This is an astounding example of the measures that Israel will go to in order to keep peace between the nations[3]. 2. Con drops my point about the U.S. being a stabilizing force of peace through an alliance and instead tries to find two isolated actions of the IDF he finds ""unjust"". This is irrelevant as it ignores the bigger picture and has nothing to do with my actual argument. Con's Case Paramilitary groups 1. My adversary is supposed to be arguing that the status quo should be changed, as in the alliance should be cut, not that it should never have existed. Any points that he makes in support of the latter should be ignored as they are irrelevant to the resolution. Such points include militant groups that he suspects were formed because of America's support for Israel. 2. Con seems to be hinting that if the U.S. cut support with Israel then militant groups such as Al Qaeda would either die off or stop rising up against it. This is very far from the truth. If the U.S. cut its support, Israel would be rendered more vulnerable to terrorist groups such as Hamas and Al Qaeda, which is the exact opposite of what we want. Thus it is more logical for America to hold fast with Israel as it is set up for potential destruction. Cost This is actually quite minor of a point because it hinges on whether or not the alliance with Israel is worth keeping or not. If I can show that that the alliance is a net benefit, then a reader must agree that more lives saved is better than a few more dollars paid. This point doesn't really show how giving aid to another country is a bad thing unless we all assume that the alliance is pointless, which I have shown that it isn't. America's funding of Israeli military and the IDF is crucial for the protection and survival of its citizens.

Last night, at dinner my father slipped cyanide in my berry berry strawberrylitiouse drink. Not enough to kill me, just to hospitalize me. So anyway I take a drink of my super ungirly drink, and as I expect unconditional delitiosness to come flowing into my mouth, I instead start wrenching on the table. Foaming at the mouth, seizures, I mean the whole nine yards. And my father isn't the only one, when this happened, everyone at the table was laughing. Some of my brothers got on top of me while I was having a seizure, and pretended I was a bucking bull. Also what you said about 4 brothers is wrong. I have 17 1/2.

To have ones life be so unbelievably shittty, that he tries to kill his or her self, but no matter how HARD HE TRIES, HE CANT.  Here are my reasons why my life is more sucky than my opponents:  1. It's all a show     My father, the king, hates me. In public he makes it look like I have an amazing life, so no one will suspect. It's the perfect crime. However I suffer from severe child abuse. Last night, at dinner my father slipped cyanide in my berry berry strawberrylitiouse drink. Not enough to kill me, just to hospitalize me. So anyway I take a drink of my super ungirly drink, and as I expect unconditional delitiosness to come flowing into my mouth, I instead start wrenching on the table. Foaming at the mouth, seizures, I mean the whole nine yards. And my father isn't the only one, when this happened, everyone at the table was laughing. Some of my brothers got on top of me while I was having a seizure, and pretended I was a bucking bull. Also what you said about 4 brothers is wrong. I have 17 1/2.

134,"Thank you, Pro. My opponent struggles, in this round, to differentiate between the two meanings of the word ""must"". In the first contention, Pro suggests that John Gay's version of utilitarianism is not justified, and therefore does not prove the resolution false. This contends with the lack of an argument for utilitarianism which does recognize the happiness of animals. Pro simply never gives any proof for why utilitarianism which considers animal happiness is valid. Instead, all other arguments have been centered on whether or not utilitarianism which does not consider animals are self-consistent. John Gay's utilitarianism is entirely theologically based, and it is based on a from of Christianity. He simply did not have to prove the existence of his God or that his theory was true for the idea to be self-consistent. He was a utilitarian, and his brand of the normative ethics did not need to consider the happiness of animals. ""For example, he believed that ""beauty"" was an intrinsic good. A beautiful object had value independent of any pleasure it might generate in a viewer"" [1]. G.E Moore disagreed with the idea that beauty was subjective. The viewers of beauty, including animals, did not contribute to the ideal. This is another example of a self-consistent utilitarian ideology that does not need to consider the happiness of animals. What I suspect may be an argument for the brand of utilitarianism my opponent is suggesting, is the example of patriarchal views, My opponent suggests that since men learned to treat women as their equals, humans can learn to treat animals as our equals; thus my opponent suggests that women are to men as animals are to women. What this achieves, is to suggest that holding animal's happiness as less than animal's happiness is simply unjustified. My opponent gives no evidence for this idea, but the conclusion nonetheless remains irrelevant. The two brands of utilitarianism which I covered earlier do not become any less consistent with this assumption. Gay's reason for promoting human happiness was specifically due to his position on God's relationship to humankind. Moore's ideology promoted beauty completely independently from the pleasure that it caused. Pro's attempt to ""destroy"" my argument falls flat in more ways than one. The first being that beauty remains independent from happiness. The second being that it is an attempt to misconstrue the resolution. Utilitarianism ""must recognize animal's happiness"" in so far as its core beliefs are applied to animals. What the resolution suggests, is that the ""greatest happiness for the greatest number"" refers to the happiness of animals. Saying that the animals have an indirect role in that is not relevant. Consider my opponent's rule, as well as the rest of the debate so far: Semantic arguments are not allowed, and the entirety of the debate suggests that this argument is no more than that. Considering the happiness of animals clearly refers to accepting animals as a part of that greatest ""number"". I urge the floor to simply disregard this rebuttal. In conclusion, Utilitarianism does not need to take into account the happiness of animals. It is true that most varieties must, but the argument supporting the claim that all have to is borderline nonexistent.

So he has a right to live although he has lost the right to be free. Despite that, he deserves punishment and needs to be kept away from others because he is dangerous and jail does both. Finally it prevents future crime because people fear a life in prison, this is surely not as threatening as the death penalty but if a life in jail with lousy food and conditions, until death doesn't scare the potential criminals than I don't think death will either.

While I admit that there are many athletes of foreign nature respected in our country, this is not quite so with musicians, and there is a huge difference between both. A sport is a past-time, something we use for entertainment to excite ourselves. But music, is the gateway to the human soul. Through music we find our inner selves, and find what morals and aspects we have. Being one people in one nation, it only makes sense we would try to have the same ideas and thoughts. But these foreign musicians impose THEIR ideas upon us. This is slowly destroying our nation's values. Most would say that it is our values that made us great and keep us great. Without them, we are doomed. 2. He is attacking the Jonas Brothers. The opponent fails to recognize the fact that one person will often do what his or her friends do. So when one person starts liking Bieber everyone does. This forces millions of young girls everywhere to turn away from the J-Bros and to Bieber, completely unwillingly. 3. His voice is annoying. Seeing as there are 6,692,030,277 in the world and opponent stated that only 137,000 copies sold in the first week this means that only 1 person bought per every 49,000 people. Obviously a vast majority of people agree his voice is quite irritating. 4. He is destroying America's youth. The fact that other people are corrupting America does not make Justin Bieber any more in the right. You say he is tasting girls lip-gloss, and act as if this is O.K. So by this standard all pre-pubescent boys and girls are allowed to make out furiously all the time? It also imposes the idea on young women that they need to wear make-up to be appreciated by men.

145,"I would first like to thank my opponent for starting this debate and for his arguments. I will first respond to my opponent's contentions before responding to his rebuttals of my contentions. In my opponent's observations, my opponent states that China does not have the military capability to challenge the United States in the Pacific, so I cannot claim that the US considers China a threat. This is inaccurate as this is assuming that China would be engaging in a direct, militaristic conflict with the United States. This is also inaccurate as just because the US is the sole superpower on the planet does not mean there will be no one to challenge them. Keep in mind, the US was the sole superpower in 2001, and yet we faced the worst terrorist attack in the nation's history, causing us to go to war overseas for nearly ten years. My opponent's first contention states that China's cheap manufacturing increases quality of life. My opponent tags several sources, yet does not link to them, so I will ask my opponent to provide those links for a proper understanding of the points. Yet this does not address the numerous lost US jobs and decrease in wages [1], which definitely lowers the quality of life in the US drastically. While manipulation of the current yuan does result in cheaper goods for US consumers, Chinese currency manipulation is not only illegal [2] but it severely hurts US jobs and results in hundreds of billions of dollars lost [3]. This heavily outweighs the impact my opponent is trying to advance. My opponent's second contention states that China helps American companies. Again, this does not address the tremendous loss of jobs, decrease in wages as well as billions lost due to the trade deficit. My opponent states as well in this contention that China helps US companies by being a source of competition. My opponent does not specify as to how this helps US companies, so until he does provide some backing for this, this point must be ignored. That aside, rising competitiveness between the US and China might actually be dangerous, especially in technology [3]. My opponent's third contention states that China helps in trade, and he states several dollar amounts that trade with China raises with the US. However, this again does not address that China and the US are unbalanced when it comes to trade, resulting in tremendous job losses and numerous other economic faults, which outweigh any gained revenue. I will now proceed to address my opponent's rebuttals. My opponent's rebuttals to my first contention is that ""China is not stealing jobs as their rise will change their economy"", ""Jobs being shipped overseas is our own fault and we shouldn't expect jobs to come to us"", ""China's wages might be increasing, but this doesn't matter as US productivity will remain higher than China's"", ""US manufacturing is rising"" and ""These major companies are moving back to the US"". The first rebuttal does not address my contention, as it is assuming something in the future while we are addressing the current status of China. The second rebuttal does not address my contention either. As I've demonstrated, China's currency manipulation and trade inequity is resulting in the lost jobs, which is entirely the fault of China. The third rebuttal does not address the contention; even if productivity and incentives are factors, that does not resolve the massive loss in jobs and has not been seen being done heavily in practice. Again, my impact outweighs my opponent's points. The fourth rebuttal is unsatisfactory; even if US manufacturing is increasing, that does not resolve the fact that we have lost numerous jobs to China nor does it resolve those losses. The fifth rebuttal is also unsatisfactory; my opponent's two examples are just that, specific examples, and do not rebut the fact that China has cost us jobs nor does it recuperate those lost jobs. My first contention is still standing. My opponent's rebuttal to my second contention is simply ""China wouldn't do such a thing"". This is ignoring the fact that China is currently hurting the dollar right now; my second contention is not a theory or hypothesis, it's based on evidence of China's actions. China's actions point to them threatening the US dollar. My opponent's rebuttal does not apply and my contention remains standing. My opponent's rebuttals to my third contention are ""China wouldn't try to threaten the US"", ""China's military is complacent"", ""China's budget is less than the US"", ""China is reducing gasoline"", ""China has a green vehicle industry"" and ""China's weapons are vulnerable to U.S. cyber attacks"". My opponent's first two contentions are that ""China wouldn't try to threaten the US"", which is incorrect as we are seeing evidence of them threatening the US, contradicting my opponent's rebuttal. ""China's military is complacent"" is incorrect; China's military is dangerously growing [4] [5]. ""China's budget is less than the US"" does not address the contention; as long as the Chinese military threatens the US, this rebuttal falls. ""China is reducing gasoline"" and ""China has a green vehicle industry"" does not address the point made about Iran; as long as China is supporting Iran, which they are currently, these rebuttals fall. These rebuttals do not even address national security, which was the contention at hand. Finally, ""China's weapons are vulnerable to US cyber attacks"" does not address the contention either; as long as China's military technology threatens the US, which they do and which China has used recently, these rebuttals fall. This contention is still standing. For these reasons, I strongly urge a ballot in negation of the resolution. Sources: [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>...

147,"Thank you for providing definitions for the purpose of this debate. It is childish to create an organization to support weak arguments because you agree with them ideologically. In fitting with the Merriam-Webster definition, it certainly indicative of lacking poise. It also shows the immaturity of the individuals involved, unwilling to accept that they lost their debate simply by arguing poorly or choosing a poor argument to make, while being unable to support it. As far as being counter productive is considered, it depends on the goal of the user of Debate.org. Many come here to debate, and as you said rant. The Debates are then subject to what many would hope to be a relatively fair review by fellow users. So, for users who specifically hold this goal it is very counter productive. Individuals that are interested in belonging to a community online will also find voting blocs to be counter productive. The online community will suffer if individuals debating are left with a nasty taste in their mouths as the votes come in because they have been in a debate targeted by one voting bloc or another. This will naturally lead to hostility. While violence is certainly one way to create an unsafe environment, it is not the only way. With the use of the internet, there are many ways that a person can attack another without ever getting up from their key board. This could lead to a number of poor results, causing financial damage and emotional pain. There is also the possibility of terrible personal attacks being made that are completely unfounded. Having groups of debaters forming voting blocs and launching personal attacks at one another hardly sounds like ""fun"" to me. To have these personal attacks then supported by more talented users of technology with cyber attacks doesn't sound safe, although it could possibly add to the fun - but I doubt that's the kind of fun the creator of this website meant. My resolution still stands that voting blocs are childish and counter productive to create voting blocs to support weak arguments. I was not making a statement that all voting blocs are childish and counter productive, fore instance it might be quite beneficial to the community if a voting block was formed to support grammar or polite arguments. However, creating a voting block to support weak arguments because of an agreement with ideology, for an example, is childish and counter productive. The difficulty is, of course, the that inspired this debate dictated that you support the arguments ""If you agree with them."" It doesn't say to support the argument that was the strongest, just the person you agreed with. Voting for what you agree with is different than supporting the strongest argument. It is supporting the weak argument that will make fun and safety less apparent on this website.",1,Patrick_Henry,"
  
Thank you for providing definitions for the purpose of this debate.  
  
It is childish to create an organization to support weak arguments because you agree with them ideologically. In fitting with the Merriam-Webster definition, it certainly indicative of lacking poise. It also shows the immaturity of the individuals involved, unwilling to accept that they lost their debate simply by arguing poorly or choosing a poor argument to make, while being unable to support it.  
  
As far as being counter productive is considered, it depends on the goal of the user of Debate.org. Many come here to debate, and as you said rant. The Debates are then subject to what many would hope to be a relatively fair review by fellow users. So, for users who specifically hold this goal it is very counter productive.  
  
Individuals that are interested in belonging to a community online will also find voting blocs to be counter productive. The online community will suffer if individuals debating are left with a nasty taste in their mouths as the votes come in because they have been in a debate targeted by one voting bloc or another. This will naturally lead to hostility.

They provide an inaccurate look at the reality of what they are about because personal issues are thrown in to capture the audience. Nowadays, people do want to learn, but they want to learn with something that can catch their attention. By adding in drama going on with the characters themselves, people continue to watch, and still are learning about the topic of that show. TLC is probably well aware that shows like Honey Boo do not provide the greatest message, but they have an audience who may not only care for the family's personal problems, but being in pageants. The family of Honey Boo Boo is not particularly rich, and there are probably viewers who want to learn about how to save/bargain if they have children who want to be in beauty pageants. Honey Boo Boo aside, TLC aims to please their viewers. If they have the money from people watching their ""not so great shows"", they can put it towards more educational television. The reality shows they offer are basically there to get viewers, keep them entertained, and get money. With money, comes new ideas for more educational programming. As for future generations, they could still watch and learn something from TLC's programs. It is just up to the parent or guardians to keep those children aware of what is right, what is wrong, and to form their own ideas of what they watch. TLC still should be considered ""The Learning Channel"" because their shows are educational, it is just that the shows are focused on expanding the views and attention spans of their audience.",1,MaddietheOpinionated,"

Immigration Arguments : Gifted and Talented : Within any given background, 99% of the time there is at least one student who wishes to excel within their studies and the amount of work given to them during class is simply not enough. The education within any average school in NSW is not enough for a student to receive their maximum potential in life. Many students believe that they lack enough education just within the school and therefore seek for further learning material outside of school. They spend money on other materials to aid them in their education outside of school. This can either be done because they are falling behind or simply because they wish to study more for a better job. The same thing can be applied to those students outside of NSW who are not receiving the same level of education at their school. If they believe that they are not learning enough within their own school, they themselves re able to do something about it. Some options include going some extensive coaching, studying more online or simply buying the books neccesarry for their learning. We humans are smart enough to know whether we wish to study more or not. Those with LEARNING DISSABILITIES : Pro's resolution clearly was "" that Australian education should be same throughout the nation"". He therefore implies that the education for EVERY STUDENT within Australia must be the same. This is proven as a very unreasonable as there are those who have learning disabilities within specific schools in Australia. These disabilities make creates difficulties for those students to learn, and therefore will not be able to progress at the same rate as required by the education provided by the government. Some of these disabilities that can be taken note of include: 1. Those who are visually impaired 2. Those with ADHD 3. Those who are audibly impaired. Just to name a few. By trying to create the same education system for all the students in Australia, those with learning difficulties can create a big gap between those without. In schools with students who suffer from learning difficulties, they are given a much less demanding workload for obvious reasons. It will illogical to change the education system for ""the good of the nation"" as claimed by pro in his first argument. English as a SECOND LANGUAGE : There are a lot of students in Australia who study English as their second language. The main reason is because their family migrated from a different country and decided to live in Australia. Those from Asian countries are a common example. The point that I am trying to make is that those who are learning English as their second language should not be disadvantaged by being forced to be put into the same education as those who have English as their first tongue. This will not only create major difficulties in their studies of English, but also create difficulties to understand the material being taught during class. This is commonly why most school in Australia (Primary school, Middle school and High School) have an ""ESL"" (English as Second Language) unit for students who are newly migrated to Australia. It provides them a more comfortable setting and allows them to study at a more reasonable/suitable pace for their level of education. The implementation of this ""one education system"" for all students currently in Australia will not be a reasonable option. CONCLUSION : The disadvantages of creating an ""education system that is the same throughout the nation"" clearly outweighs the advantages. One must take into concern that it will affect the studies of those who having learning difficulties and those who have English as their second tongue. Educated readers may also note that uniting the education system in Australia as one will benefit none of those students who are naturally gifted and talented.

These disabilities make creates difficulties for those students to learn, and therefore will not be able to progress at the same rate as required by the education provided by the government. Some of these disabilities that can be taken note of include:  1. Those who are visually impaired   2. Those with ADHD  3. Those who are audibly impaired.   Just to name a few.   By trying to create the same education system for all the students in Australia, those with learning difficulties can create a big gap between those without. In schools with students who suffer from learning difficulties, they are given a much less demanding workload for obvious reasons. It will illogical to change the education system for ""the good of the nation"" as claimed by pro in his first argument.   English as a SECOND LANGUAGE  :  There are a lot of students in Australia who study English as their second language. The main reason is because their family migrated from a different country and decided to live in Australia. Those from Asian countries are a common example.   The point that I am trying to make is that those who are learning English as their second language should not be disadvantaged by being forced to be put into the same education as those who have English as their first tongue. This will not only create major difficulties in their studies of English, but also create difficulties to understand the material being taught during class.   This is commonly why most school in Australia (Primary school, Middle school and High School) have an ""ESL"" (English as Second Language) unit for students who are newly migrated to Australia. It provides them a more comfortable setting and allows them to study at a more reasonable/suitable pace for their level of education.   The implementation of this ""one education system"" for all students currently in Australia will not be a reasonable option.   CONCLUSION  :  The disadvantages of creating an ""education system that is the same throughout the nation"" clearly outweighs the advantages. One must take into concern that it will affect the studies of those who having learning difficulties and those who have English as their second tongue. Educated readers may also note that uniting the education system in Australia as one will benefit none of those students who are naturally gifted and talented.   It is now up to Pro to prove to use why implementing this ""one education"" system for the entire nation will actually be beneficial.   Onto pro to make his second argument...",Education,0,The-Australian-education-system-should-united-and-be-the-same-level-as-the-Nsw-education-system/1/,57420

166,"I want to thank Pro for his final round and will now begin with my closing rebuttals. Arguments/Rebuttals I. ""Is run by"" = ""Is owned by"" In this line of argumentation I expanded on who really owns MTV, a multi-national media company called Viacom. The man who runs the MTV portion of Viacom is Tom Freston, as shown in my previous round. I stated in the last round that for Pro's premise to be considered valid he would need to present proof of Tom Freston being a Freemason. In response, Pro said the following: ""They would be secret Freemasons. I obviously can't give proof for that, but It's an assumption based off of the other points I made."" This is the problem... Pro said, ""it's an assumption"". Unfortunately, that is not enough to affirm Pro's position. Pro needs to uphold the BOP (Burden of Proof), which is the obligation to prove one's assertion. Without such proof, there is no reason to accept Pro's assumptions as valid. In short, assumptions are unfortunately not enough to uphold the burden of proof that is needed to affirm Pro's position. Additionally, pictures of a Masonic temple or celebrities on MTV add nothing to the claim that MTV is owned by Freemasons. What Pro needed to do to uphold his burden was provide sound proof to validate his assumptions. That could have come in the form of Tom Freston wearing a Masonic ring in a picture, perhaps a Masonic logo on his vehicle, or a picture of him attending a Masonic lodge. Unfortunately for Pro, no such evidence was given, thus there is absolutely no reason to *assume* that he is a Freemason. I could claim that Brittney spears is a Freemason too, but without proof there is no reason to accept such a claim as a valid one. Hence this line of argumentation remains standing while Pro's assumptions stand defeated due to a lack of valid proof. II. ""One of the MTV headquarters is in/by a Masonic Temple."" Pro offered no rebuttal for this line of argumentation. Thus I extend it as it remains standing unchallenged by Pro. Pro's initial claim was that one of MTV's offices are located in a building that once served as a Masonic temple, thus MTV is run by Freemasons. However, if you look at the Wikipedia page for that specific building, it shows a CTV sign. [1] The article goes on to say that before the building was purchased by CTV, ""it housed live music clubs known as the Concert Hall."" In addition to the previous owners not being Freemasons, MTV itself decided to move its office to another location in the city and sold the building to an IT-firm on June 17, 2013. So... the building isn't even occupied by MTV anymore. [2] [3] With it shown that the building itself has been under numerous owners, there is no reason to assume that just because MTV happened to be one of many occupants during it's history that MTV is run by Freemasons. Lastly, during the sale of the building from MTV to an IT-firm, the local Freemasons attempted to reclaim the building for themselves. [4] This raises the question as to why they'd want to reclaim the building for themselves if they technically own/run it themselves. It just doesn't make sense. The evidence is clear, the fact that MTV *temporarily* occupied the building holds no weight for the claim that Pro tried making by saying that ""because they are located in a Masonic temple = they are run by Freemasons"". This line of argumentation from Pro stands defeated. III. ""Part of MTV's Video Music Awards on the left side of the picture, and a Masonic ritual on the right"" Ah, I just noticed the 2nd picture Pro shared which shows the Masonic symbol with the words ""concert hall"" right above it on the brick interior wall. This makes perfect sense though since the Masonic temple became the ""concert hall"" after the masons moved out. The mimicry of the celebrities in the MTV awards picture in regards to the Masonic ritual of being tied with a noose while blindfolded and tied hands does nothing to affirm that MTV is run by Freemasons. That ritual is highly sacred, and if MTV WAS owned by Freemasons, they'd never allow non-masons to mimic such rituals publicly, especially if the celebrity is uninitiated. Furthermore, the celebrity in the image wasn't even mimicking the ritual in full. There was no noose, nor was the celebrity wearing the white-clothes which is a key part of the ritual. To the untrained eye, it really does look very similar. To the trained eye though, it's clear that it is far from the actual ritual, as well as the fact that a Mason would never allow a celebrity to mimic such a sacred ritual publicly. If anything, it is merely the script-writers and production teams for the show leeching off the latest fad of illuminati nonsense. It's easy to appear as if you are involved in Masonry, especially to the dumbed-down public which knows nothing of Masonic rituals unless they themselves have visited a temple and partook in the rituals themselves. Thus, these images do nothing in terms of providing substantial evidence in Pro's attempt of affirming the resolution. All they reflect are modern television shows (which is what the awards are) hopping on the illuminati bandwagon to increase viewer retention and rates due to the intriguing nature that surrounds such things as 'secret societies'. In closing, Pro dropped a major argument. Pro also failed to provide any substantial evidence and reasoning to show that MTV is run by Freemasons. On the flip side, I've provided rebuttals to each line of argumentation while utilizing valid evidence and sources. With Pro's lack of substantial evidence and arguments which were based solely on assumptions, I believe the resolution stands negated. I want to thank Pro for this invigorating debate, and look forward to any and all challenges in the future! Sources [1] <URL>... (Toronto) [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>...

[1] The article goes on to say that before the building was purchased by CTV, ""it housed live music clubs known as the Concert Hall.""   In addition to the previous owners not being Freemasons, MTV itself decided to move its office to another location in the city and sold the building to an IT-firm on June 17, 2013. So... the building isn't even occupied by MTV anymore. [2] [3]   With it shown that the building itself has been under numerous owners, there is no reason to assume that just because MTV happened to be one of many occupants during it's history that MTV is run by Freemasons.   Lastly, during the sale of the building from MTV to an IT-firm, the local Freemasons attempted to reclaim the building for themselves. [4] This raises the question as to why they'd want to reclaim the building for themselves if they technically own/run it themselves. It just doesn't make sense.   The evidence is clear, the fact that MTV *temporarily* occupied the building holds no weight for the claim that Pro tried making by saying that ""because they are located in a Masonic temple = they are run by Freemasons"". This line of argumentation from Pro stands defeated.   III. ""Part of MTV's Video Music Awards on the left side of the picture, and a Masonic ritual on the right""  Ah, I just noticed the 2nd picture Pro shared which shows the Masonic symbol with the words ""concert hall"" right above it on the brick interior wall. This makes perfect sense though since the Masonic temple became the ""concert hall"" after the masons moved out.   The mimicry of the celebrities in the MTV awards picture in regards to the Masonic ritual of being tied with a noose while blindfolded and tied hands does nothing to affirm that MTV is run by Freemasons. That ritual is highly sacred, and if MTV WAS owned by Freemasons, they'd never allow non-masons to mimic such rituals publicly, especially if the celebrity is uninitiated. Furthermore, the celebrity in the image wasn't even mimicking the ritual in full. There was no noose, nor was the celebrity wearing the white-clothes which is a key part of the ritual.   To the untrained eye, it really does look very similar.   To the trained eye though, it's clear that it is far from the actual ritual, as well as the fact that a Mason would never allow a celebrity to mimic such a sacred ritual publicly.  If anything, it is merely the script-writers and production teams for the show leeching off the latest fad of illuminati nonsense. It's easy to appear as if you are involved in Masonry, especially to the dumbed-down public which knows nothing of Masonic rituals unless they themselves have visited a temple and partook in the rituals themselves.   Thus, these images do nothing in terms of providing substantial evidence in Pro's attempt of affirming the resolution. All they reflect are modern television shows (which is what the awards are) hopping on the illuminati bandwagon to increase viewer retention and rates due to the intriguing nature that surrounds such things as 'secret societies'.   In closing,   Pro dropped a major argument. Pro also failed to provide any substantial evidence and reasoning to show that MTV is run by Freemasons. On the flip side, I've provided rebuttals to each line of argumentation while utilizing valid evidence and sources. With Pro's lack of substantial evidence and arguments which were based solely on assumptions, I believe the resolution stands negated.   I want to thank Pro for this invigorating debate, and look forward to any and all challenges in the future!   Sources  [1]   http://en.wikipedia.org...  (Toronto)  [2]   http://www.blogto.com...

173,"As there are no questions regarding definitions, I shall assume they are all accepted. Firstly, I wish to mention there are no known non-biblical references to a historical Jesus by any writer of the time during and after Jesus's purported existence. In the words of Barbara Walker: ""No literate person of his own time mentioned him in any known writing."" Jewish philosopher Judaeus of Alexandria, alive at the proposed time of Jesus, the wealthiest and best connected citizens of the Empire, says nothing of Christ in his voluminous writings. Nor do any of the many historians and writers who flourished during the first one to two centuries of the era, and even then, nothing comes up until the time of Iraenius. Secondly, in the words of Justin Martyr: And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was produced without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. This shows again something that one needs to look at. The Biblical idea of Jesus Christ comes up in most people mind at the date 0 AD (the inexistence of the date is irrelevant). However, the canon source of the Bible is what is of importance. The Bible, written in 325 AD by the First Council of Nicaea[1]. The Greeks The first place to start will be the greeks. They are an old group (older than Christianity at least) and hold many stories which closely link to that of Christianity. Also, due to the geographic proximity, it is highly likely that these two groups had a lot of contact with each other. In fact, it is almost certain: both places being part of the Roman Empire before the first council of Nicaea, after all, made their link almost definite. Homer's work has also been found in the area, as well as references to Aeschylus, so the correlation is very likely to have existed. The character I wish to recognise first is Prometheus. Prometheus is is a Titan, a champion of mankind, known for his wily intelligence, who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to mortals. (or mankind had fire, Zeus took it away, then Prometheus gave it back). Zeus then crucified him, but forgave the sins of man. Firstly, Prometheus descended from heaven as a deitious being in order to give mankind fire and was punished for doing so by Zeus. Jesus descended from heaven as a deitious being in order to give mankind New Rules and was punished for doing so by the community. The community then crucified him, but forgave the sins of man. The main clashes here are obvious: Jesus/Prometheus' descendence from heaven, descended as a deitious being, the fire/new rules and the giver of the punishment. The first requires my opponent to prove that there is a difference[2]. This is also true of the second[2]. The third and the fourth require more allegorical interpretation - that is not to say more forced interpretetation, but simply not taking the phrase ""fire"" as meaning a literal burning stick of wood. Fire was allegorical, as were many things in the play, but the fire was one that was an ""obvious and transparent symbol""[3]. The fire, according to sparknotes, represents the gift of artistic and technological advancement, however the limiting scope to these two things is undesirable: Vellacott and many other literary scholars[4] put forth that it is complete growth in all aspects, a spiritual and philosophical growth as well as all others, and that limitting it to just science is ungrounded. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the fire was a growth done to increase humanity and human understanding. Now, the comparison to Jesus in this way is very clear. Jesus being the light to illuminate us all[5] is clear, and Jesus being known as the truth is obvious as well[6]. Regarding the crucifixion, the chaining to the 'stone' is well known as being similar: Dr. Martin Hengel remarks: When describing how his hero is fastened to two rocks in the Caucasus, Lucian uses all the technical terms of a crucifixion: Prometheus is to be nailed to two rocks above a ravine in the sight of all, in such a way as to produce the effect of ""a most serviceable cross"" Simone Weil uses the word ""crucifies"" to describe specifically the event that happened with both Prometheus and Jesus.[7] There are many people who see this correlation, and it is not one that is rare. There is a massive correlation between these two ideas. I shall present other correlations in my future post, and await a rebuttal.

174,"My opponent misunderstands; by pointing out the gap in time between Yoda's prime and Luke's, I am not saying the fight could not take place. This is a hypothetical duel, after all. All I was trying to say was, the Yoda you see in the movies was old and dying, and - compared to when he was in his prime - slow and weak. He still beat the tar out of Palpatine. ""I also want to point out the fact that Yoda uses Ataru not Soresu."" A typo. The validity of the argument is unaffected; and I did say it was form IV, which was correct.

His preferred form has advantages which cancel out Luke's greater reach and aggression. My opponent has failed to answer almost all of the arguments from last round, including: - My comparison of Luke and Yoda using Palpatine as a benchmark, - My defence of the experience point (Yoda has been far more duels than Luke, and against greater opponents; this gives him an edge in our duel), - My defence of the knowledge point (since Luke never mastered ALL of the lightsaber forms, Yoda will be able to pull tricks out of his sleeve that Luke won't expect.) - The fact that Yoda knows and can use many more Force techniques than Luke.

Yoda is called by the wiki ""one of the most skilled users of the Force in the history of the galaxy."" He lived for 900 years during the golden age of the Jedi, and had time to learn every Force technique. He was Windu's first teacher, and was present for his training and career; he is not a strange to Shatterpoint, as he was the mentor of the most famous Shatterpoint-user. There are relatively few stories about Yoda, as Lucas wanted to keep him something of a mystery. There are many stories about Luke, of course; but most of them have to do with him learning Force techniques that were lost in the Purge - techniques that Yoda taught in the Jedi Temple. There is no way for me to exhaustively list all of the Force techniques Yoda knew. No doubt, most of them aren't even recorded. Luke's force lightning will be used against him by Yoda, who can re-direct it back at him. If he calls up a force storm, there's no reason why Yoda cannot do the same, or redirect it back at him. A few examples of Yoda's Force abilities: - he mastered Force Valour, which renders the user almost invisible; - he turned off Ventress's lightsabers while they were still in her hands, and took them away using the Force; - precognition, an ability he was noted for before the Sith clouded the Force. When he is listed as one of the most skilled masters of the Force to have ever lived, I expect that statement to speak for itself. If there is a way to use the power of the Force, it is a safe guess that Yoda can use it. I now return the debate to my opponent, and ask him to address my arguments.

My opponent misunderstands; by pointing out the gap in time between Yoda's prime and Luke's, I am not saying the fight could not take place. This is a hypothetical duel, after all. All I was trying to say was, the Yoda you see in the movies was old and dying, and - compared to when he was in his prime - slow and weak. He still beat the tar out of Palpatine.  
  
""I also want to point out the fact that Yoda uses Ataru not Soresu.""  
A typo. The validity of the argument is unaffected; and I did say it was form IV, which was correct. The point was Yoda's greater mastery of the lightsaber, since he had mastered ALL of the forms (including soresu, incidentally) and was capable of using any of them. His preferred form has advantages which cancel out Luke's greater reach and aggression.

In operation north woods parts of the government tried to get Kennedy to help stage a cuban attack on Florida so America could blame the communists and invade Cuba. Our government had done this stuff before so I find it very annoying when people like the amazing atheist think it's crazy to believe that our government will do it again. 1. Wolfgang Halbig is a national school safety consultant. He spent many years as a Florida state trooper and almost 25 years as a national school safety consultant. He was present at the columbine shooting. He has been to every state and helped train people how to keep schools safe. When sandy hook first Happened he donated money. He offered to help analyze the event. He than began to realize that there were many strange things about the official story. He began asking questions. The questions were not offensive. He wanted to know who declared the victims legally dead, who installed the security cameras, who ordered the porta poddys to the seen, who didn't let the EMTs in to the school ect. After about 10 months two plain clothes cops came to his house and told him bad stuff would happen if he didn't stop asking questions. Why would they try so hard to get him to stop asking basic questions? Why would they not answer the questions? They were not offensive and they were very easy. Than 2 months later he was visited by fbi officials who told him he was being charged with harassment. He didn't harass anyone. He asked basic questions. They asked him if he owned a gun and threatened him again. The lutenant of Newtown tried to shut him up to. He was being threatened for practicing his first amendment right. Here we have a situation where 20 children are injured and may be clinging to life. When the situation was nutralized they still didn't let EMTs in to the building. They didn't request trauma helicopters. The lutenant came to the seen two hours after it began. A kindergarten boy was told to wait in the room where the dead body's were until the seat guys got back. Meanwhile someone ordered porta podys to be sent in. Your worries about the porta posies but not the trauma helicopters? The cops parked 1/4 a mike away. The victims were declared dead in 11 minutes. Who declared them dead? Connecticut law says only a doctor can do that. On dr oz there was a little boy who said they were having a drill while explaining his view of what happened to dr oz. I would like to mention how Robbie Parker tells us exactly my how to donate money to him. After his child was killed he's thinking about money?. 27 million dollars were collected in donations for Newtown. Most of the victims families got free houses on December 25 2009 (Connecticut online data base) the cops were given a big check by Eric holder, each family got 281,000 from the state. Chris menfrodenia claimed he was on his way to make gingerbread houses with his daughters class room...I camo pants and a black jacket? Kathy gaubert is a women from Georgia. A picture of her daughter lily gaubert was taken off her Instagram and used was Allison Wyatt. It was even used on professional official sandy hook sites. Kathy finally pointed out that her daughter lives in Georgia and does not attend sandy hook. We've never seen or heard from Allison's parents. In the video of the Parker family that amazing atheist has Samantha and Madeline don't have legs. Why did they photoshop this picture. Adam Lanza was autistic. People with autism have poor motor skills. He was also 110 pounds soaking wet. He couldn't have physically carried 40 pounds of military equipment in the school and shot 26 people in 5-7 minutes with out any help. He had limited training as well.

I must only determine that at least ONE of the above phrases are not a pun to disprove him. For this, I will choose the phrase: ""...you can't have your kayak and heat it too."" Now I realize the intended pun in this situation. It is arguing that this phrase sounds like, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" However, according to my opponents preferred definition of a pun, it is clearly not. As clearly defined by my opponent, a pun is play on words either by interchanging different senses/definition/interpretations of a same word, or else a similar sense/definition/interpretation and sound of a different word. The words 'kayak' and 'cake' do not share either of these similarities. Kayak is pronounced kaiak (according to <URL>... ) and does not have any different sense other than: an Eskimo canoe made of a frame covered with skins except for a small opening in the center and propelled by a double-bladed paddle (according to <URL>... ). Therefore, it does not meet the first said qualifier of a pun. The arguable qualifier for this word, kayak, as a pun, would be that it shares the the similar sense/definition of the word 'cake' by linking it via a similar sound. However, the only similarity here between the two sounds is the beginning sounds of 'kuh' and the ending sounds of 'kuh'. This is HARDLY enough evidence to prove that ""...you can't have your kayak and heat it too"" is a pun. Please bear with me as I give an example: Two men sit on a bench. They both watch by-passers walk by until one passing man falls to the ground and dies. They both look at the man on the ground until one says, ""Thats the third time today."" ""Yep,"" the other agrees. ""They're just dropping like floss."" Now if you think a long time about this scenario, you realize that its not funny. The joke is obviously intended to compare ""dropping like flies"" to ""dropping like floss"", but the word floss isn't at ALL related to the story at all. This is the same as my opponent's phrase. Both share the similar beginning sounds (kuh and kuh in kayak as to the kuh and kuh in cake AS does the fuh and seh in flies compare to the fuh and seh in floss) but neither are funny or related and neither can be considered puns. Now say that, perhaps, my story was revised to that the men falling down dead were dentists. Then MAYBE it could be considered a pun because of the facetious relationship between the vaguely similar words and the subject. HOWEVER, my opponent's ""pun"" has no such link between his random words and the story. IF the words kayak and cake shared a similar middle sound as well as the beginning and ending similarities, then the pun argument might have some bearing. However, they do not. To strengthen my argument, I will state that there is only one pronunciation of kayak as cited in these numerous sites: <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Unless my opponent has found the pun somewhere else in the phrase debated, of which I am glad to listen to, my conjecture is inarguably correct. To summarize my points: 1. I need only to disprove one of my opponent's ""puns"" to disprove his contention 2. Kayak and cake haven't enough sound similarity to be considered a pun 3. There is no loop hole around the pronunciation of ""kayak"" 4.

189,"I wholesomely thank the pro side for presenting their arguments in a clear and concise manner. I shall be rebutting them one by one, and of course, I'll be putting my sources at the end of the post. Ladies and gentlemen, let us proceed: Pro argues by saying that the death penalty offers social benifits; the first one being peace of mind. I agree that the possibility of a prisoner escaping exists, but statistics show that the odds of that happening are extremely low (1). ' 6,530 people escaped or were AWOL from state prisons. That was a littlemore than one-half of 1 percent of the total population of 1,100,224 state prisoners.' It doesn't end there. Most of these ""breakouts"" are usually recovered. In average, 10000 escapees result in 9000 of these recovered within the same year (1). And that was statistical data from 1998 . As for the present? It should be known that prison escapes are declining due to technology breakthrough (2): As it is seen from this chart, there's in average FOUR escapes per TEN THOUSAND PRISONER (2013 data). That's a number so low, that the chances of being attacked by a prisoner that has escaped from detention are nigh ZERO (You may find the full chart with detailed numbers in the source ndeg2). Now the question to ask is whether it is worth it to apply the death sentence when the rist of prison breakthroughs is so low. I will give my based opinion WHILE rebutting the rest of his aruguments. The second argument provided is a classic. Ah, the theory of ""example"". Pro states that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for potentional criminals, and as an example to murderers. I completely and categorically disagree with that notion, and I will state why: Far, far from scaring away criminals and deterring murderers, the death penalty desensitizes the masses to death, and I have many anecdotal evidences, as well as scientifical and statistical evidence to prove that (more on that later). Not only that, but the ""example theory"" makes no sense whatsoever seeing how the death penalty is currently organized. If you really want the death penalty to be ""deterring"", it has to be seen by the masses. Bring back the medieval age, Farinacci, tormentors, dismembrements, public torching, yada yada; it is a requirement to make the theory work. But in the US and other countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty... you miserably behead or hang a poor man in a deserted boulevard with no one passing, no witnesses (aside from the family of the victim). As for the evidence, let us look at a countries that practiced the death penalty, and how that practice has inevitably contributed to desensitize the masses: France. Not only did the death penalty not reduce the crime rates compared to its neighbour countries that did abolish it, but it resulted in extremely barbaric scenes due to to the desensitization of the masses. Victor Hugo, a french poet and the lead of the romantic scene, gave us a lot of temoinages of his time, alongside some other authors as well. 1832, 5 mars, during the execution of Louis Camus, the public who assisted (because capital punishment was public at the time) swayed towards the guilottine and started dancing around the headless body, and some were said to be ""playing football"" with the head. And that's only one temoinage, as he has left countless more as well. Bottom line, everytime there was a public capital execution, the people of France feisted, sold places to assist as if it was the country circus, dansed around the guillotine, et cetera (3). ALSO; The scientific conclusion is clear. The death penalty does not deter homicide . No study has ever found a deterrent effect, no matter how skewed the research question was in favor the death penalty. Pro has failed to abide by the burden of proof because on study has found any connection whatsoever between decreasing criminality rates and the death penalty. I challenge Pro to prove me otherwise. Actually, studies suggest the exact contrary! The brutalization effect suggests that when violence is condoned via the death penalty, more violence occurs. Homicide rates tend to increase around the time of executions, due to legitimation, desensitization, and imitation. The death penalty makes society more dangerous by further increasing violence through the brutalization effect (4). As for the cost arguments, I must say that Pro is flat out wrong. The death penalty is quite expensive and life imprisonment can be cheaper (5). Over the lifetime of a case, executing prisoners can be three times as expensive as life in prison, primarily due to the higher costs of capital punishment trials, automatic appeals, and the heightened security on death row with lower staff-to-prisoner ratios. Commuting all death sentences to life in prison would save hundreds of millions of dollars per year in the U.S. and many billions over the coming decades. sources are here: <URL>...",1,Lilieze,"

Pro has failed to abide by the burden of proof because on study has found any connection whatsoever between decreasing criminality rates and the death penalty.   I challenge Pro to prove me otherwise.  Actually, studies suggest the exact contrary!   The brutalization effect suggests that when violence is condoned via the death penalty, more violence occurs. Homicide rates tend to increase around the time of executions, due to legitimation, desensitization, and imitation. The death penalty makes society more dangerous by further increasing violence through the brutalization effect (4).  As for the cost arguments, I must say that Pro is flat out wrong.   The death penalty is quite expensive and life imprisonment can be cheaper (5). Over the lifetime of a case, executing prisoners can be three times as expensive as life in prison, primarily due to the higher costs of capital punishment trials, automatic appeals, and the heightened security on death row with lower staff-to-prisoner ratios. Commuting all death sentences to life in prison would save hundreds of millions of dollars per year in the U.S. and many billions over the coming decades.  sources are here:   https://pastebin.com...",Society,1,Some-crimes-should-be-punishable-by-death-as-long-as-a-much-higher-standard-of-proof-is-upheld./1/,54927

If 9 or less cases are pointed out by PRO and stand, CON wins. I have won contentions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. That is 6/10 legitimate arguments. Since 4 cases were demonstrated by Pro to be in his favor, and 4 is less than 9, Pro has lost by the terms of the debate, and has lost even if this generous burden of proof was not present.

This is a debate, you can't have a proxy fill in for you.   2)   Also,   new arguments brought up in the last round do not count  . Therefore, I will not address the sliming arguments you have brought up which include the 24 other points you have brought up and not described how they were lies, nor would the random sound bytes legitimately impune Romney.  3)   Also, you can't post a link to a website you did not write and try to pass that off as your own argument.   A link is not an argument.  Conclusion  According to the setup of the debate, I have won by a clear margin. At the beginning of the debate, this was the setup:   CON: Has to rebut PRO. If 9 or less cases are pointed out by PRO and stand, CON wins.   I have won contentions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. That is 6/10 legitimate arguments. Since 4 cases were demonstrated by Pro to be in his favor, and 4 is less than 9, Pro has lost by the terms of the debate, and has lost even if this generous burden of proof was not present.   I have won this debate conclusively on the agreed grounds.

Therefore in the second round you state the issue of cyber-bullying and suicidal attempts which is a way to release hatred. Now we all know that kids cannot bare insults at a small age. Yes, we are aware of that. Now first thing is ""Why cyber-bullying occurs?"" The main reason being ""Jealousy towards someone else"" and this is where small kids tend to suppress and dominate others just to be better than them because they know that they are NOT. Now what are the solutions to ""Cyber-bullying?"" In one way, the kid who is bullying others must be constantly warned and monitored by his elders. If he does not come to terms than action must be taken ethically and make him realize his mistakes. THIS IS HOW THEIR MINDS WILL DEVELOP IN THE FIRST PLACE if we talk about maturity. However, Social media cannot stop people posting their opinions but they still have a way. AND THEY STILL TAKE A STAND AGAINST CYBER BULLYING AND THEY ARE NOT SITING QUITE ABOUT THIS! They have made a ""blocking option."" They have made a ""report this user"" option. They have a ""mute option"" They have a ""ban option"" What else do you expect Social Media to do? People will be like ""He is bullying me SO I will suicide and give up my life. I HATE FACEBOOK"" Well newsflash for you ""FACEBOOK HAS THESE ABOVE OPTIONS. WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THEM HUH?"" Stop blaming social media. So, please don't say that cyber-bullying is because social media exists. Cyber-bullying exists BECAUSE BAD PEOPLE EXIST. If not cyber-bullying, we have Rapes, harassment, robbery, murder, stealing lunch etc etc. What about that?^^ No matter where you go you will find BULLYING in one way or the other. THIS IS BECAUSE OF BAD PEOPLE FOLKS! Tomorrow, if some murders with a KNIFE. WHO WILL YOU BLAME? The Knife? Or The one who USED THE KNIFE? So you see, knife is a tool to serve your purpose, but the way you USE knife is totally up to you. And let me make this clear, THERE IS NO STOP TO BULLYING IN ANY MANNER. Bullying does stop at cyber-bullying. If you look at the Obama's speech against Trump, the way he made a mockery out of him (DO NOT VOTE TRUMP!!!) this means I will BLAME the MIC and not OBAMA because MIC is a tool. Or if you see trump's speech where he throws out Muslims. THIS IS ALSO BULLYING where I will blame the mic and not TRUMP!! That's just RIDICULOUS. So why differentiate with Social Media? Even Social media is a tool, like mic or knife. Moreover, if a kid is facing cyber bullying, it is clearly understood by his behavior and facial expressions that ""Something is not right."" and they are vulnerable to THREATS. Which is what parents must understand and THIS is where they must interfere. But being stupid they DON'T and let their kid go through that and then regret. This is again the PARENTS to blame. Even the kids who are not mature, need help. We understand. This is why PARENTS have to take the step. DO NOT BLAME SOCIAL MEDIA for someone else's mistake. I repeat. The girl who killed herself is utterly stupid. She was looking for attention and when she found herself being humiliated for what she did, she starts to blame FACEBOOK. However, Social Media is now keeping a check of all accounts whether you know it or not to act against cyber-bullying and hacking. If they find any suspicious activity, they WILL take action against it. My point being that The AGE must be lowered to 10 so that every one has equal access and rights but they have to be monitored. All these technologies that we humans created, are all tools. Now that everything that depends on is HOW we use it. Humans just don't want to blame themselves so they look forward to blaming tools regardless of their ages. Social Media is a BOON in this era which everyone should utilize it. Please do not snatch this BOON from small children. Let them experience this BOON but at the same time take care of them. Let me tell you this, We have worked hard enough to achieve what we have today. So respect what we made. Respect our INVENTIONS. Don't blame our technology or tools. Blame the ONES who MISUSE THEM.",1,brainFreeze,"

AND THEY STILL TAKE A STAND AGAINST CYBER BULLYING AND THEY ARE NOT SITING QUITE ABOUT THIS!  
They have made a ""blocking option.""  
They have made a ""report this user"" option.  
They have a ""mute option""  
They have a ""ban option""  
What else do you expect Social Media to do? People will be like ""He is bullying me SO I will suicide and give up my life. I HATE FACEBOOK"" Well newsflash for you ""FACEBOOK HAS THESE ABOVE OPTIONS. WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THEM HUH?""  
Stop blaming social media.  
  
So, please don't say that cyber-bullying is because social media exists. Cyber-bullying exists BECAUSE BAD PEOPLE EXIST.  
If not cyber-bullying, we have Rapes, harassment, robbery, murder, stealing lunch etc etc.  
What about that?^^  
No matter where you go you will find BULLYING in one way or the other. THIS IS BECAUSE OF BAD PEOPLE FOLKS!  
Tomorrow, if some murders with a KNIFE. WHO WILL YOU BLAME?  
The Knife?  
Or The one who USED THE KNIFE?  
  
So you see, knife is a tool to serve your purpose, but the way you USE knife is totally up to you.  
And let me make this clear, THERE IS NO STOP TO BULLYING IN ANY MANNER. Bullying does stop at cyber-bullying.  
  
If you look at the Obama's speech against Trump, the way he made a mockery out of him (DO NOT VOTE TRUMP!!!) this means I will BLAME the MIC and not OBAMA because MIC is a tool.  
Or if you see trump's speech where he throws out Muslims. THIS IS ALSO BULLYING where I will blame the mic and not TRUMP!! That's just RIDICULOUS.  
  
So why differentiate with Social Media? Even Social media is a tool, like mic or knife.  
  
Moreover, if a kid is facing cyber bullying, it is clearly understood by his behavior and facial expressions that ""Something is not right."" and they are vulnerable to THREATS. Which is what parents must understand and THIS is where they must interfere. But being stupid they DON'T and let their kid go through that and then regret. This is again the PARENTS to blame.  
Even the kids who are not mature, need help. We understand. This is why PARENTS have to take the step. DO NOT BLAME SOCIAL MEDIA for someone else's mistake. I repeat.  
  
The girl who killed herself is utterly stupid. She was looking for attention and when she found herself being humiliated for what she did, she starts to blame FACEBOOK.  
  
However, Social Media is now keeping a check of all accounts whether you know it or not to act against cyber-bullying and hacking. If they find any suspicious activity, they WILL take action against it.  
My point being that  
  
The AGE must be lowered to 10 so that every one has equal access and rights but they have to be monitored.  
All these technologies that we humans created, are all tools. Now that everything that depends on is HOW we use it. Humans just don't want to blame themselves so they look forward to blaming tools regardless of their ages.  
  
Social Media is a BOON in this era which everyone should utilize it. Please do not snatch this BOON from small children. Let them experience this BOON but at the same time take care of them.  
  
Let me tell you this,  
We have worked hard enough to achieve what we have today. So respect what we made. Respect our INVENTIONS.  
Don't blame our technology or tools. Blame the ONES who MISUSE THEM.",Education,1,Should-the-social-media-age-be-lowered-to-10/1/,53519

215,"I believe that students should not be able to talk in class during all of my distinguished opponent's given circumstances except for circumstance 4. If a student sincerely needs to use the bathroom, then they should be able to speak out. In all circumstances, it is disrespectful and frowned upon, but the bathroom situation is an exception. School, no matter what aspect of it, is preparing you for the real world. Whether it is working, behaving in a proper manner and instilling common etiquette skills. I will support my arguments using real-world examples. Now, as for students talking during class, talking while a teacher is talking is considered disrespectful. If you talked while your boss was talking to you, or if you were talking during a meeting when someone else was talking, you will more than likely be given a stern warning, and if you keep up showing disrespect to your coworkers and/or bosses, you will be on the fast track to being fired, losing a raise, being demoted or not being promoted. You will have a bad reputation, not only with your coworkers , but also within the workplace. Many kids claim that they talk during class because they do not want to learn. Oh well, life is tough and unfair, and you will not make it anywhere in the world once you leave high school because you will have to do things that you will not want to or that are very unappealing. Kids do not understand that schools are providing you what you will need in the real world so that you can have a successful life. If you don't want to learn those valuable things, then you are simply making it harder on yourself. Many more kids say that they talk in class and do not pay attention because they think the class is boring. Whether or not you find a class boring is not anybody's problem except for yours. If you do not like a class and/or find it boring, suck it up and take it. There are going to be times like that all throughout your life, whether in high school, in college, at work, or even at home. Just face it. Life will always have boring situations and you may not want to do something, and if you do not do what you are told, the only harm done will be done to you, by you. One last point: students say that talk and do not pay attention because they do not like the teacher. The students say that they want to choose their teachers. Well, if students were permitted to chose their teachers and their classes (which you can sort-of-kind-of do in high school; they give you a little more leeway and are not as strict. Then again, by the time you reach high school, you usually have the sense to be respectful and not talk during class and to pay attention and do your work), they would not be accurately prepared for adult life. In the real world, you cannot choose your boss or the people you work with. If you do not learn what schools are preparing you with, you may have a small choice in the job you want (like what fast-food joint you want to work at), but, regardless of your choice of job, you will more than likely find it boring, and you may look back and wish that you did better in school, and maybe you should not have been talking during class and maybe you should have paid more attention. Ultimately, school is preparing students for life, for the real world. If students do not value what they are being taught so much as to be disrespectful, then the students must not care about their future.

216,"My initial complaint was with Pro arbitrarily defining the term 'young people' to mean 10 and under and then arguing that only their opinions matter. He seems to have dropped these points. His new trick is to suggest that my contentions only apply to certain age groups, which is ridiculous. My arguments - Batman is a criminal, emotionally unstable, and abusive to children - are all straightforward and universally understood. My Case Gotham's Biggest Criminal Pro's argument is a non-starter; he cannot both praise Batman for stopping crime and then condone Batman's crimes. By claiming Batman's actions as just a means to an end, Pro renders law, and thus Batman's entire mission, meaningless. Even Batman doesn't pretend what he's doing is right or legal. He runs from the police and only works with Commissioner Gordon in secret. He was relieved when Harvey Dent, an ""honest"" crime fighter, came to town. He doesn't work with the public or even make himself or his goals known. He clearly knows what he's doing is wrong and self-defeating, he just can't help himself. Pro tries to go line by line and explain why Batman's crimes are exceptions to the rule (though he conveniently leaves out the more serious charges), but he misses the whole point. There is a reason we don't see police officers breaking into homes without warrants, hanging criminals off balconies, or driving their cars through buildings. Vigilantism puts the public in danger, disregards the rights of the accused, undermines our justice system, and destroys civilized society. No results Batman could ever attain would erase the damage of his renegade antics and the fact that his irresponsibility is the antithesis of everything he claims to defend. Why So Sociopathic? Pro concedes the crux of my argument: Batman is insane. He goes on to say that he is still admirable because he continues to ""move on in the only way he knows how."" But...he's not moving on, is he? In fact, he is as emotionally and psychologically stunted as a person could ever be. He modeled his entire adult life around a single childhood trauma and it has ended him as a person. He isn't Bruce Wayne anymore. He's a husk of vengeance and loneliness, hiding his face and sitting alone in the dark. What message does this send to readers? That when faced with pain, repay the world in kind? That when adversity strikes, dwell on it, make it the center of your world, and forsake all others in the process? That is about as unhealthy and unhero-like as it gets. Generally, heroes use personal loss as a source of inspiration, not obsession. That's why, in the pantheon of superheroes, only Batman has no friends, no love, no life of any kind. He only has the mask. Batman's story isn't admirable, it's pitiable. Worst. Babysitter. Ever. Let me get this straight...Batman trains children to fight murderers, physically takes the children to the murderers, watches as they are murdered, and he bares no responsibility? Seriously, it's like a karate instructor taking a van full of his 12 year old students to a crack house and telling them to go make some citizens arrests. I'm sorry but I respect Pro too much as a debater to think that he believes his argument. What Batman has done - providing children with weapons, instructing them to fight, teaching them to break the law, etc. - isn't just bad parenting. It is the very definition of child abuse, neglect, and endangerment [1][2]. Even if we used the perspective of a child, as Pro would like us to do, the sight of the heroic Caped Crusader leading his own biological and adopted children to their eventual brutal deaths is hard to admire. Well, at least he doesn't actually physically assault them himself or anything... ...and my personal favorite: Counter-Arguments Batman is...a good guy? Pro seems to concede my point here by agreeing that there is a difference between doing a ""good"" act and being, on balance, a ""good"" role model. He states that the Joker's crime fighting doesn't change his negative nature. Similarly, Batman's crime fighting does not change his sociopathic criminality. The difference is that I, like our criminal justice system and society at large, do not believe that good intentions alleviate someone of their wrongdoing. There is a reason manslaughter is a crime; intentionality of a bad deed may influence the extent of one's punishment but it doesn't erase it and it certainly doesn't make the perpetrator a good person. Batman vs. the Police Pro seems to think it is my burden to prove why recklessly and dangerously taking the law into your own hands is wrong. By this point I have made that reason abundantly clear, but that demand still strikes me as odd. In any case, Pro concedes that it is the responsibility of the police, not Batman, to maintain and enforce societal good. Batman's actions, which rest completely outside the law and forces him to interfere with their operations constantly, serves largely to obstruct their mission and waste their resources. A perfect example of Batman hindering justice is Pro's example of supposed selflessness. At the end of The Dark Knight, Batman takes the blame for Harvey Dent's murders. Pro wrongly attributes this to Gotham City's need for ""a person to hate."" As I explained previously, Batman admired Dent because Dent's motives were pure and his actions legal, as opposed to his own psychotic lawbreaking. Now, Batman decides to lie to the entire city and use countless governmental resources and manpower hunting him down for the one crime he didn't commit. Once again he gets in the way of the actual law enforcers and takes them away from solving actual crimes. This ""sacrifice"" is actually making Gotham less safe.

In any case, Pro concedes that it is the responsibility of the police, not Batman, to maintain and enforce societal good. Batman’s actions, which rest completely outside the law and forces him to interfere with their operations constantly, serves largely to obstruct their mission and waste their resources.   A perfect example of Batman hindering justice is Pro’s example of supposed selflessness. At the end of The Dark Knight, Batman takes the blame for Harvey Dent’s murders. Pro wrongly attributes this to Gotham City’s need for “a person to hate.” As I explained previously, Batman admired Dent because Dent's motives were pure and his actions legal, as opposed to his own psychotic lawbreaking. Now, Batman decides to lie to the entire city and use countless governmental resources and manpower hunting him down for the one crime he didn’t commit. Once again he gets in the way of the actual law enforcers and takes them away from solving actual crimes. This “sacrifice” is actually making Gotham less safe.   I look forward to my opponent’s final round.   References  1.   http://www.childwelfare.gov...  2.   http://www.legalmatch.com...",Miscellaneous,2,Choose/5/,10737

219,"I will be arguing that kids in junior high school should not have cell phones. Unfortunately this is only a one-round debate, so my contentions will go unrefuted, whereas I will have time to address and rebut my opponent's arguments. He first claims that ""If junior high kids did not have cell phones it would not be very fun for the students."" This is an interesting jump for kids to students, as not all students are kids and not all kids are students -- I think it would be fascinating to find a non-kid as a student in junior high school, but I digress. First, my opponent appears to be suggesting that ""it"" isn't fun for students without cell phones. What is ""it""? School? If it's school, then the obvious response is that (1) school is not intended to be fun; it's intended as a place to hone young minds and equip them with the tools they need to grow and flourish into responsible, intelligent adults (2) why would you want to use a cell phone in school, where students are already prone to distraction? It would merely enable students to hold background conversations while they should be listening to their teachers and allow them to, if they so choose, cheat and (3) does not contribute to their learning in any way -- if it did contribute, Pro has not provided us with how it does, so we must assume that it dos not. There's also the point that ""fun"" is subjective and some students may find school fun, any way, simply because they love to learn. I happened to be one of these kids, actually. If Pro is simply making a general statement that having cell phones is fun, then the same basic reasoning applies: (1) fun is subjective (2) fun is not an argument unto itself; just because something is fun doesn't mean you should do it. For instance, toilet-papering a house is fun, but that doesn't mean that I should do it (3) it is possible to have fun without a cell phone (4) you can't exactly miss what you have never been exposed to, so saying that ""it would not be fun"" is simply unfounded (5) the negative ramifications -- cheating, distractions, etc. -- outweigh the benefits. Pro then claims that cell phones would be useful tools, but gives us only one example: communication. First, to communicate with whom? Their friends while they are still in class? I've demonstrated why this is potentially dangerous. How about with their parents? This is ostensibly plausible, but not only is there not a need for it -- in junior high school, many students either take the bus home, carpool with their friends, or have their parents pick them up, anyway -- but the negative ramifications, again, outweigh the benefits. Communication during the school day merely invites problems, especially when we're discussing junior high school students, who are by definition young and immature. Now that I have refuted my opponent's contentions, I will offer my own: 1. Junior High Students are Young and Immature This merely goes without saying, and people can look back to their junior high days when they were about 11, 12, or 13 and consider what they did when they were in school. This is a matter of trusting these children with a device that is potentially dangerous and could potentially cost their parents quite a pretty penny. 2. Monetary Cost-Benefit Analysis Cell phone bills are VERY expensive. While it could be ""fun"" to have a cell phone -- again, fun is subjective -- there is no evidence whatsoever that it is NECESSARY. Young children do not need a fun for communication or for any other reason because they are still minors and their parents still provide for them, so this is simply a waste of money for their parents, many of whom are already struggling amid this economy. This also gets to the point about maturity. Some phone plans -- mine, for instance, because I'm a poor PhD student who effectively lives in the Stone Age -- charge per text. Therefore, the kids are left either without texting, which takes the ""fun"" out of it, or because they're immature and disobedient to authority, they opt to text anyway even if their parents asked them not to, and cost their parents quite a lot of money. 3. Cell Phones are Dangerous Let's ignore for a minute the cancer risks from cell phone radiation and so forth. Using a cell phone is effectively using an unbelievable tool whereby you can contact anyone in the world at any point in time. At the same time, people can contact you, can add your number to lists, can attempt to steal your identity, etc. Can we trust young children with that kind of responsibility? Pro has provided us with no reason why we should. Conclusion I have negated the resolution. Please Vote Con.",1,JohnMaynardKeynes,"

Response: First, you still have your anonymity. Second, the First Amendment says nothing about anonymity. Claim 8: All that remains here is what's safe and approved of. Response: Indeed. There are terms of service which we must all agree to before using this site. For instance, profanity is disallowed. This is because this site is intended for people of all ages and all walks of life. We are also not supposed to insult each other and such. This is because the creators of the site wanted a safe, friendly place for people to have a meaningful exchange of ideas, rather than a site filled with flaming and trolling. Even so, this point is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand, since identity confirmation does not remove any content. Claim 9: No real discussion can happen under these conditions. Response: Then what is this? What is the comments area? No discussion is stopped or limited due to identity confirmation. Claim 10: This site has become a classic example of how intellectual property law destroys innovation. Response: Intellectual property laws have nothing to do with identity confirmation. Also, what innovation is being destroyed? Claim 11: This page does not deserve ownership of its domain. Response: They paid for it, and they put a lot of work into making a great site around it. My opponent gives no reason why they do not deserve their domain, and even if he did, that point would be completely and utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand, like most of the claims my opponent has made. Now, I will tell you why the need for identity confirmation is not absurd. As a long-time member of this site, surely my opponent knows of the utter blight multiple accounts were on the voting outcomes of debates. As one of the older members of the site, let me assure you that it has been a major problem in the past. Luckily, the debate.org staff came up with a good way to limit the usage of multiple accounts without causing other big problems. Identity confirmation.

Response: Really? In person it's not. Even so, how is this identity confirmation limiting anyone's anonymity? No one on this site has any idea who you are unless you make that information known yourself. That's anonymity, and it's intact.  
  
Claim 7: Stripping anonymity is limiting First Amendment rights.  
Response: First, you still have your anonymity. Second, the First Amendment says nothing about anonymity.  
  
Claim 8: All that remains here is what's safe and approved of.  
Response: Indeed. There are terms of service which we must all agree to before using this site. For instance, profanity is disallowed. This is because this site is intended for people of all ages and all walks of life. We are also not supposed to insult each other and such. This is because the creators of the site wanted a safe, friendly place for people to have a meaningful exchange of ideas, rather than a site filled with flaming and trolling.  
Even so, this point is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand, since identity confirmation does not remove any content.  
  
Claim 9: No real discussion can happen under these conditions.  
Response: Then what is this? What is the comments area? No discussion is stopped or limited due to identity confirmation.  
  
Claim 10: This site has become a classic example of how intellectual property law destroys innovation.  
Response: Intellectual property laws have nothing to do with identity confirmation. Also, what innovation is being destroyed?  
  
Claim 11: This page does not deserve ownership of its domain.  
Response: They paid for it, and they put a lot of work into making a great site around it. My opponent gives no reason why they do not deserve their domain, and even if he did, that point would be completely and utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand, like most of the claims my opponent has made.  
  
Now, I will tell you why the need for identity confirmation is not absurd. As a long-time member of this site, surely my opponent knows of the utter blight multiple accounts were on the voting outcomes of debates. As one of the older members of the site, let me assure you that it has been a major problem in the past. Luckily, the debate.org staff came up with a good way to limit the usage of multiple accounts without causing other big problems. Identity confirmation. It serves a very much needed purpose, so one could hardly call it absurd.

230,"While I agree that there is merit to the idea of pedophilia being punishable by life sentences, I strongly object to my opponent's logial backing for this idea; his argument can best be summed up as, ""pedophilia is similar to homosexuality. Homosexuality is not based on choice, so neither is pedophilia. If pedophilia is not based on choice, then once a criminally-inclined pedophile, always a criminally-inclined pedophile."" In reality, the argument is about the possibility of ""reforming"" homosexuals. I will first highlight a few sentences of my opponent's argument in particular: ""A bi-sexual clearly makes a choice as to their preference on any given day."" Actually, no, a bisexual is attracted to both in general (sometimes leaning towards one gender). It's not a choice of preference, it's an allowance of both - in other words, avoidance of the choice. ""Why is it a homosexual can not be rehabilitated but a pedophile can. There is no scientific logic here. One can only come to the logical conclusion. If a pedophile can be reformed a homosexual can be reformed. If a homosexual cannot be reformed than a pedophile cannot be reformed."" That's like saying, if an orange can be skinned without using a knife, so can an apple, and if an apple cannot be skinned with a knife, then an orange cannot. My opponent's ""logical conclusion"" relies on a basic similarity between pedophilia and homosexuality that is not there. They do not work on the same system, and what applies to one does not necessarily apply to the other. For one thing, one is based on abuse, while the other is not. For another, one is caused more by issues while another by biological factors - though there is enough controversy about the causes of both for me to not use this argument at the moment. ""If the later is true then a pedophile should never be let out of prison once they commit an act of pedophilia of any kind."" Here's the thing: being a pedophile means being sexually attracted to children. This is a BAD THING, but it is not the same as acting on pedophilic urges. A pedophile is not a criminal nor a morally bad person unless they either abuse or attempt to abuse children - in other words, it is possible to be sexually attracted to children at the same time as not DOING anything wrong, which would certainly be part of reforming a pedophile. Therefore, sentencing pedophiles to life sentences would be something done based on the magnitude of the crime, NOT on the likelihood of another crime. The main question here is - should somebody be jailed for potential crimes they may commit? Generally speaking, that's what intensive therapy is for. Do I believe that acts of pedophilia should result in life sentences? In some cases, I definitely do. Do I believe that a non-life sentence can be justifiably extended to a life sentence as a precaution? Definitely not. There are already precautions in place for convicted pedophiles - registries, prohibitions, etc. Jail as a precaution is an unacceptable corruption of the justice system. ""It is politics that is separating the homosexuals from the pedophiles with regard to the rehabilitation argument."" No, it's science and logic. I'm going to skimp out on the science here, because any sources we throw at each-other will be immediately rejected (though if my opponent is willing to play that game, I'll certainly join in in round 2). Here's the logic, though. Homosexuality is revolves around a relationship between two consenting adults. Children are in no way involved. Nobody is harmed, unless they haven't taken precautions, but because they're consenting adults, that's their own fault. In other words, homosexuality is victimless. Pedophilia, however, is just another form of rape. That's not politics, that's thinking. ""And it is done so at the expense of the children."" The statement comes immediately following the last one I commented on (""It is politics that is separating the homosexuals from the pedophiles with regard to the rehabilitation argument"") so the point is obvious - homosexuality is harming our children. Again, the reason homosexuality is different from pedophilia is because one of them doesn't involve the rape of children - or any type of rape at all, for that matter.* To say that there is no difference between them in that context is the same as saying that a child is harmed by being aware of alternate lifestyles as much as by being the victim of rape and molestation. That is extremely illogical. It's also an elegant trap - one cannot help but agree with condemning pedophiles (unless one wants to look a pedophile supporter); to agree with life-long sentences for pedophiles is to agree with part of my opponent's argument, so, if one gets caught up in the ""save our children"" hype, one can easily be led to believe that to love our children is to hate homosexuals. My opponent's argument is based two false premises: that pedophilia is a sexual orientation (""If this were true then simple logic dictates that a pedophile is also born that way and they cannot help but be a pedophile""), and that being a pedophile and committing acts of pedophilia are the same thing. The following links in my opponent's logic chain are, therefore, invalid: ""Pedophilia is similar to homosexuality,"" and ""If pedophilia is not based on choice, then once a criminally-inclined pedophile, always a criminally-inclined pedophile."" Should we punish (acts of) pedophilia? Yes.

235,"I thank my opponent for this debate topic. First, you are slightly misrepresenting my argument. I'm not claiming that luck was what brought Hitler to power, but that it's a significant factor to his rise of power. As I argued in the previous round, I claimed that an operational version of your proposed definition is to measure how much the social influence said individual caused due to his own will and not to external circumstances that simply involve him. In other words, you aren't a great leader simply because times were good under your rule and you get lucky - a good measurement of what deems one to be a great leader is when you can point at a change as a consequence of their choice. Discriminating between this distinction is important, as my argument lessens Hitler's status as an incredible leader. I am not denying that Hitler was a great orator, and I am not denying that even under the circumstances Germany was in during the 30's it is still a hurdle to rally the country as Hitler did. However, I am claiming that this isn't as grand as you may express it to be -- after all, while effort is needed it basically consists of a large, susceptible country who have been charmed by the idealistic (but ultimately false) promises of their leader. Further unbeknown to them were the political dirty work Hitler did to squeal any possible political problem. To add to my point, after Hitler basically became the supreme commander of Germany, he displayed numerous times disastrous failures on his part, both political and military. While Alexander made huge mistakes as well, his track record is much better than Hitler's (his undefeated military record being a notable mention). =================== Alexander the Great ==================== Before I reference Alexander the Great, I want to note a sense of vagueness in this debate. The title implies that Hitler can, at the very least, be at par with other leaders. However, this is made unclear as in your second round you claim that if I can provide a better leader, I would negate your position. This would imply that you posit Hitler to be the greatest leader of all time -- I suppose at this point there is no way you can clarify, but I will work off this interpretation. First, both Hitler and Alexander were military commanders, but the latter is obviously superior. His tactics are still being studied today, and he is commonly stated to be undefeated in battle (that is, despite the near-mutiny in India he has yet to lose a battle). Perhaps there are qualitative differences between political and military leaders, but first of all Hitler was one of the latter AND Alexander particularly shines in this role as he was apt with achieving a cohesive army for the most part of his legendary campaigns. In terms of social influence (per your definition), Alexander introduced lasting influence with his most obvious contribution being Hellenistic civilization. Hitler mainly caused large turmoil and damage, but this isn't anything socially significant except to perhaps motivate many History channel documentaries, or more seriously lead to some other political conflicts. However, I don't count this into the equation as he probably didn't want to will these side effects - his goal was quite different, obviously. Again, remember that evaluating a leader even under your definition should be confined under the focus of their intent. Alexander is clearly a superior leader given his ability to consolidate the many nation-states of Greece, amazing tactical ability in foreign land and against great odds (his army rarely succeeded 40K and were commonly far from supply lines), plus his ability to leave not wastelands but structured civilizations. Founding cities, canals, ports, etc. was what he accomplished as he spread throughout countries, meaning he wasn't a senseless barbarian. Plus, the guy was just plain bad@ss - he fought in the front lines, and conquered a vast majority of the known world at the age most people graduate from universities ;)",1,TheSkeptic,"

Or saying that fighting for sexual equality fights to harm non-LGBT individuals. When, in reality, gender equality (and equality in general) is focused around giving equal rights to both sexes, and eliminating the struggles that are produced from patriarchy. Such struggles include: A) Women being misrepresented in politics. B) Rape of both men by women (out of a sense that men are viewed as people who will always accept and appreciate sex willingly) and women by men (out of a perception that women can be viewed as sexual objects). C) Objectification of women in the media. D) Discrimination against those who slip out of their socio-gender normative, simply because they wish to be more individualistic (Ex: passive gay men being compared to women. Which itself is a main lead for same-sex rape within prisons, as passive gay men (or simply men who don't fit within a tough enough veil of masculinity) become to be seen as easy substitutes to women as sex objects). E) Child abuse by mothers/fathers who force their children to mold into a gender normative (Ex: male children being abused for being to 'effeminate', and female children being abused for being to 'masculine'). F) Slut-shaming, which can lead to depression and suicide (as with the case of Amanda Todd[1]).

Going back to the selection process Naruto was considered for the part back then but they were looking for him to mature. During the great ninja war he has shown much more maturity and far greater ability. 3. Sasuke's Criminal actions. Are you forgetting that Sasuke will be charged as a criminal at the end of the war? He may be pardoned by the Hokage for his help during the great battle but he is guilty of assassinating the 6th Hokage Danzo. His actions of assassinating Danzo will be considered a crime against the entire village which he will face charges against after the war. I am not claiming he will face punishment but it will greatly hinder his chance to even be allowed to take part in the Hokage selection process. <URL>... 4. Traditions and bloodlines. In the story of Naruto, the village has maintained a consistant pattern of keeping the position within a bloodline.

240,"C1: Economic Growth If you look up Afghanistan's GDP, it increased *faster* after NATO involvement. It was falling *prior* to NATO involvement in the region.[1] ""The economy of Afghanistan has improved significantly since 2002 due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and investments""[2] Extractive institutions inhibit economic growth as people are not incentivized to produce. Inclusive institutions--imposed by the NATO regime--allow people to have private property and there are greater incentives to work and produce. Therefore, had the Taliban been allowed to control the country, economic growth would have been much less than we have seen. Inclusive institutions have been found, throughout history, to increase economic growth. Whereas extractive institutions decrease growth. (Why Nations Fail, book). Therefore, NATO's involvement in the Afghan economic system have benefited the people of Afghanistan. C2: Political Stability NATO has assisted Afghan security forces in building a system which will prevent future terrorist groups from taking over the country. Preventing terrorist forces from reoccupying Afghanistan is one of the main reasons the international community has dedicated itself to assisting Afghanistan. The governments from all around the world have been giving aid to Afghanistan, which has drastically increased economic growth and stability in the region. The UK alone has pledged to give 178 million pounds per year throughout 2012 - 2017. This aid will assist Afghanistan in ""maintain[ing] its own security and prevent the return of international terrorists."" <URL>... ... As noted above, the economic security of Afghanistan has increased dramatically due to foreign intervention. This contributes greatly to the political system, which has a steady flow of income due to foreign investments. Investors prefer countries where the political systems are predictable and easy to understand. This has occurred in Afghanistan due to NATO's assistance. The stability will lead to economic growth, military stability, and a functioning political system where more people can voice their opinions. All of this, which can be traced to NATO's efforts, has helped the country and it's people. The UK, for example, is committed towards helping the new Afghan government. A stable government is the only sure way to ""secure peace and stability"". <URL>... ... In fact, Afghanistan has gone from a dysfunctional state before NATO's involvement to a state where the people can rely on their government for security. NATO merely two dozen patrols each day, whereas the Afghanistan security forces do the rest. The Afghan forces control all but 70 of the 852 bases inside the country. In previous years, NATO would complete hundreds of patrols per day and oversaw almost every military base. However, lessons from Iraq tell us that if NATO leaves prematurely instability may again ensue. It has been noted by many analysts that NATO presence helps the country, and that leaving too soon will put the country at risk. It has been recommended that NATO continues to have 'troops on the ground' in order to continue a stable government. <URL>... ... In fact, much of the issues of stability are related to NATO leaving the country. Therefore, NATO presence increased stability in he country. ""Afghanistan's security situation is likely to deteriorate if U.S. and other foreign forces withdraw"" <URL>... ... In order for elections to be ""free"", NATO forces must stay in the region in order to combat the Taliban, which has been working to subvert the election processes in Afghanistan. Therefore, if anything, NATO involvement should *increase*, not decrease, in order to maximize stability. Later when if they claim that Afghan security forces are harming the country, this notes how Afghani security forces have dramatically improved under NATO supervision and have ""performed adequately"". <URL>... ... ""In southern Afghanistan, security has improved in Kandahar City and in the Arghandab River Valley to the west"" Also security operations in the east of the country ""have decreased insurgent ability to refit and resupply for the coming summer fighting season"" (above link; long war journal) C3: Better Infrastructure Before NATO involvement, most of Afghanistan had any modern infrastructure. In fact, most rural areas had absolutely zero infrastructure. US involvement alone has led to more people having access to clean water, electricity, an improved electrical grid, and 500 medical facilities. Including help from all of the nations put together, there are 600 medical facilities that have been created. The involvement has dramatically increased the well being of the average Afghanistan citizen. NATO is now working with the local government in order to maintain these improvements. ""In 2002, only six percent of Afghans had access to reliable power; today, more than 28% do. . . . USAID has invested more than $2 billion on the construction and rehabilitation of more than 2,000 kilometers (km) of roads, including Afghanistan""s Ring Road, which connects the country""s five major cities . . .

USAID erected two high schools for 12,000 students in Kabul City and four provincial teacher-training centers in Faryab, Nangarhar, Parwan, and Wardak, and six faculties of higher education facilities in Bamyan, Parwan, Herat, Balkh, Jawzjan and Faryab."" <URL>... ...

Therefore, had the Taliban been allowed to control the country, economic growth would have been much less than we have seen. Inclusive institutions have been found, throughout history, to increase economic growth. Whereas extractive institutions decrease growth. (Why Nations Fail, book). Therefore, NATO's involvement in the Afghan economic system have benefited the people of Afghanistan.  
  
  C2: Political Stability  
  
NATO has assisted Afghan security forces in building a system which will prevent future terrorist groups from taking over the country. Preventing terrorist forces from reoccupying Afghanistan is one of the main reasons the international community has dedicated itself to assisting Afghanistan.  
  
The governments from all around the world have been giving aid to Afghanistan, which has drastically increased economic growth and stability in the region. The UK alone has pledged to give 178 million pounds per year throughout 2012 - 2017. This aid will assist Afghanistan in ""maintain[ing] its own security and prevent the return of international terrorists.""  
  https://www.gov.uk...  ...  
  
As noted above, the economic security of Afghanistan has increased dramatically due to foreign intervention. This contributes greatly to the political system, which has a steady flow of income due to foreign investments. Investors prefer countries where the political systems are predictable and easy to understand. This has occurred in Afghanistan due to NATO's assistance. The stability will lead to economic growth, military stability, and a functioning political system where more people can voice their opinions. All of this, which can be traced to NATO's efforts, has helped the country and it's people.  
  
The UK, for example, is committed towards helping the new Afghan government. A stable government is the only sure way to ""secure peace and stability"".  
  https://www.gov.uk...  ...  
  
In fact, Afghanistan has gone from a dysfunctional state before NATO's involvement to a state where the people can rely on their government for security. NATO merely two dozen patrols each day, whereas the Afghanistan security forces do the rest. The Afghan forces control all but 70 of the 852 bases inside the country. In previous years, NATO would complete hundreds of patrols per day and oversaw almost every military base. However, lessons from Iraq tell us that if NATO leaves prematurely instability may again ensue. It has been noted by many analysts that NATO presence helps the country, and that leaving too soon will put the country at risk. It has been recommended that NATO continues to have 'troops on the ground' in order to continue a stable government.  
  http://www.heritage.org...  ...  
  
In fact, much of the issues of stability are related to NATO leaving the country. Therefore, NATO presence increased stability in he country.  
""Afghanistan's security situation is likely to deteriorate if U.S. and other foreign forces withdraw""  
  http://www.cfr.org...  ...  
In order for elections to be ""free"", NATO forces must stay in the region in order to combat the Taliban, which has been working to subvert the election processes in Afghanistan. Therefore, if anything, NATO involvement should *increase*, not decrease, in order to maximize stability.  
  
Later when if they claim that Afghan security forces are harming the country, this notes how Afghani security forces have dramatically improved under NATO supervision and have ""performed adequately"".  
  http://www.longwarjournal.org...  ...  
  
""In southern Afghanistan, security has improved in Kandahar City and in the Arghandab River Valley to the west""  
Also security operations in the east of the country ""have decreased insurgent ability to refit and resupply for the coming summer fighting season"" (above link; long war journal)  
  
  C3: Better Infrastructure  
  
Before NATO involvement, most of Afghanistan had any modern infrastructure. In fact, most rural areas had absolutely zero infrastructure. US involvement alone has led to more people having access to clean water, electricity, an improved electrical grid, and 500 medical facilities. Including help from all of the nations put together, there are 600 medical facilities that have been created. The involvement has dramatically increased the well being of the average Afghanistan citizen. NATO is now working with the local government in order to maintain these improvements.  
  
""In 2002, only six percent of Afghans had access to reliable power; today, more than 28% do. . . . USAID has invested more than $2 billion on the construction and rehabilitation of more than 2,000 kilometers (km) of roads, including Afghanistan""s Ring Road, which connects the country""s five major cities . . . The Afghan government and USAID have constructed more than 3,000 wells, primarily in rural communities, to provide reliable clean water for the first time to more than 615,000 Afghans, and nearly 33,000 latrines help to prevent the spread of disease . . . USAID erected two high schools for 12,000 students in Kabul City and four provincial teacher-training centers in Faryab, Nangarhar, Parwan, and Wardak, and six faculties of higher education facilities in Bamyan, Parwan, Herat, Balkh, Jawzjan and Faryab.""

Therefore, once again water is more than just 'drinking' or 'bottled water' but rather a supply for many tasks we need to do in life. 2) Yes, there are worldwide systems and organizations, but they are insufficient to provide every people with water supplies. If those organizations were so great and so effective, how can the nations and people suffering from unapproachable water be existent? I believe that domestic governmental effort through making the water public works much better and efficient. The failures of water privatization is mentioned in my first round's arguments through the examples Great Britain(developed country), and Tanzania(developing country). Let me provide you with some of the successes that public water supply systems have made; Germany has a public system with very low distribution losses; 100% of the urban areas have access while 97% of the rural areas are granted of access. For both urban and rural areas, over 90% has the high sanitation rate. In Denmark, 100% of the population gets water supplies, with more than 87% of high sanitation rate. For the example of a developing country, we have Costa Rica - nearly 90% or the rural areas are granted access, and with almost all of the urban areas getting the supply as well. These data proves that public water systems are certainly more efficient in providing the public with water with good quality and efficiency. 3) My opponent has stated 'there are places where you can get free water'. However, he/she did not state such specific places, and it is not proved. And EVEN IF there were to be places with free water, still people would have to carry the water they need all the way home - which is very inefficient compared to the water pipe systems. 4) ""people who don't work or don't go out into the world and get a job should not get water"" ; means that if one does not have money or a job, they should not be granted the access to water. However, let's keep in mind that no money and no job is caused from lack of efforts. So what about people that are born in adverse conditions? If they have money, does that mean their water supplies, a vital source, has to be cut? A nation and a government should be ready to provide its people, at least a VERY BASIC LIFE SOURCE, instead of abandoning them. 5) There are certain RIGHTS that are granted to people regardless of their jobs or status in money- such as rights to life, freedom of speech, rights to be protected, rights to vote, and so on. And water is one of those sources that should be granted and be provided by the government. Today, I have proved to you that water should NOT be privatized through suggesting; 1) Explaining the nature and qualities of water being a necessary life source and why it should be provided by the government, 2) Explain the Nature of the private companies and how their preference on profits over people can cause harm, plus the comparison with the public water systems which were successful, 3) Possible environmental harms that can come with privatizing water Plus I believe I have rebutted my opponent successfully. However, I haven't really seen a direct rebuttal to theses arguments from my opponent. Plus, what I have seen in the arguments of my opponents were vague. 1) My opponent firstly misunderstood the privatization of water - when it should have been considering the supply of overall water, my opponent has only considered 'bottled water' which was a very limited topic. 2) He/she was also irresponsible in providing people with fair and equal source of water- and when I pointed out the responsibilities of the government and necessity of water supply, I haven't heard the response to that. 3) 'Worldwide systems and organizations of water' or 'free sources' of water were what my opponent suggested. However, they were not specified. Plus, getting water supplies to everybody from those water systems are very impractical - but my opponent as ignored these factors. 4) I haven't seen any reason from my opponent on WHY companies are more efficient or better in providing people with water sources, or why companies can manage the water systems better without harming the environment. 5) Not just these reasons, but I haven't seen a solid argument or a reasoning in my opponent's arguments, and therefore, I do not exactly know what possible solutions or suggestions that were suggested by my opponent. He/she was merely irresponsible, and while he/she tried to tackle my arguments, because they were vague and illogical, they do not stand.(please refer to my rebuttals) Water, once a gain, is a source that is directly related to the rights of life.

These wars spread across planet earth like wildfire, destroying everything in its path. These wars are without a doubt, unpardonable. Though, this does not mean that all war is unjustified. Although most people do not want to admit it, there is such a thing as a necessary evil. Take the ""Trolly problem"" scenario: "" A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you - your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?"" Or what about the ""Ticking Time bomb"" scenario: ""There is a terrorist in custody who has hid a bomb in New York City. The bomb is set to explode in thirty minutes and is going to kill thousands of innocent people. Would it be ok to torture the terrorist to get the location of the bombed out of him?"" When morals contradict morals, people tend to back away from the subject. But you can see what I am getting at here. Many people will come up with arguments of how it wouldn't be moral to push the fat man or torture the terrorist, but the facts are still there, it would be better to do so. The same could be said about war. Many people suffer at the hand of their government, take North Korea for example. The government keeps their people hidden in the dark, if you do not comply with their orders, you are either killed in a gruesome way, or thrown in an inhumane prison. North Korea has a concentration camp known only as ""Camp 22."" Camp 22 was established in 1959. As of today, there are an estimated 50,000 prisoners held in Camp 22. Most have been imprisoned because relatives were critical of the Korean Workers' Party or its General Secretary, Kim Jong-il. Analysis of satellite imagery suggests that the camp is surrounded by guarded fences. Housing is clustered in fairly small groups. Reasons for housing the prisoners in this fashion are unclear, but could be to decrease the risk of rebellion. There have even been accounts of chemical experimentation on prisoners using a glass gas chamber for observation. This is just one of many prisons in North Korea. So many people are suffering at the hand of this horrible government. Now, if there was a nation that wished to stand up for what is right and take down North Korea's evil government would it be wrong? Would it be wrong to kill some people in North Korea's army in order to save its civilians? Of course not! Now, what about revolutions? In 1775, thirteen British colonies rebelled against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The thirteen colonies decided that they wanted freedom from Great Britain's rule. They wanted to be free from the over priced tax, and they also wanted freedom of religion. Britain was being overbearing and cruel to the colonies. The colonies started the war with Britain and won. After the war, they claimed their independence and later became The United States of America. Surely you can agree that this war also is justified. If you for some odd reason disagree with the two examples above, surely you will not be able to tell yourself that the following example is unjustified. The example that I speak of is invasions of our territory. Let us say that the USA is tired of Canada's export tax on its yummy maple syrup and wants to take them over. So, they send over troops to take down their government. Canada, of course, fights back. By defending her homeland, Canada is starting a war. This war is of course justified. Would it be better just to surrender? No way! If that were the case, The United States of America could be taken over by Jamaica, Mexico, or North Korea! It is obvious that this would not work. On December 7th, 1941 353 Japanese air crafts attacked Pearl Harbor, the next day the USA entered World War Two. The Japanese accomplished exactly what they wanted to do, their goal was to bring the United States into the war. But, it was of course necessary for the USA to enter. It is easy to see that the USA had no other choice then to enter the war; therefore, entering World War Two was justified. Many people today want to feel like they are that someone to stand up against all the bloodshed. They want to come together and say 'enough is enough.' But what these people do not understand is that mankind is not perfect. If mankind was perfect, there would be no need for war. But people are never content with what they have.

As such IF Con admits I refuted their penal theory defense, I declare Con the winner, and thus IF con does this urge voters to vote Con, infact If Con admits that I refuted their penal atonement defense, I urge voters to vote bomb for him. There is your precious win, take it punk, I mean you do want to win right ? It means so much to you, you are willing to resort to word play on the resolution ? so go on, just admit I refuted your defense of penal atonement, and I concede defeat and you the winner of this debate. If Con does not concede that I refuted their defense of penal atonement then I don't concede defeat, then I refer voters to round 1 and 2, where this was actually debated to decided who won. So whats it gonna be Con ?",1,Illegalcombatant,"
  
I think it is quite clear that Con wants to win on a technical point, and not the core issues at had. If you care more about winning this debate on a technical point rather than all the issues referred to in the first round, you do that.  
  
Con says ""In terms of arguing about the historicity of the New Testament, or anything like that. Your resolution does not state ""The concept of Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable."" It states that ""Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable."" If you did not want to argue about the historic event, then you need to learn to craft your resolutions more carefully, or more clearly define them in your opening round.""  
  
I have no idea why Con would accept this debate when I had said this in the first round....  
  
""Elaboration on what it means that ""Jesus died for our/your sins""  
  
I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........  
  
1) Everyone is a sinner  
2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness  
3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners""  
  
You know exactly what I was arguing against, you can't appeal to ignorance.  
  
I am not going to ask for an apology, but I think you should apologize to the people who read this debate, looking too see objections and a defense on this whole Jesus died for our sins, and so forth.  
  
I am not impressed, maybe next time I will get some one who will defend it.  
  
Tell you what Con, you want to win so bad, just admit that I squashed your pathetic defense of penal atonement, and I will concede you as the winner of this debate.

First of all, school uniforms encourage discipline by making students focus on studying and homework rather than new clothes. In the morning, instead of worrying on different outfits, students can do school related activities like organizing their backpack, double-checking their homework, or studying. Students spend a lot of time thinking about clothing, but now, since they have uniforms, they no longer have to go through tedious shopping or hours of decisions of what to wear. School uniforms also help students resist the urge to buy designer clothing. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, the only time new clothes are nexus are weekends, holidays, and summer break, which is a lot less clothes than the entire school year. Clothes can often be used to define social statuses, but if there are no different clothes, people will have to rely on personality rather than the outfit they are wearing. In schools, some students are poor while others are rich. Poor students may have scholarships in order to afford school and have ragged clothes, while rich students may be supported by very wealthy parents and have expensive, fancy clothes.

255,"There are three inalienable rights that binds America together: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we the people have the duty to reject and condemn any law or policy that seeks to deny any American these essential rights. The Marriage Amendment or amendment 2 to the Florida constitution is a deceitful effort by conservative religious groups in the state of Florida to deny brilliant, artistic, caring, innovative, and friendly people the right to seek their happiness by denying them the most sacred form of expressing love to one another. I'm talking of course of these groups trying to deny homosexuals the right to marry in the state of Florida. Lets first start off by proving the advantages the LGBT community brings to a state. Michelle Garcia of the Washington Post reports that ""the city council and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have increased police patrols, despite statistics showing that the area has one of the city's lowest crime rates."" The area she is referring to is the Christopher Street part of the West Village in New York City. This area is not only a very large and almost all gay neighborhood, but also where the infamous Stonewall Riots that catapulted the Gay rights movement took place. Not only does the gay community consistently have lower crime rates but it also has a more culturally diverse and artistic culture. A glance at many of broadway male actors profiles will reveal a huge percentage of actors are gay and well represented in race, national origin, and age. Before I explain why we should not vote on this proposal, I will reveal the areas of Florida that will be particularly hurt and outraged by this amendment. In South Florida, we have in the city of Miami the gay area of South Beach. In the keys, Key West has a very large percentage of GLBT citizens. In Fort Lauderdale, there is Wilton Manors, parts of downtown Ft. Lauderdale, and Davie. And in Central Florida, Tampa, Orlando, and other areas will particularly be hurt. These people are tax paying citizens who wish to be able to one day say those two special words to the person they love, I Do. Moving on to the reasons why you should reject this amendment. Nadine Smith, Co-Chair of Fairness for All Families states, ""it takes away legal protections from unmarried couples; gay or straight. It prevents civil unions, comprehensive domestic partnerships and removes existing legal benefits. There are about 360,000 unmarried couples in the state according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which there are roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples."" This shows that voting for this amendment will harm a significant group of Floridians that could otherwise by left unharmed by voting no. If you also look at what happened in Michigan people had said that they wouldn't go after domestic partnership and civil union benefits once an amendment very similar to this one passed. They immediately after the election starting removed health, medical, legal, and financial benefits. Smith also goes on to state, ""this amendment is not taking away gay marriage, because the legal statues already do that. But what it does do is make it alot harder for us to care for the ones that we love. When Michigan took away domestic partnerships it didn't make married relationships any better, but what it did do is remove the benefits that gay couples had and made it alot harder for them to care for their families and the ones that they love."" To protect the integrity of the Florida constitution and to reconfirm our commitment to ALL of our citizens regardless of their race ,color ,sex , national origin , and sexual orientation.

There are about 360,000 unmarried couples in the state according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which there are roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples."" This shows that voting for this amendment will harm a significant group of Floridians that could otherwise by left unharmed by voting no. If you also look at what happened in Michigan people had said that they wouldn't go after domestic partnership and civil union benefits once an amendment very similar to this one passed. They immediately after the election starting removed health, medical, legal, and financial benefits.  
  
Smith also goes on to state, ""this amendment is not taking away gay marriage, because the legal statues already do that. But what it does do is make it alot harder for us to care for the ones that we love. When Michigan took away domestic partnerships it didn't make married relationships any better, but what it did do is remove the benefits that gay couples had and made it alot harder for them to care for their families and the ones that they love."" To protect the integrity of the Florida constitution and to reconfirm our commitment to ALL of our citizens regardless of their race ,color ,sex , national origin , and sexual orientation. I urge you all to vote NO on the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment.",Politics,0,The-State-of-Florida-should-vote-No-on-the-Florida-Marriage-Protection-Amendment-in-November./1/,61805

But, there would also be many benefits to making cars illegal. With pretty much anything, there are pros and cons. I believe that there would be more cons to illegalizing smoking. I will list a few below. 1. Freedom. There are already many people saying that it is there right to take any drugs they want. I do not know completely if this is true, but there would be an uproar of angry people who believe that smoking is there right. America was built on freedom. Every day that freedom is leaving us little by little. Allowing the government to stop people from smoking is simply a-foot-in-the-door. Do you think that the government should ban chocolate cake because it is bad for you? Do you think the government should ban spray paint because some people inhale it? 2. Taxes The government makes a good deal of money off of tobacco tax. If tobacco is illegal, they would sooner or later find another way to get that money. People would be taxed in other things such as foods, gas, and other necessities. Many people who are not smokers would be angered with having to pay these extra taxes. 3. Criminals If smoking was illegal, that would make everyone who is addicted to nicotine a potential criminal. Many people get sick if they do not have a smoke, so they would go to jail for trying to do something that was legal just a few days ago. The prisons would be filled with smokers! There would also be even more 'drug dealers' who would simply sell tobacco illegally. In the end, there would still be smokers, just illegal ones. 4. More prison cost It would cost the government a lot more funds to house the increased number of prisoners. This would also cost the tax payers millions of more dollars, something that we do not need in today's economy. The government must provide food, health care, Clothing, and rehabilitation costs. In the state of California it cost on average $47,102 a year! Forty five million adults in America smoke. So let's say that half of these people give up the drug (which is very unlikely) and the rest go to jail for a whole year That would cost a shocking $1,036,244,000,000! There is no way that America could even start to pay this. And that is for just one year alone! 5. Mass job loss. Nearly 43,000 people were employed in some aspect of tobacco manufacturing in 1993. It would make thousands of people lose their jobs. Many of these people have families of their own that need to be taken care of. The unemployment rate in America is so high right now that we cannot simply lay off all these people. It would not be the moral or inelegant thing to do. You claim that we should give up smoking because it harms others. Did you know that we are also harmed by the smoke that cars give off? Do we go with the easy choice and ban cars? No, we try to fix it some other way, carpooling, driving less, making more pro-air cars. Same with smoking, if we had to change anything about it why not make a law that says you must smoke in a designated area only. We already have laws about smoking to protect people. You cannot smoke at schools or in hospitals, many people cannot smoke at their own jobs, and it is now illegal to air tobacco commercials on television. There are many things that we could try, but I do not completely see the need. There are plenty of other things that are harming us, and second hand smoke is at the bottom of the list. Smoke going into the air is not as bad as you are making it seem. It is most unlikely that we will pollute the planet that bad with smoke from tobacco.

258,"I'd like to again thank my opponent for not only raising this topic but for providing a position that mirrors what I too had thought to be true in my distant past. I, like my opponent, believed that time was linear because the measurements of time we perceive on earth are linear. He believes that there is a distinction between space AND time. This is indeed not the case and because he's chosen the rebuttal that I was hoping he would, he's already lost this debate. Both my opponent and I are basing our conclusions based on the link he's provided in his opening argument (The universe - <URL>... ...) that is, that we believe in the theory of general and special relativity (as developed by Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins and a myriad of past and present scientists and astrophysicists). Having agreed to these theories up front, we know that space AND time are not separate notions but rather linked, and thus referred to as space-time (again confirmed with my opponents link). This distinction is pinnacle to these theories and, in short, states that there are really four dimensions as follows: 1) Space 2) Matter 3) Velocity 4) Time It also concludes that these four dimensions are interconnected to each other (as stated in my opening position). Since these dimensions are all interrelated, Albert Einstein concluded that as objects approach the speed of light (the speed limit of the universe aside from theoretical particles and the big bang) mass becomes infinite and TIME STOPS (emphasis added...E=MC2). This isn't to say that events within the universe can't continue to take place, as they do all the time in the presence of light speed but, relative to the light, they are absent time. Now, as my opponent pointed out via his link, the big bang event occurred nearly instantly ""brief period (less than 10-32 seconds)"". This time frame is millions (if not trillions) of times faster than the speed of light. Since time is nonexistent at speeds greater than the speed of light, and the big bang (cosmic inflation) happened at speeds greater than the speed of light, than the big bang must have occurred in the absence of time. Time is only really present when an object moves slower than the speed of light. Since the Universe started out at speeds much faster than the speed of light, time must have started sometime after the big bang and relative to the object traveling at less than the speed of light. Since objects lose their velocity at different rates, time starts for those objects at varying points in the universe. This supports my opening comment where I stated that you could indeed formulate a timeline but the timeline would be relative to the object being measured from the time its velocity dips below the speed of light. This complex discussion and topic just touch the surface of the theories of general and special relativity. Although these conclusions may sound like science fiction to those not versed in these theories they are indeed science fact! It's been proven not only mathematically but in function as well. Here is a real life example: GPS satellites are calibrated to account for the differences in time based on their movement through space relative to our movement on earth. Since the satellites are moving faster through space-time, true time is slower and engineers program this time difference into the relays used to send signals back to users on Earth. Without programming for this space-time phenomenon, GPS signals would provide imprecise data to users on Earth. This time differential, factored with empirical mathematical principles proves that times slows with speed to the point of absolute zero at the speed of light and goes to prove my position that the universe formed in the absence of time. Again, these concepts are based in scientific fact. These facts provide clear support that the universe started in the absence of time (because there isn't a distinction between space AND time) and as such, it's not possible that the universe had a definite starting point in time. Based on these proven concepts, I ask that you vote against the absurd notion that my opponent believes is accurate.",1,HghDnsty,"

Con says ""A more fair comparison to our justice system would be if a person comitted a crime, and then the judge went back in time and prevented them from comitting the crime and comitted it himself instead"" So the judge prevented the crime (so it didn't happen), but commits the crime himself (so it did happen). Also what ever happened to Jesus being sinless, in this illustration the judge is guilty because they themselves commit the crime.

271,"I thank Mongeese for his quick response and condense arguments. My own points will be broken into three parts: a defense of my characters' validity, questions about my opponent's plans, and my counter-strategy. CHARACTER VALIDITY My opponent claims two of my characters are useless, as Graviton will not have access to gravitational particles nor Super Skrull to his power amplifying signal. While these team members are tangential to my plans and were never intended to do much, Pro's claims demand a rebuttal. To start, Graviton is not helpless. His molecular structure is infused with the gravitational particles, allowing him to maintain flight regardless of whether they are present in his environment [1, see: History]. In addition, these particles are theorized to exist within Earth's atmosphere [2][3], giving him full access to his abilities. As for Super Skrull, he is similarly empowered. Like most members of his species, Super Skrull possesses initiate shape shifting abilities [4] and he will be able to stay airborne and battle with ease. Also, Rules 6 and 7 state that team members and their equipment will be modeled on canon to be chosen by the Team Leader. As the canon I specified for Super Skrull lists the power amplifying signal as a component of his character, it necessarily exists during this battle. QUESTIONS ON ROUND 1 While on the topic of character traits, I ask Pro to clarify the existence of Blue Eyes White Dragon in this battle. My opponent chose the Yu-Gi-Oh anime as the source for this creature but provided no specific story arc. As such, we must assume he is referring to its standard incarnation. Since it is too late to alter or specify source materials, I am intrigued at how a holographic projection of a trading card poses any threat. I also ask that Pro elaborate on Mewtwo's psychic force field, mind-wiping, and ability to transport others, as I found no evidence of such powers in his provided link. COUNTER-ATTACK My opening salvo involves the unique and underrated Spider-Man villain, Spot. Using his ability to instantly generate and traverse inter-spatial and inter-dimensional portals, Spot will work to systematically eliminate the opposing team. This is due to Rule 2, which states that no portion of a character's body may leave the battlefield or they will be disqualified. As Spot's portals transport any portion of any object that passes through them to another location of his choosing, he need only have an enemy touch a part of their body to a portal for them to be removed from play. The moment the battle begins, Spot generates handfuls of portals surrounding all sides of each enemy. These warp tunnels will all appear only a hair's width away from their bodies, with the other ends appearing equally near to the outer boundaries of the battle arena. As such, the opposing team is effectively trapped until they inevitably move and teleport part of themselves out of bounds. Fortunately, Pro has instructed each member of his team to jump into action immediately out of the gate; Link drinks a potion, Harry casts spells, Mewtwo erects a barrier, Rayquaza rises to meet Graviton, and Blue-Eyes initiates an attack on Magneto. As the portals appear instantly and without warning, the slight (and not so slight) movements of hands, arms, tails, heads, and wings involved in each of these actions is sufficient to disqualify much, if not all, of my opposition. The remainder of my team is also active at this time. Magneto and Super Skrull protect themselves and team mates with magnetic and invisible force fields, respectively. The latter also renders the rest of his team invisible. Graviton and Peter, on the other hand, prepare to use two of their respective abilities (i.e. gravitation control and telekinesis) to move enemies toward the nearest warp tunnel. The moves these characters make at this point depend largely on how Team Pro reacts to our first strike. Of course, for an enemy to avoid an immediate disqualification and force additional actions on my part, they would somehow how to remain completely motionless in midair despite gravity, telekinesis, and their own movements pushing them toward disqualification. The next move belongs to my opponent. REFERENCES 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>...",1,Maikuru,"

As the portals appear instantly and without warning, the slight (and not so slight) movements of hands, arms, tails, heads, and wings involved in each of these actions is sufficient to disqualify much, if not all, of my opposition.   The remainder of my team is also active at this time. Magneto and Super Skrull protect themselves and team mates with magnetic and invisible force fields, respectively. The latter also renders the rest of his team invisible. Graviton and Peter, on the other hand, prepare to use two of their respective abilities (i.e. gravitation control and telekinesis) to move enemies toward the nearest warp tunnel.   The moves these characters make at this point depend largely on how Team Pro reacts to our first strike. Of course, for an enemy to avoid an immediate disqualification and force additional actions on my part, they would somehow how to remain completely motionless in midair despite gravity, telekinesis, and their own movements pushing them toward disqualification.   The next move belongs to my opponent.

275,"1st, i would like to point that the only times you should be lyrical or focused more on your words is when your free-styling or rap battling. When it comes to making a song, focusing on flow and using less words but with powerful quality is better. I'll give an example of a news article comparing lil wayne to Eminem. It says this: ""The career-defining single for each of emcee is Eminem's ""Lose Yourself,"" an ode to the struggle of becoming a rapper, and Lil Wayne's ""Lollipop,"" a song about sex. Both songs are approximately five minutes long, and Em fits about 50 percent more words in his song. Weezy's lyrics are much more repetitive, so Shady is essentially working twice as hard to produce the same effect. This certainly proves Marshall is talented and hard-working. It proves he can spit complicated rhyme patterns. But is that what makes a great song? By accomplishing the same thing (a number 1 single) with half the words, Tunechi proves he has a better grasp of lyricism than the Rap God. While word count seems like a wacky way to compare two lyricists, if we're calling someone the greatest rapper alive, it's an important consideration. Lyrics are words, and, as Twitter has proven time and time again, the less words you use to express a thought, the more appealing it is. Being able to express a concise thought on a subject is the mark of a genius, and doing it melodically is a sign of a musical prodigy -- both of which describe Lil Wayne."" (1) I'll also illustrate with 50 Cent's average lyrics of ""In da club"" <URL>... ""You can find me in the club, bot-tle full of bub (12 syllables) Look ma-mi i got the x if you in-to tak-in drugs (14 syllables) I'm in-to hav-in sex i ain't in-to mak-in love (13 syllables) So come give me a hug if you in-to gett-in rubbed (13 syllables) Notice how the lyrics are simply, but the rhythm and flow in the chorus is what made the song memorable. It was according to Wikipedia (2) recognized for it's ""blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps."" It was ""a spectacular party anthem"" and showed ""50 Cent's ability to twist his words effortlessly"" and notably ""sparse orchestral samples and snaking chorus."" Now just because some rap talks about things you dislike does not mean that it's meaningless. Rap is about spoken poetry, but it's also music and because it's music, style should not be neglected. Tu pac was widely recognized for his influence more than his beats and Eminem for his lyricism. Now if there is a rapper who blends in style with substance and is original, creative, with many more qualities, most people will probably appreciate his/her music qualities.

Plankton's use of the ""Enlargetron"" can aid him in battle. Plankton has invented various items throughout the Spongebob series, and can use him in his aid during this battle. The Enlargetron is a machine Plankton invented that can make anything bigger, shown in the Spongebob video-game ""Creature from the Krusty Krab."" Plankton can then proceed to use the Enlargetron on himself to make him bigger, preventing Spongebob from simply squashing Plankton with his shoe. At the very least, Plankton will be big enough to not be easily squashed. It is possible for Plankton to be big as Spongebob, or even larger. The use of the Enlargetron gives him better defense in the form of size. 2. Plankton can use his ""Hypno-Pod"", shown in the online Spongebob game ""Plankton's Pernicious plot"". The Hypno-Pod, another invention by Plankton, hypnotizes jellyfish into becoming his slaves, giving Plankton control over them. Once gaining control of the Jellyfish, Plankton can simply direct them to attack Spongebob. The Jellyfish can give Spongebob enough of an electrical shock to make his body and heart to suffer a shock, and thus rendering him unconscious. 3. Plankton can use the ""Robo Krabs"" as a good defense and offense against Spongebob. The robot is a fake Mr. Krabs. It is made of a hard metal. Plankton can simply enter this robot whilst fighting Spongebob. Spongebob cannot simply punch, kick, or use his karate skills to break the robot, considering the strength of the robot. The robot has sharp claws that can be used to crush Spongebob's arms, and even his eyes. Plankton is also skilled enough with the robot, to the point where he could perform random acts with it in order to prove he was the real Mr. Krabs to Spongebob, in the Spongebob episode ""Imitation Krabs"".

280,"According to the IRS ""Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset"", and ""Capital assets include a home, household furnishings and stocks and bonds held in a personal account."" (1) Land is capital, a house is capital, a car is capital, a couch is capital, a bed is capital, a computer is capital, a blender is capital, a TV is capital; it's all capital. Investorwords.com defines capital as ""The money, property, and other valuables which collectively represent the wealth of an individual or business."" (2) In other words, if you own 1,000 books, each one of those books is capital, and can be considered material wealth. Since one is capable of selling their book for money, or trading it for some other product of equal value, the books are considered capital, because the books have a value. If someone collects trading cards, their trading cards are also capital with the rarer cards being of greater value, due to the greater demand and lower supply. One could trade a single rare card for 10 common cards, which is no different than exchanging a dollar for 10 dimes. Currency is simply the representation of material capital, to replace bartering with a system of standardized trade. All property has a value, and so all property capital. If it can be bought or sold, or used to generate revenue, than it is capital. Humans are capital because our skills help to generate revenue; a book is capital because it can be sold or rented.

  According to the IRS  “Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset”, and “Capital assets include a home, household furnishings and stocks and bonds held in a personal account.” (1) Land is capital, a house is capital, a car is capital, a couch is capital, a bed is capital, a computer is capital, a blender is capital, a TV is capital; it’s all capital. Investorwords.com defines capital as “The money, property, and other valuables which collectively represent the wealth of an individual or business.” (2) In other words, if you own 1,000 books, each one of those books is capital, and can be considered material wealth. Since one is capable of selling their book for money, or trading it for some other product of equal value, the books are considered capital, because the books have a value. If someone collects trading cards, their trading cards are also capital with the rarer cards being of greater value, due to the greater demand and lower supply. One could trade a single rare card for 10 common cards, which is no different than exchanging a dollar for 10 dimes.  
     
  Currency is simply the representation of material capital, to replace bartering with a system of standardized trade. All property has a value, and so all property capital. If it can be bought or sold, or used to generate revenue, than it is capital. Humans are capital because our skills help to generate revenue; a book is capital because it can be sold or rented. A horse is capital because it can be used for transportational services, in order to generate a profit. A dog can be capital because it can be used for hunting, and may be bought and sold as pets. So long as it has a value, or a usage it can be considered capital.     Sources:  1.   http://www.irs.gov...   2.   http://www.investorwords.com...

First, you stated ""A waiter must take orders, constantly take care of customers, get the food out quickly and correctly, and be nice. All of this deserves a tip, especially when most of their salary is obtained through tips."" What, i ask you, do you think the pizza delivery men and women do? The waiter in a restaurant makes far more money than the average delivery worker even without the tips. If you use the percentage excuse as you stated in your last argument then you will realize that the food sold at a restaurant with waiters costs far more than a simple pizza. Second, to respond to your statement ""Who's to say that the consumer doesn't have a harder job (factory worker, serviceman, etc.) that doesn't get a tip"" it is because the employer has to take into account of the labour by way of the Fed. government.

When looking at this resolution we must look at the [1]National Organ Transplant act or (NOTA). This was a bill passed by congress in 1984 to establish the procedure for organ donation, as well as to encourage organ donation. one major thing entailed by this bill, was the rule explicitly forbidding citizens to sell their organs.

That said, I offer you three independent arguments; if the impacts I present outweigh the impacts of the Pro, the vote must go to the con. Argument 1: The united states' substantial debt and organ donation is costly This point is fairly obvious to any-one here in the U.S. who has paid even the slightest bit of attention to the past six years; we've been in several wars, supported relief funds to various countries such as Haiti, Japan, and Korea; and have been supporting social security to the elderly and disabled. as of [2] April 11th 2011, the US national debt clock reached $14,279,190,561,330.12. Factor in that the U.S. population is roughly 310,367,111 people, and we see that each citizen's share of the debt is $46,007.42. Along with this already substantial debt, [3]organ transplants cost colossal amounts of money; with the cheapest being the kidney at more than $200,000, and the more expensive transplants being the heart-lung, and intestines only transplants at more than $1,000,000. We can't afford to pay the debt we already owe, the government allowing this funding for organ transplant procedures is completely out of the question. We've even gotten to the point of a [4]Government Shutdown due to lack of funding. Now this is obviously a hot button issue, that will not have consensual agreement in congress. If the Republicans and Democrats couldn't even stop bickering over their own agendas long enough to support the needs of the general American population; what chance is there of funding being allotted for an already controversial issue that only affects a small portion of society?

Argument 2: Families can opt out of their loved one's organs being donated [5] ultimately the families of the deceased make the final decision on whether or not they want their loved ones organs to be donated. So even if somebody wanted to be an organ donor, their family can simply say no; thus the government could be out thousands, even millions of dollars for these financial incentives and never even get the organs. Make a direct link between this and my prior argument regarding funding, and we can see that voting Pro in this debate is not a possibility. For a moment, let's say that some-how funding for these financial incentives has been found, in this case we must still refer back to the fact that families can opt out of their loved one's organs being donated; thus we could (and likely will) still have the negative impact of the government paying out these financial incentives and never get the organs. But it goes even deeper than that; let's say that by signing up to become an organ donor who would be receiving these financial incentives, you forfeit your families right to say no to having your organs donated upon your death. In this case the families will suffer and have their rights violated. When a person dies heir body becomes the property of their loved ones, and by taking away this body (i.e. the organs) the right to property is violated. Now in order to fully and completely grasp this idea, we must realize something first; [6] the dead do not have rights.

Argument 3: Donor indicates that the person is not paid The main impact here, is that in the status quo there are already people who willingly choose to be organ donors, not for any kind of financial compensation; but because they see it as a noble cause and want to support it. However when we pay these people for their organs, they are no longer donors; but they are vendors. Organ donation is a noble act, when some-one decides they want to give their most dear and personal possessions; they only thing in this world that is undeniably theirs, for the sake of another, they should be allowed that dignity. However when we allot money for this charity, it is no longer a noble task; but a way to make a quick buck.

291,"Rebuttal to Opening Argument: To begin, I would just like to note that Pro's opening statement is practically a concession. By stating that the resolution is 'Feminism fights to harm men', then saying that you are only arguing against radicalism within the ideology, instead of the ideology itself, it a concession. Also, by only limiting their arguments to the western world, it is again a concession. The resolution is 'Feminism fights to harm men', not 'Radical misandry fights to harm men in the West'. However, I will still continue with my arguments. I. My opponent says that today's society is feminist, when it clearly isn't. The definition of feminism, as provided in my opening argument, is the abolition of patriarchy in favor of gender equality. Even if we were living within a female privileged society, it wouldn't be feminist. Since there is simply a new hierarchy that would've been established (matriarchy) instead of gender equality. II. My opponent bases his first point on an unsourceable event. Saying that you have been the 'victim' of feminists, then speaking about such event isn't a legitimate source. It is completely biased by your view of the event. Even then, these people you speak of aren't exactly the most prominent theorists within feminism. III. My opponent stereotypes that all feminists 'assume that men are predators'. This is a complete association fallacy, just because some feminists have a certain radical quality (misandry) doesn't mean that all feminists have a radical quality (misandry). IV. My opponent did not provide a source to back up point 3. V. There is evidence that shows that the number of women incarcerated has actually increased. The number of incarcerate women has increased fivefold from 2001, partially due to lack of treatment for women who violate laws. Whereas men have more accessability to such treatment.[1][2] VI. Solanas was both mentally insane, and highly criticized by fellow feminists. Solanas suffered physical and sexual abuse from both her father and grandfather[3][4], and would later in life be diagnosed with schizophrenia and be sent to a psychiatric hospital. Betty Friedan, who is noted as writing the famous book, The Feminist Mystique , said that Solanas' views were far too radical and polarizing.[5] VII. The Violence Against Women Act does not imply such by title. The Violence Against Women Act, by title, implies that women have been the main target of domestic violence historically. Women have only started to be seen as actual human beings with feelings rather than just house-keepers since the end of the Victorian Era. Which has been roughly 100 years. Pro also did not provide a source for point 6. VIII. Many of men's problems, such as homicide, are not caused by class struggle within a gender context. The statistics my opponent has mentioned are not directly caused by patriarchy, so why should strict (meaning they only adhere to this one ideology, that being feminism) feminists deal with such an issue? Are some of the numbers involved in those statistics caused by patriarchy, yes. However, saying that they don't care about men because their ideology isn't able to deal with every problem is baseless. However, most of those numbers were caused by different struggles within society, such as poverty. IX. Male rapes are also the result of patriarchy. Male-male rape usually occurs when one male either a) fails to meet the standards that the male gender has set upon them, and are seen as 'weak' and are more likely to be raped, or b) is seen as a means of achieving sexual satisfaction in a place (such as prison) devoid of females (which by many men can be seen as sex objects) and are used as a substitution. Male rape commited by females also occurs due to patriarchy, since males have to meet a standard of 'becoming a man' and are sexually assaulted by women who seek to gain sex out of such under this guise. This itself can actually cause some men to grow up hating women. Many feminist articles have been published in favor of ending male rape and female rape. Even then, it doesn't matter who gets raped more. Feminism is about trying to end patriarchial culture that harms both women and men. What feminists argue for is to stop rape and rape culture in general. X. The last few paragraphs provided by my opponent were just a copy/paste job.[6] Rebuttal to Second Argument: My opponent starts by reposting some of which they already posted in the first argument, please see above for my rebuttals to such. I. A dictionary definition cannot be 'tainted'. The radical feminists you mention are only more 'popular' since media can make more money by creating a story that is completely out of proportion and spread dishonest information than by telling the truth. Ideological definitions don't just 'change', anyone who is a misandrist or believes in feminine supremacy isn't a feminist by the definition I provided, since they obviously don't support gender equality.

292,"I would like to thank my opponent for a great debate. She turned out to be quite the opponent. 1.Popular Vote vs. Equality In order for this to be true my opponent would have needed to substantiate that there was inequality. Heterosexuals and homosexuals have equal rights. Every person has the right to marry one person of the opposite sex. We HAVE equal protection under the law. I am not permitted to have multiple wives, just like a wannabe polygamous is not permitted to have multiple wives. I cannot marry a man, nor can someone who wants to marry a man. I cannot have sex with an animal (at least in my particular province), just like a zoophile cannot. I cannot have sex with children, and neither can a pedophile. This IS the definition of equal. My opponent is comparing gay marriage to African American rights. This is not analogous and therefore irrelevant. Homosexuality is not innate, but research tends to agree that homosexuality is a learned behavior (1). Gay marriage should not be nationally imposed because it would have to circumvent our current legal system in order to do so. 2.Definition of equality My opponent's definition of equality is not a recognized definition of equal and is logically unstable. She insists that we cannot ""deny someone something because they aren't exactly like [me]."" Such a definition insists that we grant all things to all people - as we will find that no two people are alike. Our current marriage laws are equal in terms of rights. Every individual as the exact same right to marry one individual of the opposite sex. 3.Homosexuality is innate So my opponent's presumption is that because she has seen no evidence to the contrary, that the weak and untenable correlation should be presumed as proof? Would my opponent similarly expect, if no evidence to the contrary has yet been displayed, that climate change is the result of a decrease in pirates? I certainly expect not. No current research comes close to supplying evidence to substantiate the claim (2). The source she gave only supplies a weak correlation and does not account for lesbianism. If indeed homosexuality was innate, it is quite strange that there would be ex-homosexuals(3). 4.Children and Animals cannot give consent You are using the law (of contractual consent) to unquestionably condemn some issues (pedophilia and zoophilia), yet you are condemning the law on other issues (its non-allowance of gay marriage). Where is the warrant for age of consent? Children ARE capable of giving consent - and very often do (adoptions for instance). You call my equivocation abhorrent without proving it as such. Male animals can give consent - and many female animals (the female dolphin for instance) will give signals of consent when they are ready to mate (4). 5.Polygamy and Polyandry My opponent suggests that it would be a blatant cheating of the law to allow 3 or 4 consenting individuals, who deeply love one another, to marry. But it is apparently no cheating of the law to completely circumvent our legal system to establish nationally recognized gay marriage. Can we not change tax laws in regards to individuals with multiple spouses - that does not seem too hard. Not allowing polygamy and polyandry spits in the face of my opponent's definition of equality. 6.Education My opponent does not care that schools would be forced to revamp education in order to support a lifestyle that is against the will of the people. My opponent believes that teaching students that a relationship between a man and a woman - a biologically and anatomically attested match - is homophobic propaganda. Now if she was told, a few days from now, that schools have decided to teach and support pedophilia (but they took the stand of affirming that the child must be of at least age 10), would she not rightly be angry? Angry because she feels it to be wrong and because the majority of other people feel it to be wrong, but, in spite of it all, they went along and did it anyway? I would be angry too.

296,"Meyer may wish to digress, but I'm not going to chase that rabbit. This debate is not about his digression. Similarly, Van McGee's argument has been much discussed and shown not to do what Meyer tries to propose for it in this debate. That's for another time and place (my place, perhaps), if there is interest. Meyer's own claim is, in part: > ""not that the argument is invalid in a particular system > of logic where it would be valid..."" That also is a different debate as is Meyer's effort to suggest, only suggest, that there may be some legitimate logical system in which my argument would be considered INvalid. If he finds one, I will be glad to consider it. The exercise is not about quibbling over ""logical systems"" or whether or not my argument is valid in one or all legitimate, real world logical systems. That my argument may be valid, by definition, according to the rules of one or all legitimate, real world logical systems is incidental/coincidental to the issue before us here. Atheists make the affirmative claim, reach the conclusion, that the idea/concept of God was a product of the imaginative powers of the mind of man. I have presented one argument which, if its premises are true, allows the atheist to reach that conclusion. I propose that atheists cannot, successfully, divorce their affirmative claim from my argument and its implications. I don't recall any of my opposition offering any better argument that supports the conclusion, the atheists' affirmation, though many imaginative stories have been offered as to how the idea/concept originated. The discussion is about reason, not logical systems. In affirming ""imagination"" as the conclusion, the atheist implies the belief that man was possessed of such a power so as to have accomplished the feat; the minor premise. Some even are so bold as to affirmatively, explicitly, claim that the minor premise is true. Given that the conclusion is affirmed and that the minor premise is affirmed, we can easily construct the major premise necessary to complete the reasoning that would, if true, support the atheists' conclusion. My argument is constructed in such a manner that if its premises are true, then its conclusion will follow as true therefrom. To save a little time and effort, we have been referring to such a construction as being ""logically valid"". In closing, I will state my opinion as to why so many have fought so hard against simply, successfully completing the exercise; so much so that they have, historically, refused to take the simplest Step #1 and deal openly, honestly with it. My argument fairly and reasonably reflects a fundamental position of atheists. Atheists implicitly and/or explicitly believe one or both premises to be true. It is undisputed that atheists believe the conclusion to be true. Atheists don't like to admit ""believing"" such things. They ""believe"" the premises and conclusion of my argument, implicitly and/or explicitly. Such beliefs go beyond the evidence upon which their beliefs are based, and some have been open and honest enough to admit that such is the case by noting that one or both of the premises are lacking in evidence and may, in fact, not be true. No tricks. No traps. Just the way it is; in my opinion. It's nice to know as one considers the popular public debate over such things. Atheists don't believe there is any ""God"". OK! I get it! Meyer, I thank you for offering what is probably as good as any opposition may have to my claim regarding Step #1 of the exercise. Hopefully, your final submission will allow us to bring the formal discussion, such as it has been, to a reasonable and cordial conclusion.

Folks should be able to find me at my place if they wish to pursue these matters, or maybe there will be some additional banter in the comments section here.",1,RLBaty,"
  
Meyer may wish to digress, but I'm not going to chase that rabbit. This debate is not about his digression.  
  
Similarly, Van McGee's argument has been much discussed and shown not to do what Meyer tries to propose for it in this debate. That's for another time and place (my place, perhaps), if there is interest.  
  
Meyer's own claim is, in part:  
  
> ""not that the argument is invalid in a particular system  
> of logic where it would be valid...""  
  
That also is a different debate as is Meyer's effort to suggest, only suggest, that there may be some legitimate logical system in which my argument would be considered INvalid. If he finds one, I will be glad to consider it.  
  
The exercise is not about quibbling over ""logical systems"" or whether or not my argument is valid in one or all legitimate, real world logical systems. That my argument may be valid, by definition, according to the rules of one or all legitimate, real world logical systems is incidental/coincidental to the issue before us here.  
  
Atheists make the affirmative claim, reach the conclusion, that the idea/concept of God was a product of the imaginative powers of the mind of man.  
  
I have presented one argument which, if its premises are true, allows the atheist to reach that conclusion. I propose that atheists cannot, successfully, divorce their affirmative claim from my argument and its implications.  
  
I don't recall any of my opposition offering any better argument that supports the conclusion, the atheists' affirmation, though many imaginative stories have been offered as to how the idea/concept originated.  
  
The discussion is about reason, not logical systems.  
  
In affirming ""imagination"" as the conclusion, the atheist implies the belief that man was possessed of such a power so as to have accomplished the feat; the minor premise.  
  
Some even are so bold as to affirmatively, explicitly, claim that the minor premise is true.  
  
Given that the conclusion is affirmed and that the minor premise is affirmed, we can easily construct the major premise necessary to complete the reasoning that would, if true, support the atheists' conclusion.  
  
My argument is constructed in such a manner that if its premises are true, then its conclusion will follow as true therefrom. To save a little time and effort, we have been referring to such a construction as being ""logically valid"".  
  
In closing, I will state my opinion as to why so many have fought so hard against simply, successfully completing the exercise; so much so that they have, historically, refused to take the simplest Step #1 and deal openly, honestly with it.  
  
My argument fairly and reasonably reflects a fundamental position of atheists.  
  
Atheists implicitly and/or explicitly believe one or both premises to be true.  
It is undisputed that atheists believe the conclusion to be true.  
  
Atheists don't like to admit ""believing"" such things.  
  
They ""believe"" the premises and conclusion of my argument, implicitly and/or explicitly. Such beliefs go beyond the evidence upon which their beliefs are based, and some have been open and honest enough to admit that such is the case by noting that one or both of the premises are lacking in evidence and may, in fact, not be true.  
  
No tricks.  
No traps.  
Just the way it is; in my opinion.  
  
It's nice to know as one considers the popular public debate over such things.  
  
Atheists don't believe there is any ""God"".  
  
OK!  
I get it!

304,"The old version of debate.org had some flaws that needed to be addressed. One of the primary flaws was that of those who made second, third, or more accounts simply to vote for themselves and to cheat the system. Mobile phone confirmation makes it much more difficult for one to cheat than simple email confirmation. Anybody can get a free email address any time they desire, and in turn create several accounts skewing their own scores, or harming the scores of others. Since not many people have multiple cell phone numbers, and even for those that do the numbers are far more limited than the nearly unlimited use of email accounts, this will clearly limit the amount of fake accounts created. Alternatives for people who do not have cell phones would be to ask their friends for help, as it is unlikely you will have friends with no cell phones at all, and one that will be unable to recieve a single text message to help you. Consequently, this also helps prevent cheating in that people A. Have a finite, limited number of friends who can help them with this, even if they wanted to use them to cheat and B. Friends will get more annoyed the more you ask them, and finding willing friends goes down the more friends you have found that will help you. SO- while the new cell phone program is not something that will necessarily be good for all individuals in this group, as a whole we benefit with much more fair debates.

One of the primary flaws was that of those who made second, third, or more accounts simply to vote for themselves and to cheat the system. Mobile phone confirmation makes it much more difficult for one to cheat than simple email confirmation. Anybody can get a free email address any time they desire, and in turn create several accounts skewing their own scores, or harming the scores of others. Since not many people have multiple cell phone numbers, and even for those that do the numbers are far more limited than the nearly unlimited use of email accounts, this will clearly limit the amount of fake accounts created.  
  
Alternatives for people who do not have cell phones would be to ask their friends for help, as it is unlikely you will have friends with no cell phones at all, and one that will be unable to recieve a single text message to help you.  
  
Consequently, this also helps prevent cheating in that people  
  
A. Have a finite, limited number of friends who can help them with this, even if they wanted to use them to cheat  
  
and  
  
B. Friends will get more annoyed the more you ask them, and finding willing friends goes down the more friends you have found that will help you.  
  
SO- while the new cell phone program is not something that will necessarily be good for all individuals in this group, as a whole we benefit with much more fair debates. For those who are directly affected by this, they may still use alternative methods of activation- namely asking friends and family for help.",Technology,0,Mobile-Phone-Confirmation/1/,37061
305,"You aren't reading my argument clearly- I stated in the part you pasted that it was the protestants and Catholics, commonly accepted as Christian. The topic of this argument is that Mormons are Christian. If they have his name in the title of their church, is it not somewhat of an indication of their belief in him? And I didn't say that anyone denies him. I said they didn't proclaim his divinity as often or as clearly. Most of those differences have to do with the spiritual definition of God, not the personage we're discussing here (though you guys do think they're one and the same.) The one contrast applying to Christ is that he is the same being as God, and that has nothing to do with pretty much everything important that he did. The important things that he taught and did were not dependent on what he did, since either separate or homosousian (you spelled it wrong), he could have saved us from our sins and taught about compassion and whatnot, according to both religions. The definition of Jesus as the Christ is totally dependent on the fact that he atoned for our sins, something that is as much or more the key of the Mormon religion as much as any other. No differing of opinion on his life or being prior to that act is as pivotal or vital to Christianity. For the record, Mormons also believe in the bible, including the New Testament, the real documentation of his life.

it is not moral to force your view upon others when they define a traditional historical ritual upon binding two people under the eyes of god a god who they have defined doesn't approve of lying man with man. so if it is not moral it most definatly shouldnt be legal

As Sieben rightly pointed out in the comments section, it's pretty undeniable that circumcision has vast medical, aesthetic and physical benefits, and that waiting to get a circumcision later in life can be more dangerous, and it's certainly more uncomfortable, inconvenient and painful. Therefore, Pro's argument will essentially be that despite those realities, it's morally preferable to give the individual the choice later on in regard to his own body. However throughout this debate I will demonstrate that parents have both the right and responsibility to make choices for their small children that will undoubtedly impact them, and that circumcision is merely one of these many choices.

318,"Thank you for those well thought out responses and the rebuttals :)First off I would like to make my thoughts stand out, these are: If someone swears, society will see them as going against ethical morals as the contender rightly states but what is it that makes another action turn someone into a ""bad"" person whereas swearing does not? If I see a peron walk round swearing loads, they could be judgd as "" bad"" but I could be emphasising a point and I am judged as a ""good"" person by the people who know me.. Although, if I went to a stranger and swore, they would most likely judge me as a ""bad"" person as that is all they have seen of me. When you give examples of good you give examples of Jesus, the son of God. He may have done bad things when no-one was looking, he may have sworn once or twice, he may have stolen etc....we do not know as only he, and God knows. The same with the Buddha and God etc but I was thinking more of human beings like, for example, Ghandi. He is seen as a good person by society but hang on, he might have punched a sibling as a child, he might have sworn at someone when he was angry, he could have done anything when he was alone...he could be a pedophile, we just dont know. So, my point being, he cannot be purely good, so why do people see him as more good than me or you? That in itself is unfair and quite arrogant and selfish. Kant said that to do good things and feeling happy about it makes the goodwill fall apart from that action. (not quoted) but ""goodwill shines forth like a precious jewel"" he focused on duty etc...that's getting off topic. When you talk about God being omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, that could bring up a debate in itself. Eg. The inconsistent triad. If God was omnipotent and benevolent he would both want to stop evil in the world (benevolent) and have the power to stop it (omnipotent) but it still exists so he must either not want to stop it or not have the power to stop it. And also, could God create a boulder so heavy that He himself could not lift it? This defeats the object of omnipotence as it over throws it, he can create ANYTHING as he is all powerful, but not something that he CANNOT lift as he can lift it, as he is all powerful. ( I do believe in god by the way, just putting forward arguments :) ) Back on topic. All your examples are true and I agree, all those reasons were wrong and bad but what I am trying to say is, Hitler may have done some good things in his life.

He CANNOT have just done bad all his life,meh must have done some good things. The same goes for all your examples.",1,PeterGray,"
  
Thank you for those well thought out responses and the rebuttals :)First off I would like to make my thoughts stand out, these are:  
  
If someone swears, society will see them as going against ethical morals as the contender rightly states but what is it that makes another action turn someone into a ""bad"" person whereas swearing does not? If I see a peron walk round swearing loads, they could be judgd as "" bad"" but I could be emphasising a point and I am judged as a ""good"" person by the people who know me.. Although, if I went to a stranger and swore, they would most likely judge me as a ""bad"" person as that is all they have seen of me.  
  
When you give examples of good you give examples of Jesus, the son of God. He may have done bad things when no-one was looking, he may have sworn once or twice, he may have stolen etc....we do not know as only he, and God knows. The same with the Buddha and God etc but I was thinking more of human beings like, for example, Ghandi. He is seen as a good person by society but hang on, he might have punched a sibling as a child, he might have sworn at someone when he was angry, he could have done anything when he was alone...he could be a pedophile, we just dont know. So, my point being, he cannot be purely good, so why do people see him as more good than me or you? That in itself is unfair and quite arrogant and selfish. Kant said that to do good things and feeling happy about it makes the goodwill fall apart from that action. (not quoted) but ""goodwill shines forth like a precious jewel"" he focused on duty etc...that's getting off topic.  
  
When you talk about God being omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, that could bring up a debate in itself. Eg. The inconsistent triad. If God was omnipotent and benevolent he would both want to stop evil in the world (benevolent) and have the power to stop it (omnipotent) but it still exists so he must either not want to stop it or not have the power to stop it. And also, could God create a boulder so heavy that He himself could not lift it? This defeats the object of omnipotence as it over throws it, he can create ANYTHING as he is all powerful, but not something that he CANNOT lift as he can lift it, as he is all powerful. ( I do believe in god by the way, just putting forward arguments :) )  
  
Back on topic. All your examples are true and I agree, all those reasons were wrong and bad but what I am trying to say is, Hitler may have done some good things in his life. I can't say what, but I'm sure he was good to Eva Braun, his wife. And I'm sure he will have given a fellow soldier a cigarette in the first world war. He CANNOT have just done bad all his life,meh must have done some good things. The same goes for all your examples.",Philosophy,1,No-one-can-be-purely-good-or-bad/1/,38904

I argue that the Islamic face veil poses problems for integration, because it represents ideas that are diametrically opposed to Western culture. 1. ""Wearing the burqa is an act offensive to Western culture and should therefore not be allowed."" a) It is offensive because it symbolizes male control of women and the total exclusion of women from the public sphere. b) Why do I have to prove Western culture is superior for my argument to work?

We are not debating whether Western culture is superior to other cultures, only whether Western culture is compatible with the Islamic face veil. 2.

Whether Muslim scholars think the face veil is optional is irrelevant to my argument. So what if some scholars think the ""face veil is not even part of the minimum female hijab dress code""? First, this does not indicate that those who wear it wear it by ""free choice."" Second, Con's insistence that the face veil is voluntary obscures the historical purpose, context, and effect of the face veil: patriarchal tyranny over women. 3. ""According to the rationalizations provided by Muslim men, women must wear the burqa because, if they don't, men will rape women who show their face in public."" Quite a few Muslim academics have made this argument: Qasim Amin, Tahrir al-mar'a; Zainab al-Fawwaz, ""Fair and Equal Treatment""; Bahithat al-Badiya, ""Mabadi al-Nisa'I""; Mostafa Hashem Sherif, ""What is Hijab?""; Nawal El Saadawi, ""The Political Challenges Facing Arab Women at the End of the 20 th Century"".

For that, see: Margot Badran's Feminism in Islam , or the works of countless other Western academics, including Judith Tucker, opponents of face veiling. 4. ""Because of veiling, women were not allowed to get an education, nor to have any role in political life. In fact, they were not allowed to have any role at all in public life."" Con states: ""When Muslim women choose the veil, they must also bear in mind there may be certain professions they cannot take because of it, but also there are professions that may suit them perfectly. But this doesn't mean they cannot by any means contribute to society. "" No, according to the history of the veil, it has been a marker of female seclusion. This means women were not allowed to participate in public life. That is the history and meaning of the veil. Con has demonstrated no evidence to contest the history and meaning of the veil as such. 5. ""Con argues that it is the right of woman to wear the veil. Con has provided no evidence that woman have this right."" Con argues: ""What right does he have then to demand evidence from that woman that it is her right to wear what she likes, so long as it's not harming/offending anyone?""

Con's patriarchal arguments are not subtle, trying to conceal themselves under a facade of giving women the right to choose. Women's right to voluntarily wear the face veil doesn't change what the face veil represents nor does it change the fact that the face veil is harmful and offensive. 6. ""The veil clearly represents the patriarchal oppression of women."" Con has not provided any ""Islamic rulings"" that show the veil is not meant for oppressing women. And even if Con were to show such rulings, they would be rulings that completely ignored the purpose, history, and effect that the veil has had in Islamic societies.

You have been relying that much with Harvard's study, but I will make you taste your own medicine! I will show you how your source will turn against you! As a treatment for psychiatric disorders, the risks of marijuana use exceed the benefits, reports the April 2010 issue of the Harvard Mental Health Letter. Regular use of marijuana can lead to addiction and other mental health problems, especially in people who are genetically vulnerable, notes Dr. Michael Miller, editor in chief of the Harvard Mental Health Letter. Addiction. The concentration of THC (the herb's psychoactive component) in marijuana has been increasing in recent years. Addiction specialists are concerned that this increased potency might accelerate development of dependence. Anxiety. At low doses, THC can be sedating. At higher doses, it can induce intense anxiety. Although some people find that marijuana calms them down, the most commonly reported side effects of this substance are intense anxiety and panic attacks. Mood disorders. In people with bipolar disease, marijuana can bring on manic episodes and increase rapid cycling between manic and depressive moods. Several studies also suggest that in some people, regular marijuana use may trigger depression. Psychosis. Marijuana intensifies psychotic symptoms and worsens outcomes in people with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The results of several large observational studies also strongly suggest that using marijuana can increase the risk of developing psychosis, particularly in young people. <URL>...",1,Juris,"

Marijuana does cause dry mouth, impaired motor skills, and red eyes, but however, these effects can be found with alcohol consumption and tobacco consumption.     *Again, the burden of proof has shifted to you, but you failed again to disprove the 2012 study by The National Institute on Drug Abuse. You should not only stated that those effects are found in alcohol consumption and tobacco consumption, but you should have also disprove the study The National Institute on Drug Abuse regarding the effects of marijuana.  ARGUMENTS:  Cannabis can help a person like what you said but it   does not mean that the benefits exceeds the risk  s  .  You have been relying that much with Harvard’s study, but I will make you taste your own medicine! I will show you how your source will turn against you!  As a treatment for psychiatric disorders, the risks of marijuana use exceed the benefits, reports the April 2010 issue of the   Harvard Mental Health Letter.  Regular use of marijuana can lead to addiction and other mental health problems, especially in people who are genetically vulnerable, notes   Dr. Michael Miller, editor in chief of the Harvard Mental Health Letter.  Addiction. The concentration of THC (the herb’s psychoactive component) in marijuana has been increasing in recent years. Addiction specialists are concerned that this increased potency might accelerate development of dependence.  Anxiety. At low doses, THC can be sedating. At higher doses, it can induce intense anxiety. Although some people find that marijuana calms them down, the most commonly reported side effects of this substance are intense anxiety and panic attacks.  Mood disorders. In people with bipolar disease, marijuana can bring on manic episodes and increase rapid cycling between manic and depressive moods. Several studies also suggest that in some people, regular marijuana use may   trigger depression.  Psychosis. Marijuana intensifies psychotic symptoms and worsens outcomes in people with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The results of several large observational studies also strongly suggest that using marijuana can increase the risk of developing psychosis, particularly in young people.  http://www.health.harvard.edu...",Health,1,Does-Cannabis-cause-physical-harm-or-public-endangerment/1/,15011

The Incidental Powers provision simply gives Congress power to introduce such legislation as is necessary for the proper exercise of the powers it expressely has under the Constitution.

My opponent is not correct as to how the Control Substances Act was enacted. The Control Substances Act was enacted pursuant to the International Treaties power (Art 6) ( <URL>... ). The US became a signatory to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and thus it gained the power to prohibit those drugs so as to give effect to the Convention.

I disagree, and believe than gummy bears are better than their work counterparts.  
  
What can you do with gummy worms other than eat them? Not much, and that's pretty boring.  
With gummy bears one could put on a little show. For an example just take a look at my friend's images of a gummy bear reenactment. That's seems like more fun than slurping on a gummy worm.

You can arrange them in such a way that you it seems like they're having a little gummy meeting. (  http://flickr.com...  )  
  
They could be set up to look like they're watching the demise of a fellow gummy bear. (  http://flickr.com...  )  
  
Or even storming your keyboard in a gummy rebellion. Viva la gummy! (  http://flickr.com...  )  
  
You can't do these things with gummy worms, no one has ever made a popular story about worms, but cute bears can be the main characters in many stories.  
  
Gummy bears were also the original gummy creatures. If you try to go to the wikipedia page about gummy worms, you'll get redirected to the page for gummy bears. (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  )

The teacher(from my experience) 90% of the time will go on the bully's side, But the bully watcher sees and hears that the bully student is lying, so the bully watcher can tell the teacher that the bully student is lying.

355,"I am just glad you are still here! My opponent states, ""Although alcohol may be intrenched into western culture, my opponent fails to address that alcoholism can be a serious issue that can tear families apart, result in rapes, drunk driving."" Indeed it is sometimes remarked that were alcohol to be discovered today, it would have been immediately banned, along with hard recreational drugs. However it is an ancient part of my culture and civilisation, my right to drink it is part of civil liberties, my civil liberties are a key part of my culture and civilisation, the act of drinking is a key part of social interaction, so again key part of my culture and my civilisation. The fact that it may be harmful, the question of if I should or not consume it is a separate one. It does not actually have any relation to the resolution. For the same reason I will not bring up the issue of the health benefits of moderate alcoholic consumption nor the terrible human cost of organised crime that will be created by prohibition. Alcohol is part of my civilisation, if/when Muslims reach a majority in Britain it is likely that to be outlawed or restricted.

This is a clear gender imbalance, the two genders are not equal in the law.

Be it war, wife beating, divorce and so on and so forth. It is a much maligned and distorted book. However carefully or thoughtfully written the rules on wife beating are they represent a clear inequality between men and women. Should there be a passage in the koran that states ""Wives as to those husbands on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) arrange with your male kinfolk or a local court to beat them (lightly) ..."" Then we would see gender equality. Until we do so, which is not going to happen as the koran can not be so casually re-written, and given that Islam is increasing in the west we must conclude that Islamic values is a threat to western values, hence western civilisation. My opponent states ""Another claim by my opponent is that there is equality in the west. True equality in the truest sense is impossible. In a truly equal society everybody would be living in the same standards and making the same amount of money."" I believe I made some attempt to qualify this claim of equality in my first round. Quote from round 1 ""Though true equality is impossible due to differences in wealth, ability and personality, western civilisation is based on the assumption of equality in the eyes of the law."" So that is to say, a billionaire tycoon and a homeless junkie have in theory equal rights before a Judge. The issue of money distorts this equality, but equality it is a key aspiration. Islam places Men above women, Muslims above Christians. It is unequal and therefore conflicts with western values. I ask observers not to vote according to whether or not they like Islam, irrespective of their opinion on Islamic values, irrespective of the complex issues of terrorism, but purely on who has made the best argument. In conclusion Can it be assumed that should Muslims become a majority in Britain (or any other liberal western democracy) that the citizens of that country would continue to enjoy gender equality, democracy, freedom of religion and so forth. As no Islamic country enjoys all these rights I must suggest no.

I am just glad you are still here!  
  
My opponent states,  
""Although alcohol may be intrenched into western culture, my opponent fails to address that alcoholism can be a serious issue that can tear families apart, result in rapes, drunk driving.""  
  
Indeed it is sometimes remarked that were alcohol to be discovered today, it would have been immediately banned, along with hard recreational drugs. However it is an ancient part of my culture and civilisation, my right to drink it is part of civil liberties, my civil liberties are a key part of my culture and civilisation, the act of drinking is a key part of social interaction, so again key part of my culture and my civilisation.  
  
The fact that it may be harmful, the question of if I should or not consume it is a separate one. It does not actually have any relation to the resolution. For the same reason I will not bring up the issue of the health benefits of moderate alcoholic consumption nor the terrible human cost of organised crime that will be created by prohibition.  
  
Alcohol is part of my civilisation, if/when Muslims reach a majority in Britain it is likely that to be outlawed or restricted.  
  
On the issue of divorce,  
""While it's often the case that men can more easily divorce it's usually justified. Men traditionally have a higher income so are expected to provide for their wives.""  
  
The Koran does not state that it should be easier for the higher income earner to divorce the lower income earner. It simply states that the man has more rights than the woman. This is a clear gender imbalance, the two genders are not equal in the law. You may find ways to defend this sexual inequality, but nonetheless this does contradict with the western civilisations fundamental desire for gender equality in law.

358,"I thank Pro for his response. Before I begin, I must reject all of this ""10 and below"" talk. Young is defined as ""youthful"" or ""not old"" [1]; Pro clearly hoped to limit his culpability in this debate by reducing the population in question to a ridiculously small subset. That was a pointless exercise anyway, as the definition of role model explains that young people are especially impacted, not exclusively impacted. As such, I am free to discuss Batman's influence on any age range. My Case Gotham's Biggest Criminal Batman commits more crime on a given night than any of the petty crooks he hunts. That doesn't seem possible, but let's do the math. How many laws does Batman break during an investigation? At the very least, there are... Trespassing Breaking and entering Tampering with a crime scene Tampering with and/or theft of evidence Concealing and use of deadly weapons Public endangerment Assault and battery Kidnapping ...not to mention things like destruction of property, stalking, illegal surveillance, evading and resisting arrest, wiretapping, accessing confidential government and medical files, and innumerable violations for the illegal use of his specialized car, plane, motorcycle, and boat within city limits. Believe it or not, that's the petty stuff! He's also committed multiple cases of child endangerment, criminal negligence, attempted murder, and has been involved in multiple deaths. Thus, in his single-minded, violent, self-indulgent crusade to end crime, Batman has instead become its biggest spokesperson. He is the epitome of the ends not justifying the means, and to say that he and his methods should be applauded, even emulated, is hypocrisy. It is also incredibly dangerous, as an endorsement for Batman is an endorsement for vigilantism, violence, and vengeance. Why So Sociopathic? Imagine two orphans. After losing his entire family, the first was taken in by a couple of meager means. His poor upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic, while his compassion for life taught him to value honesty, fairness, and altruism. Despite having lost his home to tragedy and evil, he learned to trust the good in people and would grow up to bring peace and hope to others. The second orphan takes a different path. He also loses everything, but his thoughts festered on revenge and retribution for what he lost. Despite being born of privilege to kind-hearted parents, he learned to see only darkness in others. He later grows up to a world of self-imposed isolation and mistrust, bringing fear and violence to others. Aside from being portraits of Superman and Batman, respectively, these are also snapshots of a stable and unstable mindset. Batman is obsessive, antisocial, sociopathic, and extremely aggressive. He lost any semblance of normalcy and sanity the day his parents died. Now, rather than working through his issues calmly or using philanthropic means to fight crime, he literally lives in a cave, hides behind a mask, and beats up people who make him mad. There are few worse role models for emotional development than Batman. Worst. Babysitter. Ever. Since Pro emphasized children so much in his round, let's talk for a bit about Batman and kids. During his tenure, Batman has employed no less than 6 teens and pre-teens to work as side-kicks and allies, with at least three of which being his own biological or adopted children! You may be wondering why the number is so high when there is usually only one Robin. That's because most of them got messed up...bad [2]: Robin #1: Dick Grayson - Became obsessed with crime fighting; became Nightwing Robin #2: Jason Todd - Beaten with a crowbar by Joker, then killed in an explosion Robin #3: Tim Drake - Watched his father be murdered by super villains Robin #4: Stephanie Brown - Murdered by Black Mask Robin #5: Damian Wayne - Trained assassin; multiple murderer Batgirl #1: Barbara Gordon - Paralyzed by Joker Batgirl #2: Cassandra Cain - Trained assassin; multiple murderer Considering their ages ranged from 10-18 years old when their lives were ended, crippled, or forever changed by Batman's influence, Batman is personally responsible for each of these outcomes. He taught children to fight against murderers and madman and, of course, their lives were destroyed. This sends a very dangerous message to youths and paints a very clear picture about the kind of psychopath we're dealing with here. Counter-Arguments Batman is...a good guy? Pro's entire case can be summarized in one sentence: Batman is a good role model because he fights bad guys and sacrifices himself. Well, remember in The Dark Knight when Joker kills all those mobsters and bank robbers? Does that make him a good guy? How about at the end of the movie, when there are bombs strapped to a ferry full of criminals and one full of civilians. When that tattoo-faced murderer throws the detonator out the window to save the civilians, does that make him a good guy? Pro is confusing doing good with being good. Batman is a criminal who fights other criminals. This does not make him admirable. Batman vs. the Police Batman obviously works outside the law; that is the problem. The ""protocol and regulations"" Pro believes hinder police investigations are not arbitrary. They are in place to prevent reckless, insane, and criminally dangerous vigilantism the likes of which Batman practices on a daily basis. I agree that helping people can be considered an act of good. However, as enforcing and maintaining societal good is the work of the police force and Batman routinely and flippantly interferes with their operations, any independent good he does in the process becomes a double-edged sword.

Blind people wouldn't benefit from learning how to drive a manual transmission car, for instance. In fact, they would be a danger to others on the road."" >>This is a new point in your round 2 thus I have no choice but to answer your claim. As much as I hate new points in my final speech...... We should teach blind people to drive if only so that they may feel just as capable as other individuals. I however agree when you say that they would be a danger to others, thus we will teach them to drive but not allow them to actually do so. Onto the points. 1. You say perhaps it would have been a better idea if my girlfriend had worn a helmet. This is true, however what I am stating is the fact that learning how to drive a manual was just another safety precaution. You also state my phone may have been a better choice, and while I also agree with that, you have conceded the point. That being, driving a manual transmission can save yourself and others if all else fails. =) 2. My second point was avoiding the consequences for speeding. You obviously do not condone such an action as it is breaking the law. However breaking the law in itself is not always a bad thing and there are situation when it is necessary. Such as when someone kidnaps your child and drives away with him. Speeding in such a situation, at the very least to catch such criminals license plate, is necessary. You also state that officers are trained to notice such tricks but this truly does not matter. Unless you can somehow prove to me that a police officer will notice such a trick every single time, even with their special training, then it is still offers a benefit. As proving this would be impossible, it is still a benefit. 3. Here you say, ""This is a myth. Even four-wheel drive vehicles experience slips on icy roads."" I agree, all vehicles will experience some slipping on icy rodes, but this was not my argument. You have straw manned me. My argument quite clearly stated, ""Avoids slipping on ice."" not ""stops slipping on ice"". You also do not attack the crux of this argument being, ""in a manual transmission one can simply down shift to make the wheels spin slightly slower thereby slowing down"" which is where my entire point stems from and thereby my argument still stands in this round. Manual transmissions avoid slipping on ice, and thereby can avoid wrecks. 4. You have me here when you say, ""An automatic Ford Mustang could easily win in a race over a manual Toyota Corolla."" However this still stands as a minor benefit to me as a manual ford mustang would own an automatic ford mustang. I also do not condone racing, that would be a bad idea. I'm just saying in the off chance that one has to race. For instance if my cat was being held hostage and the only way I could get it back was by racing the crazy lady who had stolen it. This would be an acceptable situation to race in. 5. Once again you have me here for the most part. But I can tell you from experience that I look more cool driving a manual. As do select members around the community. I would also contest that such people as dorks and geeks, while still being dork and geeks, are more cool looking for driving a manual than they would for driving an automatic. However since neither of us could prove this point we will consider it moot and just call me cool when I drive a manual. 6. On this point you concede the fact that it can be a bonding experience while stating that it can also be very expensive. Thus I ask our audience and respectable voters. What is more important, relationships with people you love or money? The answer is quite obvious, bonding time is quite a bit more important than money will ever be. Finally you bring up some new points at the end. You say that driving a manual is not necessary however I have already proved how it can be necessary and potentially life threatening to not in at least 3 scenarios above. You the state, ""Also, I don't know how I feel about all physically challenged or mentally challenged people learning to drive manual transmission cars. I think some people are better suited to walking or public transportation."" I agree with you here but must advocate the same as I did for blind people. They should be taught so they might feel capable but never be allowed to drive. Your very final point is as follows, ""It should remain as it is now -- something to learn if one is interested."" And I must thank you for such a point, I would like to redirect everyone to the resolution which quite clearly states, ""Everyone should learn to drive manual transmission cars at some point in life."" This says ""should"" learn, not must learn, or it is imperative. I have brought many reasons why people ""should"" learn to drive a manual but I would not force it as some kind of imperative. My opponent seems to think that I am advocating against free will here. My advocacy however is exactly as my opponent states. It is something to learn if one is interested. There are many reasons one should learn such a thing but it still only something to do if one is interested. Free will ftw! Thanks for the debate Solo.",1,Yraelz,"
  
Alright, I will being my final round by attacking the few atrocious claims you have put forward and then moving on to the 6 points.  
  
""There are benefits for some, but not everyone. Blind people wouldn't benefit from learning how to drive a manual transmission car, for instance. In fact, they would be a danger to others on the road.""  
  
>>This is a new point in your round 2 thus I have no choice but to answer your claim. As much as I hate new points in my final speech...... We should teach blind people to drive if only so that they may feel just as capable as other individuals. I however agree when you say that they would be a danger to others, thus we will teach them to drive but not allow them to actually do so.  
  
Onto the points.  
  
1. You say perhaps it would have been a better idea if my girlfriend had worn a helmet. This is true, however what I am stating is the fact that learning how to drive a manual was just another safety precaution. You also state my phone may have been a better choice, and while I also agree with that, you have conceded the point. That being, driving a manual transmission can save yourself and others if all else fails. =)

I believe the morality behind this ideology is corrupted and misses the true goal and design of justice. But, it goes on, 'it is necessary that society should avenge the victims, that society should punish.' - Neither: To avenge is of the individual, to punish is of God, and Society/law/justice is between the two in the hiearchy. Society's duty is to correct and ameliorate. Not to punish, and not to avenge. You treat crime as a malady, as a sickness. That's the right way to do it. But the sickness, or the cancer as you put it, doesn't reside in the criminal or in the crime he has commited, but instead resides on the origin of the crime, or in other words the motives of the person and what has lead that said person to commit murder, steal etc. Crime has always existed. And it still exists. It's clear that we are dealing with crime the wrong way, focalizing on the crime instead of the source of the crime. Because this is where your analogy goes wrong: research done on medicine, and the scientific breakthroughs achieved in that field aren't to develop new ways to physically extract cancer from the body, they are done to develop ways of eradicating the source of the disease altogther, to make us immune from it, to heal us from it. Sickness has to be treated with care, with attention, and most importantly it must be studied thoroughly, it has to have its source identified, eradicated. Our readers must have noticed by now that I am centering the debate on not the crime or the criminals themselves, but on the source of the said crime, because it is a requirement in order for us to eradicate crime. Just like how you deal with sickness in medicine, you have to go to a prison, and observe the inclination of each prisoner, gather data, understand why person A was lead to murder that innocent civilian, or why person B had to steal from that store. Are criminals actually guilty, or is it that the society itself is guilty? Because yes, society itself bears a part of guilt whenever an innocent civilian has been murdered. Fact is: poverty and misery leads to crime, and to get rid of crime is to get rid of poverty. Poverty is justice denied: this needs to change. (1 & 2). No matter how many people you hang, crime is never going to stop, because the problem lies on society and on government, and not on the individuals themselves. To kill an individual for something he has no power over is senseless, defies the bases of justice, and is straight up barbary!

For example if your girlfriend fell and got a concussion, you would be able to drive her home. (Real life example from me!)

You know that day when you're late for work and you're going 10 mph over the speed limit to get there. Then you see that cop coming down the street at you, now all you have to do is down shift. No incriminating break lights or anything. Good idea! 3. Avoids slipping on ice. Where as an automatic transmission in many instances must apply break in order to slow down, in a manual transmission one can simply down shift to make the wheels spin slightly slower thereby slowing down. This avoids sliding on ice and can prevent wrecks. 4. They are so much more fun. A person who can drive a manual better owns any automatic at race. Manuals can stay in gear for as long as possible thereby revving higher and accelerating faster. Automatics simply flip when they hit so many rpms. This is obnoxious. 5. Everybody looks more cool driving a manual. You know it the moment you get in a car with someone who has one of those nice leather stick shifts they are most definitely a cool person. Manuals are cool to drive, drivers are cool. 6. Learning to drive a manual can be a bonding experience with someone you like. Just have one of your good friends teach you, bonding time, yeah!

Those points being my slippery slope argument, the argument against the family, the argument of separation of state marriages and church marriages. Starting on your points however, economically you have stated that with any economic benefit the government has a duty to peruse this benefit within reason. Here you have nearly the right the economic benefit and the cost for that benefit should go up by percentile, so for a negligible increase in economic benefit only a negligible cost or less can be accepted. The cost of passing this law is not negligible as shown by the controversy and unrest it has caused throughout society so justifying that due to economic benefits is deployable. Also I took another look through your resources to find out where these costs are being cut. And it""s through medical assistance funding. So by giving them their right to marry you also take funded health care in order to justify your economic benefit that is not just. You then question my use of the American deficit and as I stated when in my essay I am not blaming the increase on this law. I am merely putting into perspective these benefits you are basing your arguments off. My opponent then goes on to defend his sources stating, in a rather muddled fashion, that his bias news platform has referenced unbiased studies. However, you are still working off the information presented in a bias fashion so the numbers you are quoting are put there to push a narrative. That cannot stand and thus I have won the economic argument The other argument you brought forward which I refuted and then expanded upon was the idea of an innate characteristic. Now we both agree that being gay is a genetically defined characteristic fine but you say that because it defined like that it makes it 100% likely that they will turn out gay to which I told you that that isn""t biology so there is one flaw in your argument. Here is another, just because something is defined about your character doesn""t mean that you cannot be discriminated against for it I used the example of a psychopath who through his genetics was destined to become a psychopath. This is similar to the Gay argument because like we both agreed Gay people are ""destined"" to become such. So by dismissing my point because it is not ""appropriate"" is deplorable from the person who has been attacking not only my intelligence but using slander to personally attack my grammatical structures, so when voting please take consider this manipulation of the rules. So to finish this point on an imperial standpoint, when considering whether or not something needs to be written in law you must consider the morality and riotousness of what passing, or nullifying, a law will do. In this case more harm than good. Now the matter of the Church having no right to decide the law. Which yes is correct but vice versa the law has no power to supress the beliefs of the church. That is discriminating against a person""s beliefs which is something that I am assuming my opponent will admit is horrid. Under my model with two separate licenses one for the church a marriage under the lord and the other a union under the state this will get rid of all your discrimination arguments and sole the problems both sides of the table have put forward. My opponent then challenged my argument of the reason for marriage quoting the bible and a source that lead me to a Family Life page. Which yes was posted in the comments but I will still honour as I did similarly last round. You state using one specific quote that it claims god""s only purpose for marriage is love but that very website talks all about families and how marriage will grow a family that will grow your faith in the lord. I.E. the point of marriage by your own source is for creating a stable family. Finally, he states the main problem this moot brings forward that changing the law will require a change in position of the church. But it does people generally think of marriage as a thing that is ordained by a priest in a chapel not a slip of paper issues by the state. This is the Equivalence problem we face and why I tried to separate the two terms earlier. But as it stands it will force the church to change its standpoint. So it is plain to see that Gay Marriage should not be legalised as I have stated many times the cost of forcing people to change their beliefs is not outweighed by the economic benefits or the social benefits. instead we should follow a different course of action like I have stated from the beginning that we separate this gay union from marriage to fix the problem while not causing unnecessary social tensions.

384,"Rebuttals 1. ""SAT's give the school systems access to each student's achievement over the years."" Standardized tests are taken on one day out of a year. This day may not be a good judgement of the skills the student has. I, for example, took the Pre-ACT (which is required in my state) after getting a concussion. It is well documented that SATs are not a good judge of a student's skills. A single test score at a young age that shows below average skills may cause a student to be placed in a Special Education program, which are programs that cause a habit cycle that children rarely escape from. This, of course, harms their future. Furthermore, selection based on these programs is racially influenced, as well as influenced by district, breeding disparity. The test scores also can cause a child to be held back a year, which often does not lead to better preformance than the first year in year two. [1] 2. ""SATs are not expensive at all, and only cost $7 per student"". While it may be true that the required tests taken by students are not particularly expensive, the cost of them is often not even worth what the tests will give to the student. There is no evidence that testing actually improves students scores [2] - in fact, in countries like Finland, where standardized tests have been eradicated have had higher test scores [3] than other countries. 3. ""SAT's show how well a teacher is teaching a certain material."" Unfortunately, the idea that a teacher will be judged based off test scores leads to a way of teaching that is detrimental towards the student. Often the teacher teaches to what the child will be tested on, not in the best interest of the student. Of course, this breeds a variety of teaching in the U.S.A. I like to call ""taught to know, not to learn"". [4] 4. ""SAT's are good to practice because you have to pass them to become such professions as a pilot, lawyer, etc.."" While that is true, to get into a program like becoming a pilot, lawyer, doctor, whatever else, you will have graduated from college, which almost always makes it necessary to have taken the SAT (not just a general Standardized Test, to be clear, the one that is taken by juniors out of 2200 points) and/or the ACT, which is good practice. Furthermore, optional Standardized tests would mean that students where practice in Standardized tets would be beneficial could take the tests, but where it wouldn't be (ex., I have a friend who has epilepsy and violently seizes upon taking any SATs from stress - I too am an epileptic, and tend to have seizures, though much less minor, during tests of that kind) they wouldn't have to take it. 5. ""SATs show what level a student is at."" In essence this is just a restatement of #1. 6. ""SATs strengthen test taking skills for young ones."" This too is basically a restatement, but I will still point out that it teaches bad skills, such as completing tests in the time limit, sitting in stressful rooms worrying, being taught that these tests are absolutely imperative to your life (which freaks children out), and being given bad mediums for preparing.

388,"Thanks, Con. It seems my opponent has already argued against and subsequently defeated his own case. ""Despite highly extensive differences, people all have that common ground [credo] ... I advocate a world government which is strong, and prudently federalized, yet gentle, in that any country may opt out of it. If such and such a country does not like the law of the land, they're free to either leave the law or leave the land."" What Con has just described does not at all fit the criteria of a world government. The definition we have established is a single, unified government that everyone in the world is expected to abide by. If people can ""opt out"" of the government, then not everyone is following the same rules of order. Con pointed out that everyone despite their differences wants to establish laws, so by acknowledging that various communities will establish their own laws, he has repeated exactly what I said in the last round. I pointed out that various governments will inevitably form. Con agrees. As such, this dismantles the notion of a single and unified world government. What Con is describing is the peaceful coexistence of multiple governments, with perhaps a unified system of order that overrides (or should override) them all - say like an institution resembling the United Nations. In this organization, many governments are represented. While each country's power and influence over this organization is certainly not equal, it's naive and idealistic to assume that this would be the case in whatever utopia Con proposes. There will inevitably be a particular group who is more powerful or influential, and that will probably be based on wealth (resources) though there may be other factors. Regardless, the point here is that Con hasn't advocated for an actual world government. He's advocated for the allowance of various groups to form their own governments or opt out of the alleged ""world"" government. Con asks what would necessarily make a world government oppressive. If people could ""opt out"" of the government, then of course it wouldn't be oppressive. However, it also wouldn't be a world government! What this sounds like is a variation of anarcho-capitalism -- a system where property rights are acknowledged, but everyone is free to live their life according to their own values/laws within their given territory. Anarcho-capitalism supposes - as my opponent does - the right for people to govern themselves by opting into a system of governance that appeals to their values. On the contrary, a world government would be inherently oppressive because people would have no choice but to follow the singular law of the land. As I said in R2, a government's rules are usually upheld by law enforcement - the police or military. If there was only a singular legitimate authority with a monopoly on force (as a world government implies), then oppression is evident. However that is not what Con proposes. To be sure that my supposition of what qualifies as a world government isn't off base, I'll refer to Wikipedia's definition and my opponent can feel free to challenge it. He can and perhaps should go into more detail about what this government should entail in the next round. After all, saying it should be ""strong yet gentle"" is still completely vague and ambiguous. ""A world government is the notion of a single common political authority for all of humanity. As of 2012 , there is no functioning global international military, executive, legislature, judiciary or constitution with jurisdiction over the entire planet"" [1]. I'm assuming that in advocating a world government, Con supposes that there should be. However Con concludes his last round by suggesting, ""Every country should have a voice, and no country should be forced to participate in a world government."" If a world government is optional, there is room for other governments a.k.a. no world government - no singular authority with world jurisdiction. Con has defeated his own argument; a world government is fundamentally not a good idea. [1] <URL>...",1,Danielle,"

He's advocated for the allowance of various groups to form their own governments or opt out of the alleged ""world"" government.   Con asks what would necessarily make a world government oppressive. If people could ""opt out"" of the government, then of course it wouldn't be oppressive. However, it also wouldn't be a world government! What this sounds like is a variation of anarcho-capitalism -- a system where property rights are acknowledged, but everyone is free to live their life according to their own values/laws within their given territory. Anarcho-capitalism supposes - as my opponent does - the right for people to govern themselves by opting into a system of governance that appeals to their values. On the contrary, a world government would be inherently oppressive because people would have no choice but to follow the singular law of the land. As I said in R2, a government's rules are usually upheld by law enforcement - the police or military. If there was only a singular legitimate authority with a monopoly on force (as a world government implies), then oppression is evident. However that is not what Con proposes.   To be sure that my supposition of what qualifies as a world government isn't off base, I'll refer to Wikipedia's definition and my opponent can feel free to challenge it. He can and perhaps should go into more detail about what this government should entail in the next round. After all, saying it should be ""strong yet gentle"" is still completely vague and ambiguous. ""A world government   is the notion of a single common political   authority for all of humanity.   As of 2012  , there is no functioning global international military, executive, legislature, judiciary or constitution   with jurisdiction over the entire planet"" [1]. I'm assuming that in advocating a world government, Con supposes that there   should   be. However Con concludes his last round by suggesting,   ""Every country should have a voice, and no country should be forced to participate in a world government."" If a world government is optional, there is room for other governments a.k.a. no world government - no singular authority with world jurisdiction.   Con has defeated his own argument; a world government is fundamentally not a good idea.  [1]   http://en.wikipedia.org...",Politics,2,A-World-Government-is-fundamentally-not-a-good-idea./1/,958

""Better"" Definitions Like I said, I view these definitions as somewhat ambiguous and confusing, so I'm going to clarify them: Gnostic pertains to the position of knowledge that the belief or disbelief in a divine being (i.e. God) is true. An agnostic is someone who holds the position that one does not know wether the belief or disbelief in a divine being is true. Theism, on the other hand, is the belief in the existence of a divine being (i.e. God), where as atheism is the disbelief that God exists. Literally, atheism means ""without theism"" so it's the lack of belief in God. As you can see, gonstic/agnostic pertains to the knowledge about the truth of a belief whereas theism/atheism pertains to the belief about the existence of God. One addresses knowledge, the other belief, therefore we can conflate not only atheism and a/gnostisism, but theism and a/gnostisism: Agnostic Gnostic Atheist Agnostic atheist believes that no god exists, but doesn't claim to know that this belief is true. Gnostic atheist believes that no god exists and claims to know that this belief is true. Theist Agnoistic theist believes a god exists, but doesn't claim to know that this belief is true. Gnostic theist believes a god exists and claims to know that this is true. A more detailed explanation of these terms and how they are combined can be found on the iron chariots website: <URL>... If the table below is too complicated to understand, then I present the following venn diagram (from wikipedia <URL>... ): My opponent's statement, that a ""presumption which seems to combine atheism with agnosticism re-defines 'Atheism' to indicate merely the absence of belief in God,"" is therefore refuted. Atheism is, by definition, the absence of belief in God. When the terms gnosticism/agnosticism are used, we can get a more granular understanding about what a person is claiming as their knowledge with respect to a belief. I don't understand what my opponent is trying to say when he suggests that an atheist has to prove if God existed, when the atheist does not believe that a God exists. If the atheist were to prove that God exists, then he/she would probably not be an atheist anymore. Other Arguments At the end of the first round my opponent states: ""Never mind these questions for now, the topic of debate before us is simply the merging of any form of agnosticism (the claim to no knowledge, which therefore demands no justification) with Atheism (the claim to knowledge, which therefore demands justification) immediately downplays Atheism's claim to fit with and actually be agnosticism. To say I simply lack belief in God' is just a biographical statement, no more."" I'm not going to address any of the other claims, since my opponent also suggest we only address the resolution at hand. However, I would address the point of justification and that is simply: atheism is the lack of belief, therefore the only justification that is necessary is based on the lack of evidence to warrant a belief. In other words: the burden of proof is on the person who takes the affirmative position. Conclusion As I have demonstrated, agnosticism pertains to the knowledge about the truth of a belief, whereas atheism pertains to a belief (or lack thereof). Conflating the two is not a redefinition of atheism, but rather a classification of the ""levels"" of knowledge about the lack of belief in a God.

The child doesn't have a choice though, it's not his fault the girl had sex when she was 16. Sex may feel good but it comes with risks, I'm sure people could resist sex for the sake of them and for the sake of the baby. The baby never had a choice but you have the choice of getting the right size condom(condoms are most efficient when you actually try them out and see which size actually fits) or birth control or both. Killing someone without their choice and they haven't even lived outside of the womb yet, is not okay. 3. You can't predict things, you can't predict how the babies life will go. People like Bill Clinton and Marilyn Monroe and other celebrities were either adopted or reached the age of 18 and went out of foster care. Saying the child might have a bad life is not a valid reason. Also pro-life people do care, most of them at least.

1.Heart to heart will help pay your bills depending on your financial situation, the more poor you are the more they'll help. They also offer free housing and the fate of the child.  
  
2. The child doesn't have a choice though, it's not his fault the girl had sex when she was 16. Sex may feel good but it comes with risks, I'm sure people could resist sex for the sake of them and for the sake of the baby. The baby never had a choice but you have the choice of getting the right size condom(condoms are most efficient when you actually try them out and see which size actually fits) or birth control or both. Killing someone without their choice and they haven't even lived outside of the womb yet, is not okay.  
  
3. You can't predict things, you can't predict how the babies life will go. People like Bill Clinton and Marilyn Monroe and other celebrities were either adopted or reached the age of 18 and went out of foster care. Saying the child might have a bad life is not a valid reason. Also pro-life people do care, most of them at least.

Lets get to rap, go n' claim i look like a girl, it's not a proven fact

like how you love to hang with drugs n' hookers when you wastin all that dough (1)  
  
Tell us about how you associate every generic girl with your ex-girlfriend (2)

Cussin' her out, degradin' women, call it ""movin on"", onto the next friend  
Me n' GCL are ascendin' to heaven, ex gave you hell so don't transcend  
  
Talk about when i got maimed by a white dame (3), call me the lame  
I would ignite a flame, inflict pain on you if there was a name to shame  
No one's ever heard of you, before you blow my brain, get some fame  
  
At least i realize that there is no such thing as romantic chivalry  
While you screwed up thinkin' she loved you n' mope in misery

It has no relevance to the resolution and i will explain: 1) Humans don't have free-will 2) God controls all human actions and can still exist Whether or not we have free-will is unimportant, it still doesn't disprove God's existence, but i will address these points anyways. ""Free Will: Many disagree on what free will is, which is fine, but there is agreement on what free is not. If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will."" Like i said, i will use my previous definition. You fail to establish of free-will, but explain what free-will is not. ""P2: Problem Of Free Will(Non-gods): P1)An omniscient god knows the future. P2) An omniscient god can't be wrong. P3) An omniscient god can predict your actions and can't be wrong. P4)An omniscient god knows your actions. C1) You don't have free will."" There is a difference between knowing your future actions and influencing the course of your actions. Hypothetically, lets say that I know your going to get hit by a car tomorrow but do i have to take action and warn you? No, do you have free-will to cross the street not being aware of an incoming car? Yes. Same way with God. God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2-3) knowing that they would sin, but allowing them to choose between good or evil. ""P1) good is whatever god wants P2) Bad is which opposes god. P3)god can't do what he does not want C) God is always good. This proposal of Divine Command Theory renders all morality completely trivial. If there is a tri-omni god, morality is so trivially that it does not exist."" the purpose of the Christian God is to show us as moral beings who can distinguish between right and wrong (Gen. 3:22) how to be more like God himself. ""P1) If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will. P2) An omnipotent god has free will P3) An omniscient god can know his actions with 100% accuracy C1) An omnipotent god can't be omniscient, because omniscience entails no free will, because then god could 100% predict his own actions(which means he also is not omnipotent, because then he can't predict his actions) C2) The only way a tri-omni god can have free will is if he does not have omnipotence or omniscience, thus no longer being tri-omni"" Your arguments seem very confusing. You speak of how we don't have free-will, but then switch back to God's own free-will. Your 1st conclusion is false because it does not follow that an omniscient God has no free-will and i will explain: Omniscience co-exists with omnipotence. In my previous example, if i knew that you were going to get hit by a car tomorrow, that foreknowledge gives me the ability to either prevent that from happening or allowing it. Your argument then breaks down. ""P1) God must always act for the greater good, since he is omnibenevolent. P2) An omnipotent god can act in a way contrary to the greater good C) Omnipotence and Omnibenevolence are incompatabile "" 1) You strayed from the definitions i set and introduced a concept called ""the greater good"" 2) I never said that God can act in contrary to the greater good, i said that all good is subject to God's laws. Let me repeat what i said: ""whatever God considers ""good"" and ""evil"" is subject to his interpretation, not yours. If God sees it best for you to suffer in order to discover the fullest power of good in a world of evil then that is ""good."" All of God's commandments and Jesus are expressions of God's definition of divine goodness, thus we can only know what he considers good or necessary based on these things.

If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will.""  
  
Like i said, i will use my previous definition. You fail to establish of free-will, but explain what free-will is not.  
  
""P2: Problem Of Free Will(Non-gods):  
P1)An omniscient god knows the future.  
P2) An omniscient god can't be wrong.  
P3) An omniscient god can predict your actions and can't be wrong.  
P4)An omniscient god knows your actions.  
C1) You don't have free will.""  
  
There is a difference between knowing your future actions and influencing the course of your actions. Hypothetically, lets say that I know your going to get hit by a car tomorrow but do i have to take action and warn you? No, do you have free-will to cross the street not being aware of an incoming car? Yes. Same way with God. God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2-3) knowing that they would sin, but allowing them to choose between good or evil.  
  
""P1) good is whatever god wants  
P2) Bad is which opposes god.  
P3)god can't do what he does not want  
C) God is always good.  
  
This proposal of Divine Command Theory renders all morality completely trivial. If there is a tri-omni god, morality is so trivially that it does not exist.""  
  
the purpose of the Christian God is to show us as moral beings who can distinguish between right and wrong (Gen. 3:22) how to be more like God himself.  
  
""P1) If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will.  
P2) An omnipotent god has free will  
P3) An omniscient god can know his actions with 100% accuracy  
C1) An omnipotent god can't be omniscient, because omniscience entails no free will, because then god could 100% predict his own actions(which means he also is not omnipotent, because then he can't predict his actions)  
C2) The only way a tri-omni god can have free will is if he does not have omnipotence or omniscience, thus no longer being tri-omni""  
  
Your arguments seem very confusing. You speak of how we don't have free-will, but then switch back to God's own free-will. Your 1st conclusion is false because it does not follow that an omniscient God has no free-will and i will explain:  
  
Omniscience co-exists with omnipotence. In my previous example, if i knew that you were going to get hit by a car tomorrow, that foreknowledge gives me the ability to either prevent that from happening or allowing it. Your argument then breaks down.  
  
""P1) God must always act for the greater good, since he is omnibenevolent.  
P2) An omnipotent god can act in a way contrary to the greater good  
C) Omnipotence and Omnibenevolence are incompatabile ""  
  
1) You strayed from the definitions i set and introduced a concept called ""the greater good"" 2) I never said that God can act in contrary to the greater good, i said that all good is subject to God's laws. Let me repeat what i said:  
  
""whatever God considers ""good"" and ""evil"" is subject to his interpretation, not yours. If God sees it best for you to suffer in order to discover the fullest power of good in a world of evil then that is ""good.""  
  
All of God's commandments and Jesus are expressions of God's definition of divine goodness, thus we can only know what he considers good or necessary based on these things.  
  
Conclusion: God exists and is coherent in his omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience",Religion,2,The-Christian-God-Does-Not-Exist/8/,58362

425,"I will now respond to my opponent. 1st Rebuttal: I was quoting what seemed to be your main points and then refuting them. Yes, this is a common tactic in debate. I also did my best to interpret your arguments in the last round. 2nd and 3rd Rebuttal: Again, I will restate my alternative. If the ones who are priting the software are found guilty, then they will suffer an even harsher blow to their reputation. Many ofthem would lose their jobs. Should no justice be served because of poor justice in the country of which the University is in, then internation trade could be used as a weapon to pressure the justice. Specifically 2nd: Therefore, the best way to ruin the respect of the software pirates is to make ruin their public image in this mattter rather than ban them from this debate. Specifically 3rd: ""The opposition's proposal of firing and fining, would only work in countries that have very little corruption. Not only that, but how does the opposition deal with the perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people? The opposition has no idea how to fix the problem!"" To restate the point above, international infamy decreases the likelihood of a potential student looking into attending that particular university. This alone would apply pressure against corrupt universities. 4th Rebuttal: My proposal of an international embargo was for the countries who refuse to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy. This is not a contradiction becuase it is not group punishment; it is the punishment solely of those responsible. My proposal that a university not be further punished after all of the guilty ones are removed was directed at such governments that do investigate, discourage, and incriminate software pirates. An embargo on those ""perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people"" would peacefully pressure those governments to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy. 5th Rebuttal: Again, you are arguing my point. The resolution of preventing priating universities from attending this debate does not target the pirates and only hurts the best of the student body that would be participating in this debate. 6th Rebuttal: Correct! Both the PRO and CON agree that pirating software is bad and harmful in many ways. This is a neutral argument. The debate is not over whether piracy is bad and has negative effects; it is over whether or not software-pirating universities should be allowed at the Cork debates. 1st clash: ""The United Kingdom has decided to stop all trade, and will begin patrols effective immediately.""

If this piracy movement continues and expands, it could eventually lead to a depression. Therefore, piracy must be stopped. My recap of this debate: 1.

It is even clearer that banning the universites will not discourage piracy, and other methods are more appropriate. For these reasons, you have no choice but to vote CON.",1,wjmelements,"
  
I will now respond to my opponent.  
1st Rebuttal:  
I was quoting what seemed to be your main points and then refuting them. Yes, this is a common tactic in debate. I also did my best to interpret your arguments in the last round.  
  
2nd and 3rd Rebuttal:  
Again, I will restate my alternative. If the ones who are priting the software are found guilty, then they will suffer an even harsher blow to their reputation. Many ofthem would lose their jobs. Should no justice be served because of poor justice in the country of which the University is in, then internation trade could be used as a weapon to pressure the justice.  
  
Specifically 2nd:  
Therefore, the best way to ruin the respect of the software pirates is to make ruin their public image in this mattter rather than ban them from this debate.  
  
Specifically 3rd:  
""The opposition's proposal of firing and fining, would only work in countries that have very little corruption. Not only that, but how does the opposition deal with the perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people? The opposition has no idea how to fix the problem!""  
To restate the point above, international infamy decreases the likelihood of a potential student looking into attending that particular university. This alone would apply pressure against corrupt universities.  
  
4th Rebuttal:  
My proposal of an international embargo was for the countries who refuse to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy. This is not a contradiction becuase it is not group punishment; it is the punishment solely of those responsible. My proposal that a university not be further punished after all of the guilty ones are removed was directed at such governments that do investigate, discourage, and incriminate software pirates. An embargo on those ""perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people"" would peacefully pressure those governments to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy.  
  
5th Rebuttal:  
  
Again, you are arguing my point. The resolution of preventing priating universities from attending this debate does not target the pirates and only hurts the best of the student body that would be participating in this debate.  
  
6th Rebuttal:  
Correct! Both the PRO and CON agree that pirating software is bad and harmful in many ways. This is a neutral argument. The debate is not over whether piracy is bad and has negative effects; it is over whether or not software-pirating universities should be allowed at the Cork debates.  
  
1st clash:  
""The United Kingdom has decided to stop all trade, and will begin patrols effective immediately.""  
The embargo proposal was for countries that do not punish piracy. The U. K. does.   http://bigblog.com...  
A country would not stop all trade, just all trade with a select few countries. Also, note that it does work in third world countries as an economic burden: ""Isolating/sanctioning has worked in Libya and North Korea, just to name a few.""  
  
Side note:

""In the government's case, nobody dies or gets hit with a phosphorous grenade; they are just prevented from attending a prestigious event."" Or is it me? What country?  
Back to the debate.  
  
2nd Clash:  
  
a) No one government will go around the world policing everybody. Each country will be responsibe for its own pirates. Those who do not show this responsibitily will be sanctioned against until they do.  
  
b) If there are many other debates, then not being able to go to the Cork one will not effect the decision of any debate club sponsors of whether or not to fund the club. The university just won't go to that one and go on with its merry way. No behavior will be changed.

""The government wants to use isolation as a way to change inappropriate behavior. The government has shown that it works at a global level. The government has also shown that the good of the many out-weighs the suffering of the few.""

Britain promised to open a second front in 1942, yet failed to do so. Then Churchill said he would open a second front in France in 1943, and once again failed to do so. While the Western Allies stood on the sidelines until 11 months before the war ended, the Soviet were killing Germans in the millions on the eastern front.

I am a graduate student that regularly writes 25-30 page papers on these kinds of topics, to summarize it in 40,000 characters would be doing injustice to a complex topic, so I am refraining from doing so."" In a debate, its the arguments that matter, not whether some one is a graduate student who regularly writes papers. In other words your own personal life is not a substitute for a good argument. You made a claim, I made an objection to it, you don't want to defend YOUR claim, that's your problem not mine. Con says ""Your argument that ""Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable"" is based entirely on you refuting substitutionary atonement"" Yes, I elaborate on this in round 1 where I had said......... ""Elaboration on what it means that ""Jesus died for our/your sins"" I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........ 1) Everyone is a sinner 2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness 3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners"" Con says in the previous rounds ""However, I would like to point out that Pro still has not fulfilled his burden of proof in showing that the Penal Substitution Atonement that he is objecting to is actually the way the Bible presents the function of the death of Christ on the Cross."" I ask Con to explain why they think that I need to prove the bible presents penal atonement theory or ANY atonement theory for that matter, in order for me to object to penal atonement. My objections are based on a moral ground and reasoning, not on what the bible says, or the quran, or an episode of the simpsons. Con says ""Was Con able to show these objections ere false and or unwarranted? Yes, Con showed that a system where the guilty are pardoned by the executive officer of the jurisdiction is not rejected out of hand, which is the second part of your argument.

Con says ""Second, you characterize my use of the word Metaphysics incorrectly. You state that it is simply me using a word to allow for contradiction, which is untrue. 8000 Characters is not a lot of space.

In a debate, its the arguments that matter, not whether some one is a graduate student who regularly writes papers. In other words your own personal life is not a substitute for a good argument. You made a claim, I made an objection to it, you don't want to defend YOUR claim, that's your problem not mine.  
  
Con says ""Your argument that ""Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable"" is based entirely on you refuting substitutionary atonement"" Yes, I elaborate on this in round 1 where I had said.........  
  
""Elaboration on what it means that ""Jesus died for our/your sins""  
  
I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........  
1) Everyone is a sinner  
2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness  
3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners""  
  
Con says in the previous rounds ""However, I would like to point out that Pro still has not fulfilled his burden of proof in showing that the Penal Substitution Atonement that he is objecting to is actually the way the Bible presents the function of the death of Christ on the Cross.""  
  
I ask Con to explain why they think that I need to prove the bible presents penal atonement theory or ANY atonement theory for that matter, in order for me to object to penal atonement.  
  
My objections are based on a moral ground and reasoning, not on what the bible says, or the quran, or an episode of the simpsons.  
  
Con says ""Was Con able to show these objections ere false and or unwarranted? Yes, Con showed that a system where the guilty are pardoned by the executive officer of the jurisdiction is not rejected out of hand, which is the second part of your argument.

On Counter-Factuals. A counter-factual, when given in a logical argument may save the validity of the argument, but not the soundness, as a counter-factual is by its very nature a false premise. A counter-factual is a problem because it purports a conclusion to be true based on a premise that is false. The form is not merely ""If X, then Y"" but rather, ""If X, then it WOULD be the case Y."" While not far apart, the two are indeed distinct. Consider: 1. If Nazi Germany had won WWII, the Allies would have lost. 2. If Nazi Germany had won WWII, Hitler would not have committed suicide. The two are distinct in that the first conclusion is a function of the premise. It's basically the following argument: (N v A) - this is an exclusive or...

Consider: Some unicorns are gray unicorns. All gray unicorns have mud on them. (Suppose too, that only gray unicorns have mud on them... keep it simple). Therefore, some unicorns have mud on them. Since no unicorns exist, the first premise is false, the logical implication being (by contradiction) that no unicorns are gray unicorns. If this is the case, then the statement that all gray unicorns have mud on them makes no sense because there ARE no gray unicorns. On top of that, the conclusion is false, because there are no gray unicorns that can have mud on them. Thus, to consider the argument, it introduces a counter-factual: If there were unicorns, some would be gray unicorns. All gray unicorns have mud on them.

Therefore, there is no need for a high school to offer more languages. I rest my case. ",Education,1,More-Foreign-Languages-should-be-taught-offered-in-High-Schools/2/,37487

Also it gives white people a unfair advantage into getting into college. For example, this is a white Student that tries very hard in school and gets A's and B's every year and their a Latino student who does okay in school and gets C's and some B's.

Even though though people do have to go through that, the point is that you are still expecting me to be okay with killing an innocent life 2.Like I stated earlier there is a risk but not a high one. I also stated there wouldn't be any risks if both partners just decide to not have sex in the first place. If you want to have sex do it for a child and if you're not be aware of the risks, but that doesn't mean that if the condom broke that someone else should suffer because of it. You're killing the baby primarily for yourself and that's a selfish act. Also if someone was impregnated with a condom and birth control, how long ago was this? She could have not taken it in a while, he could have had the wrong size condom or both or she lied for attention. 3. You just said we kill animals for food and our convince, a lot similar to abortion huh? Also comparing humans with animals is not correct. That's why there is a law that makes it possible for farmers to kill animals and for humans to kill other humans. 4. Again that's $300,000 dollars over 18 years, that's a long time. Also if you don't want the kid put them up for adoption. It is true adoption is more expensive than abortion but not by much. Ranging for $200-$1000 5. Read point number 4 6. Well if the mother has cancer or any other diseases she shouldn't have sex and should know the risks it comes with. Also the chance of dying while giving birth is less than 1% in america, specially if the mother has matured. 7. I was waiting for you to bring up that point, about 0.3%-0.6% of abortions are because of rape. That is less than 1%. Are you willing to add a law that calls for the murder of babies because less than 1% were raped. Obviously I'm not blaming the ones who got raped, of course not, but they should consider adoption. If they're life is in danger and she might die from giving birth, then I guess in extreme cases like these abortion should be an option. In a situation like this either the mother or the baby will end up dying, and I'm sure you'll agree with me it is more important to save the mother, but remember my point, less 1% of abortions are because of rape and less 1% of births end up in a death. Responses to your extra arguments 1. Actually no, the fetus can feel pain as early as 8 weeks and if younger(most abortions happen with a suctions that rips the baby to pieces) the fetus will sense the suction and danger and will move around attempting to escape. 2. Read the end of point 7 3.Not an abortion issue but I'll discuss it. Rape is bad, period, and I think we need to make everyone know that they're never at fault and should always tell, but if they don't tell, how are we to know. Also, I personally think in most cases of rape, the rapist should be given the death penalty, this will probably lower rape numbers, probably I'm no expert. Again if an eleven year old girl was raped AND got pregnant (not very likely) I do believe abortion should be an option if her life is in danger. If adoption is possible and there is no financial or medical issues then I think she should take that route. 4.Not much to say here 5. You're right that number is closer to 50%-60% kids get adopted, but as I stated that doesn't mean there life will turn out bad. 6. No one is forcing them, put them up for adoption. Also it is not THEIR body, I thought I said that. Your body doesn't have different DNA and a different blood type. Also the mothers immune system might react to the different blood type, your immune system doesn't react against YOUR body, does it? 7. I've already countered this point Also I know someone will say,""Oh it's just a clump of cells, it's not alive"" According to NASA there is life on mars. You know what's on mars? A couple of bacteria and micro-organisms. If that's considered life, then why isn't a human fetus?

Therefore my definition of government (the political direction and control exercised over the actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities, societies, and states) better addresses the resolution. My opponent responds to my attack on his first contention by saying that by limiting the debate to the US the US law is at hand. There are two problems with this: 1) The debate should not be limited to the US (as explained above) 2) The resolution asks us if vigilantism is justified when the government fails to enforce the law. Essentially this means that no law is existing because a law not enforced is a law that is virtually nonexistent. So the US or international law becomes void. My opponent responds to my attack on his third contention by claiming that the death penalty would occur only when there was no doubt that the offender was guilty. However wrongful convictions can and will occur in the ""imperfect democracy"" that my opponent wants, so people can be convicted wrongly. He then addresses the founding fathers. I never claimed that the founding fathers were vigilantes; I said that the colonists were vigilantes. Furthermore he claims that ""vigilantes avenge unpunished crimes, not unchecked criminal regimes."" However the crime was committed BY the regime BECAUSE they did not enforce the law. So basically they avenge criminal regimes. My opponent then responds to my attack on his fifth contention by saying that we have the duty from protecting that person by subduing them and holding them. However what happens if the rapist (or murderer, etc.) has a weapon? Holding them down won't do much good: they would simply use said weapon. He then claims that my second contention is untopical through his definition of government. As discussed above my definition of government is better since it addresses the entire world as opposed to a single country. Thus you can drop his attack on my second contention. My opponent then attacks my value criterion, citing that it eventually comes down to who decides to what is justice. But, isn't that what happens present-day in the courts: the judge ultimately decides if the offender is guilty? And who votes these judges in? The people. So, essentially, the people shave the right to decide what is justice in either case, which is exactly what vigilantism is. He then supports his VC by claiming that we are protecting the rights of everyone. Really? Is that even happening now? Previously, my opponent claimed that these rights included cruel and unusual punishment. Isn't that happening now, in many cases throughout the world (Guantanamo, etc.)?

People took a claim, which was accepted by many, and considered it true, without strong evidence. They used false positive evidence to 'prove' the existence of God.

This is important to acknowledge WHY our system of science today is so meticulous to ensure there are no biases ; only facts.

""Is run by"" = ""Is owned by"" My opponent shapes this entire resolution around the premise that Freemasons run MTV. This is essentially Pro saying that MTV is owned and operated by Freemasons. In reality, MTV is owned and run by Viacom, which is an American global mass media company with interests primarily in cinema and cable television. [1] So who owns Viacom?

Furthermore, Pro doesn't even provide evidence for this claim, he merely shares an image showing the inside of a Masonic Lodge.

It's the same picture of the inside of a Masonic Lodge. Pro needs to show how similarities between the MTV Video Music Awards and the Masonic floor pattern are connected. Merely having the same pattern or design does not prove anything. If I live in a house with Mediterranean tiles as my floor pattern, does that mean I'm Mediterranean? Absolutely not. In closing, Pro has provided zero evidence for a link between MTV and Freemasons running it. He has merely relied on conspiracy-influenced images which don't even show a comparison or connection. Furthermore, I've not only provided a counter-argument showing who really runs MTV, but I've also provided rebuttals for each argument raised by Pro. I now return the floor to Pro, thank you.

This is not actually an exaggeration (1) because research shows that, on average, most women spend nearly one year trying to decide what to wear. If parents help children decide what to wear, then the parents will also be wasting their time, and uniforms will benefit both parents and children. ""...Clothes can often be used to define social statuses..."" You agree that North Face can make you seem richer than others, and it is sometimes true that people wear different clothes to school (2).

"" I already explained that while an event can be possible mathematically (in that it has a probability) it can also be unlikely enough to be removed as a possibility. If your chances of EVER hitting a dartboard were that low, there would be no point in even trying. You would never hit it, period. So Con's analogy does accomplish nothing. Occam's razor tells us that we should not add an assumption to our theory if it does not explain the evidence any bettter. As Isaac Newton said, "" We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."" (1) Now, that would mean we should not add a componant that would require something practically impossible to happen to our theory of history. Abiogenesis is not a sufficient explanation, as it is practically impossible. Records aside, if our view of history requires something impossible to happen, it is probably wrong. For example, if my theory required Columbus to completely miss both North and South America (not an easy feat) and then sail to China with only half the supplies he actually needed, it would probably be wrong. Why? Well, the chances of Columbus doing that are practically impossible, especially given his mutinous crew. Occam's razor tells us that the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions or the simplest explanation should be (in general) preferred. The Christian view that God created life requires fewer assumptions than the evolutionary view that life spontaneously generated, a view that was disproven centuries ago and would require something impossible to happen. Believing in a Creator requires fewer leaps of the imagination than believing nature beat the (impossibly high) odds. But evolutionists prefer abiogenesis simply because it avoids God. Probability is not meaningless in the past. It is quite meaningful when we try to recreate a portion of the past that we are ensure of. We can conclude, based on probability, that some things definitely never happened (like abiogenesis). And, as I pointed out, if our view of history requires something impossible to happen, it is probably wrong . The reason evolutionists believe in the abiogenesis hypothesis is because excluding God, it's their only hope of explaining our life-filled world. Unfortunately, abiogenesis is, practically, impossible, which means that abiogenesis should remain a hypothesis and a failed one at that. Going back to the particular raindrop . . . IF the odds for a particular raindrop to hit your nose were that high, then that particular raindrop would not hit your nose. That would be impossible. It would be similar to picking one grain of sand off the beach and then coming back a year later and picking that same grain. So, how come a raindrop can hit my nose? Well, it is my turn to destroy Pro's argument with a probability example. Suppose the odds of picking up a particular grain of sand are 1:30,000,000,000. It would seem impossible that I could pick a grain of sand, right? And yet, I am able to pick a particular grain of sand, despite the odds. Do you catch the fallacy here? If I reach down on the beach, the odds that I will pick A grain of sand are 1:1. The same with the raindrops. If you stand in the rain for 5 minutes, the odds that A raindrop will hit your nose are 1:1. If you were looking for a particular raindrop to hit you, and the odds were as high as Pro calculated (I personally do not think they are accurate) then THAT PARTICULAR raindrop would never hit you. Reason: it would be statistically impossible. Nice try, Pro, but you accomplish nothing. "" You falsely assume in your final example that scientists are uninformed about the topic under discussion and research.

PowerPoint is much better from a utilitarian point of view. There is much more in this program that requires more than your basic knowledge of the software. PowerPoint is quite easy to use, all you really do is put information and pictures on slides and hit F5 for a full-screen presentation, simple.

I am currently using Vista and the only pop-ups from my OS are ones that require my authorization when starting a few programs. I would like my opponent to cite these so called work interrupting pop-ups so I can effectively refute this point. Simply saying these pop-ups exist is not enough to make a point in a debate.

478,"Premise One Con states that objective moral values would exist even if it conscious creatures did not. This is true, as objective moral values are independent of human (or any conscious beings) opinion. Two and two would always equal four whether there is anyone to prove it. Con's statement, though true, is a red herring. We are not debating the existence of objective moral values if no conscious entities exist. We are debating the meaning and usefulness of objective moral values, or moraly at all, absent of any conscious entity. My justification of Premise One in R3 states ' If every conscious creature were to vanish, then morality would become meaningless. ' I never said that it wouldn't exist, just that it would lack any meaning. This claim is obvious, as nobody would argue that a nebulae is concerned with the euthyphro dillehma. The justification one can provide for why cutting down trees does not have to relate to human flourishing. Con states that the reasoning has nothing to do with human flourishing, but this in not relevant. In order for Premise One to be true, it must be reducable to the well-being of conscious creatures, not necessarily human flourishing. Con changed the terms of my argument. It does not matter if the person does not expressively state a reason that relates to well-being. My premise states that it has to be reducible to well-being. That is, we can reduce that moral claim to something relating to well-being. It does not mean that the person has to say something relating to well-being. If a person argued we should preserve the earth just for the sake of preserving the earth, then it is reducible to well-being, even if they do not say so. As I pointed out, preserving the earth relates to the well-being of conscious creatures. Thus, preserving the earth is reducible to well-being, and Premise One remains true. Con misunderstands me. I have not argued that we have to come to all conclusions about moral questions scientifically. I don't, for instance, think that I will consult a scientist on whether I should buy my daughter a tropical fish for her birthday. I am only arguing that the seperation between morality and science is not valid. Premise Two The fact/value distinction is not logical. Values are morals, and morals are just a type of fact about the way things should be. Con and I both believe in objective moral values, so we both believe that there are objective rights and wrongs. These right and wrong statements are just facts about what is right and wrong. From this, I believe that the distinction between facts and values is like trying to make a distinction between A and A, or blue and blue. Premise Three I should clarify the metaphor to make this debate easier, since the point I needed to make with it has already been made. Healthy food is a representation of the myriad of action and ideas that improve the well-being of conscious creatures. Poison is a representation of all the actions and ideas that can harm the well-being of conscious creatures. If improving (or maximizing) well-being is moral, then science can not only inform moral decisions, but tell us what is moral. I believe that is a logical result of ackwnowledging well-being as the basis of morality. We have many cases where science can do more than inform moral decisions, but make them. Of course, as I have said, I do not believe that science can decide every moral question. Otherwise, the resolution would state 'Science determines human values'. It does not state this. There are moral questions that we can only answer purely through philosophical, rather than scientific, reasoning. An admission of this fact does not negate the resolution. Possible Round 5 Suggestion I believe that R5 could be made far more interesting if we simply answer questions. I propose that in R4, we both ask each other three questions that will be answered in R5 of the debate. R5 will be devoted entirely to answering those questions. If Con does not wish to accept, then we will continue on with a five-round debate. If he wishes to accept, then I ask him to make his questions in R4. 1: You are recognized as a defender of Christianity on debate.org. In your view, what is the role of god in objective moral value? 2: Are there any methods of ethical naturalism that you would accept? 3: If you were to stop believing in god, would you become a moral relativist, or some form of moral nihilist?

But, how can he conclude that the education system of NSW is not too hard for those with an ""easier"" education system? Pro thinks that the education system of NSW isn't too hard.

  Thank you pro for taking part in this debate.  
  Quoting:  
  “  My resolution is as follows which i am changing or the last time  - Australia should have a national education system which would be equivalent to the current NSW education system  ”  
  With this, pro has admitted to changing the resolution for the topic of the debate (in the very last round!). He therefore implies that the resolution that I followed was correct the entire time and that HE was the one mistaken.   
  “  I have chosen The NSW education system because it is harder than all the other Australian education systems but not too hard as i would like the students to cope to a harder education in minimum possible time  ”  
  Pro is putting for a VERY BIASED   unsupported opinion  . He thinks that that any education system other than the NSW’s education system is too hard. But, how can he conclude that the education system of NSW is not too hard for those with an “easier” education system?   
  Pro thinks that the education system of NSW isn’t too hard. Why wouldn’t the education system of South Korea not be too hard for the Australian system? [1] I think it is possible for the students of Australia to imitate the students of South Korea. If the Korean students are able to cope, there is nothing to say that we Australian students can’t follow. The only barrier that stops us is the TIME TO ADAPT.   
  “  Profit  - As Australia has one education system then there would not be a point for one education system per state  - The people that lose their job will be trained to the new system and then will replace the old teachers  ”

  “  My case has boiled down to 3 main points  If the current education system stays  - Gifted and Talented Students from other states will suffer  - HSC students will suffer  - Students from all states except NSW students will suffer  ”  
  Response:   
  
  Pro’s claim about the GAT from other states suffering is a biased opinion with no logical reason. Pro doesn’t seem to grasp what GAT means. If someone is “Gifted”, as well as “Talented”, clearly they will easily cope with a new education system that is “harder” and will soon be GAT within that education system.

  “  My opponent has started his debate with a contradicting resolution which supports both sides. I have proven that in round 4 and Con has not rebutted against that claim meaning he agrees.  ”  
  I’m sorry Pro, but when I put forth my resolution as “  The Australian education should remain the   same”.   I was saying that the education should not be changed.  Thus, the same applies with “  The Australian education should remain the same and have a variety of styles with education  ”. Pro doesn’t seem to grasp my idea. The education should not be changed, meaning there will still be a variety of education within the nation. This means the education system should not be the same as NSW.   
  “  Con's Argument has boiled down to 2 main points  ”   
  My argument has boiled down to 2 main points? It is still following one resolution!   
     
  Conclusion:   
  The education within the whole of Australia should remain the same, meaning the education should not be changed.

482,"Thanks to my opponent. My opponent has cited a comment to an article as proof that the editor in chief resigned from the journal due to the fact that she was not critical of the manuscript been published, but that her career was put in jeopardy. Firstly, this is not true she is a highly regards chemist and a list of her achievements can be easily seen, she resigned because the manuscript should never have been published as I have pointed out in the first round.(1) Secondly my opponent asserts this comment as proof, yet the person who wrote the comment states that "" Rather, she said that she could not read and evaluate it, because, she claimed, it lies outside the areas of her expertise. "" This is a bold faced lie, as Professor Pileni is very well published in the nano material field, and like I said is a well respected chemist.(2, 3) This comment needs to be corroborated by a statement from Professor Pileni from a reputable source and not some comment attached to a news story. Comments are not news, they are personal opinions. I would ask that my opponent does not use dishonest sources to promote his claim when the evidence runs counter to this. My opponent criticizes me for, wondering about the chain of custody. Yet to not admit that non scientists were involved in the chain of custody is a dishonest statement. This means immediately that the chain of custody should be questioned as they were non scientists with no formal training in sample handling. However, let the chain of custody not detract from the dropped point that the authors made no attempt to verify the material came from the WTC using chemical signatures. Hence, my opponent drops the critical point that we cannot be certain that the samples come from the WTC. Next I would like to discuss the following new contentions. The presence of the Thermite in the WTC according to the authors is thought to be normal thermite composition. This means it has 2 part Aluminum to 1 part Iron Oxide, and importantly they have to be intimately mixed.(4,5) If these materials are not intimately mixed the do not work, so why then are there two layers in the sample? See the reaction below for the thermite reaction. Fe 2 O 3 + 2 Al - 2 Fe + Al 2 O 3 From this reaction, we can learn about the composition of the material, however in the EDX spectra in Figure 7 there are two points of contention. 1) Why are the aluminum and Iron peaks not the same intensity as they should be? and 2) Why does the spectrum look exactly like and EDX spectrum of iron oxide commonly found in nature.(6,7) From contention 2, we can say that this material could come from any natural source and does not have to be manufactured thermite. From contention 1, we can say that this is not thermite as the chemical composition is not accurate. So how are we sure that this is thermite when it could come from another source. The correct thing to do would have been to use a more reliable analysis like elemental analysis and not EDX. Why did the authors not do this? The data as currently shown is not proof of thermite as the compositions are not correct and could be any commonly found iron oxide. Lastly, why are Figure 14 and 7 different if they are from the same sample? The authors did not say they were removing signals for clarity, so this is a dubious result. This casts huge doubt on the validity of the manuscript, as all the spectra in figure 7 are the same, yet in figure 14 the spectra from the same samples has changed. Note the inaccuracies in C, O, S, Ca and Zn content.(8) Over to my opponent. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>... (3) <URL>... (4) <URL>... (5) <URL>... (6) <URL>... (7) <URL>...

He says that Cato accepted Big Tobacco donations "" and in turn jumping on the Big Tobacco bandwagon."" The earliest instance Pro cites of donations to Cato from ""Big Tobacco"" like donors was in 1991. However, Cato from its inception (in 1974, 17 years before the first donation in question) has been an opponent of government action to curb non-aggressive individual activities. Things like smoking bans and corporate regulation are something Cato has always been opposed to, which would naturally put them somewhat in line with the interest of tobacco corporations. Pro needs to establish that Cato's content was posterior to the various donations and has failed to do so thus far. 2) On Pro's examples, he fails to show that the content must be biased. For instance, Pro says Cato ""has challenged credible science that links second hand smoke exposure to death and disease and has organized opposition to smoke-free environments."" On the first claim, Pro doesn't offer any substantive evidence to back the claim up. On the second claim, opposing ""smoke-free environments"" is incredibly vague. Is he referring to private residences and properties or is he referring to public places? The former is basic private propertarian ideology, something Cato supported before the 90's. The latter also needs backing up by Pro since he also failed to provide evidence supporting it. 3) Pro's claim attempting to link the Cato Institute's opposition to the FDA is also misleading. Since the FDA's main function is to regulate the output of private industry and Cato from its inception has been a predominantly free market thing tank, it's natural that Cato would be opposed to it. Therefore Pro simply saying Cato has spent money writing against the FDA fails to prove anything. C2: Cato and Climate Change 1) First, Pro's only claim is that Cato holds to a certain position without actually even attempting to show why it should discredit Cato. Let's go out on a limb and say Cato (as a monolithic entity I suppose) wholesale denies climate change (not just certain aspects or the prospect of government intervention). Why should this wholly discredit the organization? Cato isn't just a scientific institution. It also deals with topics dealing with a large range of policy issues. Let's say Cato is wrong on climate change. That still doesn't fulfill the rather large burden of proof Pro has assumed in attempting to discredit the entire organization. 2) Pro has also been incredibly ambiguous on Cato's actual policy in regards to global climate change. He alludes several times to Cato's opposition to various State actions attempting to mitigate climate change but never actually mentions across the board beliefs of Cato scholars and writers.

506,"I thank stepphon66 for instigating this debate. First of all, I would like to remind my opponent that the BoP lies on Pro as he made the claim. I also remind my opponent that while this debate had been put in the religion category, it does not have a religious topic. Instead my opponent merely uses arguments pertaining to religion to support his claim, and only made the statement ""you will have to explain what evidence or premises christians and buddhists etc. have and how their beliefs can all be true"" after I accepted. Therefore I will not be limiting myself to religious grounds (nor ignoring it), and I urge my opponent to do the same. Credulous as defined by Dictionary.com is ""willing to believe or trust too readily, especially without proper or adequate evidence; gullible."" Note that while my opponent focuses on the terms 'without ... evidence; gullible' [1], the definition included the phrase 'too readily', which implies a repeating pattern. A similar phrase is present in multiple other trusted online dictionary sources [2]. Indeed, for a trait to be part of an individual (which the word 'are' in the topic backs up as the definition of the claim) and not merely present it has to be dominating. Therefore, to make the claim that ""Most people are credulous"", the claim that ""Most people are credulous most of the time"" has to be made first. The evidence and statistics my opponent provides, then, (and may I add are without source or evidence) are not enough to prove that statement, in the same sense that we don't call someone a liar if they had lied twice in their life. Now, my opponent seems to assume that all individuals who believe in a religion believes based on 'whatever their leaders recommend' and utilizes no evidence. The truth is vastly more complicated on several counts. I will now present several exceptions to my opponent's claim. Religion aren""t cults. There are no definite leader(s) for all believers of any certain religion. Many believers believe of their own accord, without relying on a leader to know what to believe. The simplest and most verifiable example being myself, as I am a christian yet believe based off my own choices rather than what my parents or any church leaders tell me. There is a distinction between 'credulous' and 'ignorant'. In this context, credulous is believing in something with little to none evidence, while ignorant is believing in something with lots of evidence, but all the wrong ones. An individual may believe in a religion with many fallacies, yet still not be credulous, as they believe that the evidence they""ve been provided is enough for a rational belief, even if they seem ridiculous to others. Pro fails to regard this possibility in his arguments. Pascal's Wager is an argument made by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century [4] on the rational choice of believing in God in order to not risk the possibility of losing infinite eternal gain or vice versa, should it happen to be true. In this case individuals who abide by this principle are not credulous, as they do not believe ""readily"", the decision came after extensive rational thought, they acknowledge the lack of evidences, and they are certainly not gullible. I will now provide a argument of my own. As I said earlier, for an individual to be classified as credulous the trait must be dominant. Yet our society functions on non-credulousness. From grocery shopping to crime courts, we require credibility. In a credulous society, criminals will be released based on their statements of innocence, and costumers will spend a fortune for an ordinary rock just because they are told so. Thus our society cannot have most of its individuals be credulous. I look forward to my opponent""s rebuttal and to learn from a fellow debater. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>...

His definition states that a person violates the law to ensure justice when they think that the criminal will not be be caught. However, it is not necessary for one to break the law to ensure justice: for example, if one steals food from a grocery store, and another stops him, then the second person is not breaking the law, but is still acting as a vigilante to ensure justice in the society. I disagree with my opponent's definition of government. He states that the government refers to the United States. However, because the US is not stated in the actual resolution, government cannot mean only the United States government. My value is the same as my opponent's, so I have no argument. My opponent's value criterion is protecting rights. He cites that vigilantism offers no protection of various governmental rights. What he fails to note is that when the government has failed to enforce the law, the government is null and void, because the government does not do its job of protecting its citizens. If the government is null then so are the rights it ""guarantees"". My opponent's first contention claims that the law itself might be unjust or even criminal under international law. He cites the Fugitive Slave Act and the Jim Crow laws. However, no international organization was existing when these laws were being implemented, so no international law existed. My opponent's second contention claims that vigilantism leads to anarchy. He cites that an imperfect democracy is the best form of government. However, a democracy is run by the people. Vigilantes are also people, so won't they have input in the democracy? So, under my opponent's contention, if vigilantes are really criminals, then criminals would be running the democracy. So if this occurred wouldn't the best form of government would be republicanism, where leaders are elected by popular vote. Criminals make up for a small minority of the population so their votes would not really be existent. My opponent's third contention claims that vigilantism is unjust. He admits that the law can go wrong, but only after being found guilty by a jury. However, remember that vigilantes would only act as a last resort because of a failure of the established law system. So only if the government wasn't willing to convict a murderer in which there was clear evidence of the crime would vigilantes act. My opponent's fourth contention claims that vigilantism interferes with constitutional rights. He cites the Sixth Amendment, stating that an impartial jury should be reviewing the case. Again, remember that vigilantes would only act as a last resort because of a failure of the established law system. Only if this system did not work would vigilantes take place. My opponent's fifth contention is an attack on my case, claiming that my examples are untopical. He states that we ""are only allowed to use as much force that's required to stop the attacker"". The question then becomes how much force is required. If one is intent on raping someone, for example, then I am sure that telling the rapist ""Don't do that, that's against the law"" won't do much. Rather, what one must do is not chainsaw the attacker, but ensure justice occurs in a meaningful way. My opponent's sixth contention claims that the government may be strapped for resources. However, I don't exactly understand where my opponent is heading with this. Doesn't this support my side: the government is unable to enforce the law because of lack of money, and so it is upon the citizens to ensure justice in the society. If my opponent could elaborate on this contention that would be helpful. My opponent's conclusion is cut off, so I don't have any comment. I await my opponent's response.

Re-Rebuttal: Graffiti definition My definition for graffiti came from Merriam-Webster and, since my opponent used this same dictionary to define vandalism, I would believe my opponent's arguments against my definition being ""false"" are unjust. Since my opponent didn't provide a source for his/her definition I feel that it should be disregarded and not only should my definition be set as the definition for this debate, but all my opponent's arguments used with the other definition should be considered opinion and disregarded. Rebuttal 1: ""The obvious answer as always. And as always, completly false. Graffiti is also a form of art, drawing letters into a specific shape in order to make it more appealing. Because of such, if someone were to draw graffiti on a piece of paper, not only is it art, but legal."" I have no idea what my opponent is saying in the first two sentences. However, for the rest of the statement, according to the definition of graffiti, it must be on a public surface to be considered graffiti. a piece of paper is not a public surface and therefore a drawing on a piece of paper is not, by definition, graffiti. Rebuttal 2: ""Art is vague"" This first paragraph has no basis behind it and should be considered solely an attempt by my opponent to increase the broadness of this debate more in his/her favor. Since there is a definition, this debate should follow by this definition. My opponent does not have the right to change the resolution of the debate by trying to claim that art can't be defined. If my opponent wanted to use his/her personal made up definitions then they should have been stated in his/her opening statement. According to the definition of art, ""the quality, production, expression, or realm, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance."" The significance of graffiti comes from the cost to the tax payers. San Francisco spends $20 million dollars a year on graffiti removal.(1) This causes the city to have to tax its innocent residents for crimes they haven't committed and to remove drawings and writings that they don't want. It also lowers housing values in the neighborhoods. Therefore any significance from the drawing has to be greater than the significance of it simply being vandalism needing to be removed. That picture provided is nice. However, my opponent has not proven that this picture is ""graffiti"". I went to the site provided and it doesn't mention it being unauthorized. This could be an authorized mural. The following website is a building in the Mission District of San Francisco that is a mural, not graffiti. These types of works can be found all over the bay area and are considered art. <URL>... However, Costing innocent residents $20 million dollars a year, plus the loss of value of their property, is not appealing, beautiful, productive, or any of the other parts of the definition of art. That $20 million a year, is just the city of San Francisco. That doesn't count the costs in Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, or any other cities just in the bay area or throughout the country. Rebuttal 3: ""Graffiti is different from vandalism."" ""Whereas vandalism would be: ""willful or malicious destruction or defacement of public or private property"" [2]"" I accept this definition for vandalism because it was reliably sourced. This definition of vandalism is almost the exact same as graffiti. Because graffiti is unauthorized drawings, it is therefore malicious destruction of public property. Therefore, my opponent's contention is false because according to the definitions, graffiti is always vandalism even though vandalism might not always be graffiti. ""Though graffit can be used as vandalism, it isn't always. It is used to make posters, to draw for art class, to have fun with. Because of such, it can be art. Therefore I have already upheld my side of the resolution ""graffiti can be art""."" Once again, since this does not fit the definition of graffiti, this should be disregarded. Drawing on a poster for an art class is not an unauthorized drawing on public property. Conclusion: It is unreasonable for me to explain every piece of graffiti ever made. Since it is more reasonable for my opponent to simply show one piece of graffiti that could be art to disprove me, the burden of proof falls on my opponent. Because my opponent did not provide a single example of a piece of art that actually fit the definition of graffiti, my opponent has failed to prove that ""graffiti can be art"". I have proven that graffiti cannot be art, but is rather a selfish act of vandalism that will only have negative results on the community. It forces the community to clean up after others rather than spending the money on community centers, or other services that could improve the lives of its residents. I personally offer a math and science tutoring service for low income students here in Oakland and all expenses come from my pocket because the city is too busy cleaning up after these vandals. However, if they weren't spending that money, I could possibly do group sessions at the local community center and not have to pay for it all myself. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>...",1,philly1,"

These types of works can be found all over the bay area and are considered art.  
  
  http://foundsf.org...  
  
However, Costing innocent residents $20 million dollars a year, plus the loss of value of their property, is not appealing, beautiful, productive, or any of the other parts of the definition of art. That $20 million a year, is just the city of San Francisco. That doesn't count the costs in Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, or any other cities just in the bay area or throughout the country.  
  
Rebuttal 3: ""Graffiti is different from vandalism.""  
""Whereas vandalism would be:  
""willful or malicious destruction or defacement of public or private property"" [2]""  
  
I accept this definition for vandalism because it was reliably sourced. This definition of vandalism is almost the exact same as graffiti. Because graffiti is unauthorized drawings, it is therefore malicious destruction of public property. Therefore, my opponent's contention is false because according to the definitions, graffiti is always vandalism even though vandalism might not always be graffiti.  
  
""Though graffit can be used as vandalism, it isn't always. It is used to make posters, to draw for art class, to have fun with. Because of such, it can be art. Therefore I have already upheld my side of the resolution ""graffiti can be art"".""  
  
Once again, since this does not fit the definition of graffiti, this should be disregarded. Drawing on a poster for an art class is not an unauthorized drawing on public property.  
  
Conclusion:  
It is unreasonable for me to explain every piece of graffiti ever made. Since it is more reasonable for my opponent to simply show one piece of graffiti that could be art to disprove me, the burden of proof falls on my opponent. Because my opponent did not provide a single example of a piece of art that actually fit the definition of graffiti, my opponent has failed to prove that ""graffiti can be art"".  
  
I have proven that graffiti cannot be art, but is rather a selfish act of vandalism that will only have negative results on the community. It forces the community to clean up after others rather than spending the money on community centers, or other services that could improve the lives of its residents.  
  
I personally offer a math and science tutoring service for low income students here in Oakland and all expenses come from my pocket because the city is too busy cleaning up after these vandals. However, if they weren't spending that money, I could possibly do group sessions at the local community center and not have to pay for it all myself.

Human Rights: Another Term for Desires Right is an elusive term. Human right, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is ""a right that is believed to belong justifiably to every person."" [2] But what would constitute ""a right that is believed to belong justifiably to every person?"" Would right to self-defense be a part of rights belong to any human being? Perhaps and perhaps not. In nature, strong preys on the weak and there is so such thing called right to kill or right not to be killed. Self-defense is a mean to survive, a instinct imprinted in all species, including humans. Human civilizations are the product of nature. Therefore, in essence, humans are no different from other species: we are all fighting for our own survival. If human rights are indeed inalienable rights conferred by the Supreme Being, why did the salves (Spartacus for example) who live in ancient Rome Empire have to resort to violence to have the right to liberty? Why did God abandon him and his followers who are ruthlessly crucified by Roman legions? Would emancipation still be possible if President Lincoln was defeated in the American Civil War? Then what are Human rights if they are not conferred by nature? The answer is: Human rights are what we desire. The nexus between desire and rights is very complicate. Naturally we want to believe we have a right to that which we desire. Equality and liberty, for examples, are virtually non-existed until the founding of America. Since people are not born equally and we all long for equability, we cover our desires into something indestructible: inalienable rights. Years ago, during an interview, Mr.Warren Buffett said: ""Before you enter the word, you will pick one ball from a barrel of 6.8 billion. That ball will determine your gender, race, nationality, natural ability, and health - whether you are born rich or poor, sick or able-bodied, brilliant or below average, American or Zimbabwean."" [3] As he explained to a group of University of Florida students, ""You""re going to get one ball out of there, and that is the most important thing that is ever going to happen to you in your life."" in conclusion, equality and liberty are not something we are entitled to, but what we desire. 3. Secular Government Can Be the Protector of Human Rights Undeniably, not all governments are American alike. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, for example, murdered hundreds of innocents people to maintain his ruling. President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, for instance, issued an decree to shield him from judicial review to consolidate his power. But if democratic government is the evolutionary end of all governmental systems, Human Rights, in theory, could be adequately guarded by it. The main object of any ruling party in a democratic government is to secure the further of its governing by maintaing a peaceful living environmental and promoting general welfare for its people. Special interests are somewhat unavoidable given the fact that money is the symbol of power. But as long as such special interests do not fundamentally alter the nature of democracy, we should expect the government to continue respecting human rights for the purpose of prolonging its legitimacy. 4. Religion is Not the Answer Apparently, not all type of governments are able to adequately protect human rights, many perhaps are unwilling to protect given the fact that fear and oppression are much more powerful and effective tools to govern people. But religions are not the answer. Religion, since its inception, is largely utilized as a political tool to advance some special interests. The war between Christians and Muslims epitomizes the power of religion, and how religion can lead to violence and blood. Today, Hamas, in the name of God, dedicates its charter to Israeli destruction because their god despises Jews. Russian authority, in the name of God, arrests Pussycat, a popular pop music group for its criticism of Primer Mister Vladimir Putin. For some rulers, the word God is often used as a semantic stop-sign, meaning simultaneously ""Stop asking questions."" It is hard to believe religion, in the hands of wrong people, would sufficiently protect human rights. 5. Conclusion Human rights are rights desired by human beings. But what we desire is not necessary what we are entitled to. Although not all governments are willing to protect their own people from human rights abuse, religions may perhaps do more harm than good in these cases. Democratic government, in hope of prolonging its governing, may resort to promote human rights to avoid social upheavals, which would inexorably undermine the strengthen of its ruling.

While I do not find this completely fair, he has not broken any written rules. I am Con Marijuana, Pro medical Marijuana. Therefore I will be playing somewhat of the devils advocate. Just because something feels good to people who are sick, is not a reason to legalize it. Marijuana is proven to be a dangerous drug. Some of the short term effects are: 1. Distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch). 2. Problems with memory and learning. 3. Loss of coordination. 4. Trouble with thinking and problem-solving. 5. Increased heart rate, reduced blood pressure. There are many reasons why these things can be bad, I will go through them one by one as quickly as I can. 1. Distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch). This is very dangerous, the reason is because people will take the drug and drive at the same time. Car accidents will go through the roof. This is an example of death with Marijuana. What people like to do is say that no one has died because of Marijuana. Well, no one has died of a cell phone, yet many people die from talking while driving. 2. Problems with memory and learning. Children these days already are failing in school. Why would we want to add to that? They need all the memory and learning they can get. 3. Loss of coordination. This corresponds with number one. More accidents, more deaths. 4. Trouble with thinking and problem-solving. This also corresponds with number two. But not only for kids, people need all the brain power they can get. 5. Increased heart rate, reduced blood pressure. Some people do not even know that they have a bad heart. Marijuana could hurt these people. It would be no use to use on most sick patients. Lots of them have a bad heart. Many people who take the drug for medical purposes get addicted to it. Many people do not get addicted to it, but there are some that do. There are also many other dangerous effects. Like sleepiness, an altered sense of time and space, hallucinations, delusions, disorientation. Marijuana contains more than 400 different chemicals; this is bad for obvious reasons. Marijuana also can lead to lung and/or throat cancer. (Again, they don't die of Marijuana, just cancer.) Your father's theory sounds good, but there can not be a law based off of it. Just because 8 out of 10 people say that there is a KFC on the moon does not make it true. Something else to consider, there would be a major increase in health problems. Therefore, there would be a major increase in the cost of health care. No one in any country wants this. I will stop here for now and look forward to your response. May the force, again.

1. Distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch).  
This is very dangerous, the reason is because people will take the drug and drive at the same time. Car accidents will go through the roof. This is an example of death with Marijuana. What people like to do is say that no one has died because of Marijuana. Well, no one has died of a cell phone, yet many people die from talking while driving.  
  
2. Problems with memory and learning.  
Children these days already are failing in school. Why would we want to add to that? They need all the memory and learning they can get.  
  
3. Loss of coordination.  
This corresponds with number one. More accidents, more deaths.  
  
4. Trouble with thinking and problem-solving.  
This also corresponds with number two. But not only for kids, people need all the brain power they can get.  
  
5. Increased heart rate, reduced blood pressure.  
Some people do not even know that they have a bad heart. Marijuana could hurt these people. It would be no use to use on most sick patients. Lots of them have a bad heart.  
  
Many people who take the drug for medical purposes get addicted to it.  
Many people do not get addicted to it, but there are some that do.  
There are also many other dangerous effects.  
Like sleepiness, an altered sense of time and space, hallucinations, delusions, disorientation.  
Marijuana contains more than 400 different chemicals; this is bad for obvious reasons.  
Marijuana also can lead to lung and/or throat cancer. (Again, they don't die of Marijuana, just cancer.)  
  
Your father's theory sounds good, but there can not be a law based off of it.  
Just because 8 out of 10 people say that there is a KFC on the moon does not make it true.  
  
Something else to consider, there would be a major increase in health problems.  
Therefore, there would be a major increase in the cost of health care.  
No one in any country wants this.  
  
I will stop here for now and look forward to your response.  
  
May the force, again.  
  
AND I AM YOUR FATHER!!!!

I will be arguing that most High Schools that have foreign language programs offer a sufficient number of foreign languages. Rebuttals: Pro writes ""Students must have the opportunity to learn another language because that increased knowledge will help students prosper in the career the choose."" Not necessarily. If I get a job as a farmer in the midwest, I'm unlikely to realize a tremendous benefit from speaking Estonian. Pro writes ""Learning about more languages and cultures will enable students to connect with the entire world."" Possibly. Of course, if I spend all my time studying Yazoo [1], I'm unlikely to be better able to connect with the entire world than someone who only speaks English. Pro writes ""Professionals who know other languages are called upon for amazing opportunities that require that person to communicate with other countries."" Again, depends on the language. Sure, I might be made a great offer that's only valid if I speak Reformed Egyptian, but the odds of that are long. Pro writes ""Bilinguals have a larger advantage over those people who only know one language."" Even though this is not sourced, it is probably true. However, Pro has failed to show that more obscure languages are preferable to the mainstream ones generally offered by schools. Pro writes ""More languages need to be offered so all students will have the chance to increase their knowledge."" Pro completely fails to justify how more languages will help all students to have a chance to increase their knowledge. I have never known a student (anecdotal evidence, sue me) that was fluent in every single language offered by the school. That means that every student I knew (anecdotal evidence, oh the pain) could have still gained knowledge through the language programs already offered by their school. Arguments: 1. Cost Self-explanatory. There's no way you can advocate for adding additional language classes, and then claim that these additions will be free. More language classes will cost more money, the school will probably need to hire teachers who know how to teach the language, and it'll be a hassle. 2. Inconveniences There are probably already language programs offered at most every school. They'll be languages like Spanish, French, Chinese, Arabic, nothing too fancy. A school only needs a few language programs for students to choose a language from; adding additional languages causes a ""slippery slope"" issue. If my cousin successfully advocates for getting himself a Kusunda class [2], what grounds does the school have for refusing me a Kwadi class? 3. Kids are stupid Fairly self-explanatory. If you stick kids with three or four language options and say ""Pick one"", they'll pick one. If you say ""Hey, we're expanding the language classes, sign up for whatever language you want"", you'll have a ton of morons signing up for languages they never even knew existed and would have remained contently ignorant of. Plus, you'll probably get a bunch of languages only a couple of people want to study. Tie this in with my argument above, and you can see why this would be a problem. 4. Bilinguality Most schools offer decently usable, fairly common, modern languages like Spanish and Chinese. If I learn one of those languages, I'm about as equipped as can be. It's certainly of more use than that dunce who spent his whole high school career learning Latin [3]. If I'm going to receive an opportunity that requires me to speak some obscure language, the odds are definitely against me knowing it.

Which means that in some cases, zoos are actually helping species regain their ability to carry on breeding and making bigger their race. A common argument to this is that animals can breed freely in the wild without becoming extinct. This is wrong because under the current influence of man this actually is not possible for some species, eg elephants, could become extinct as they are wanted for many things, skins, tusks and so on. Another example would be tuatara,s if it weren't for zoos and recreational parks we wouldn't ever be able to see them. Secondly i would like to bring up the matter of the public. when are the general public ever going to be able to see animals like giraffes and zebras,anywhere other than zoos?

I think it would be a tremendous success if third world stopped existing for society as a whole. Society in fact should concentrate on trying to improve the third world countries. The result might be that the wealthy people would not be so wealthy, but what about the starving people in these countries?  
  
I will now let my opponent post his argument for round three.

First, I want to note that evaluating whether a particular historical figure is the ""best leader"" of all time is inherently tricky and vague, given that 1. we don't have a clear definition of what constitutes a great leader and 2. even if we did, we don't have a specific way of measuring how much of a leader someone is. However, what we can do is approximate. To be frank, I'm uninterested in arguing with my opponent about how Hitler rose to power. Let's assume for the sake of argument that Hitler did astounding things to achieve his position and control over Germany so quickly and effectively - and indeed, I will agree with this assessment. He was particularly adept at deceiving the common people, eliminating any political enemies, and blaming any problems Germany had at the time on someone/something else except himself. That, along with some other factors and his strong willed political goals was a perfect timing for the morale low Germany was going through. However, what my point of contention focuses on is Hitler's conduct during the latter half of WW2. This is particularly relevant as a global war is as a good test for a leader as can be, especially when Hitler positioned himself to be the supreme commander of Germany's military. He had the erroneous central belief that strong will can guarantee victories - this was shown to be blatantly false given the outcome of WW2. Further, he was much too stubborn and suspicious of his subordinates, and a great leader that isolates his people can't be counted as such. Simply put, the characteristics that made him a great leader (strong will) also led to his downfall, as his terrible personality led to horrid military mistakes. Being one of the best leaders of all time does not entail making yourself the supreme commander of your nation's military, and then going on to aid it's downfall.",1,TheSkeptic,"

And to say that illegal immigration only affects the border states is just show how ill-informed you are. It affects the whole nation negatively and to say otherwise is just ignorance. We lose several billions a year to them, yet liberals praise them at every turn. Crank out spanish news papers, form all spanish speaking communities, slowly but surely make Americans conform to a bunch of criminals here illegally, and call any who oppose them racist!

He is immoral, a criminal, a draft dodger, and a liar. I guess he is a great liberal candidate. By the by, giving tax cuts to the rich is probably the best thing you can do for the economy. I don't know many people making 20,000 a year that are employers. Tax cuts for the rich result in lower prices, higher wages, and more jobs. Reaganomics. Clinton was a par president and a sub-par person at best. Why do you think white males are joining all-white gangs in record numbers? It isn't because of their hate for other races. It is because of racial discrimination towards them. They feel that equal rights aren't equal. They feel they are looked down on because of who they are. A white male is 85% more likely to be convicted of a hate crime than a minority. Yet a white male is more 70% more likely to be attacked by a minority than by a white person. Ok, let me close with this. I think I have given many points that give credit to my stance on this issue. The white males in America are considered racist, immoral, and money grubbing. It is assumed that if your white, you are rich and privileged. This is judging a person by the color of their skin, which is discrimination. Taking the white man's identity and portraying it to be evil unless they agree with you is discrimination. I refuse to live in fear of being called racist just because I don't agree with liberal ideals. I oppose illegal immigration, hate crimes, and affirmative action. If you think those are beliefs of a racist person, than I state that they are beliefs of a person who wants EQUAL rights for all Americans with no exceptions.",1,ericjpomeroy,"

Yet a white male is more 70% more likely to be attacked by a minority than by a white person.  
  
Ok, let me close with this. I think I have given many points that give credit to my stance on this issue. The white males in America are considered racist, immoral, and money grubbing. It is assumed that if your white, you are rich and privileged. This is judging a person by the color of their skin, which is discrimination. Taking the white man's identity and portraying it to be evil unless they agree with you is discrimination. I refuse to live in fear of being called racist just because I don't agree with liberal ideals. I oppose illegal immigration, hate crimes, and affirmative action. If you think those are beliefs of a racist person, than I state that they are beliefs of a person who wants EQUAL rights for all Americans with no exceptions.",Politics,3,The-straight-white-male-is-the-most-discriminated-person-in-America./1/,65695

Laws of Mathematics - basic principles upon which mathematics is founded (my own definition, I hope it is rigorous) Basically, I will prove that the laws of mathematics have been changed (ergo, are changeable) and can still be changed (again).

Here we have one example of a change in mathematical laws (the resolution now goes Con). Nevertheless, I will continue. When Newton and Leibnitz developed calculus, the need for infinity became apparent. They dropped the issue, believing it to be impossible, but the laws of calculus depend on infinity.

Thanks to Cantor's work, we have defined several aspects of infinity. Infinite sets can have parts removed from them without getting any smaller. Another important result of his work is the proof that infinities can be larger than each other. They are denoted by the Hebrew letter Aleph, with Aleph-null being the smallest infinity, Aleph-one being larger, Aleph-two larger etc. Here we see a drastic change in the laws of mathematics. Previously, the concept of infinity was completely undefined and thought to be nonexistent. With the advent of Georg Cantor, the Laws of Mathematics had to be modified to fit these new findings. My opponent's argument: ""My argument is that as long as the symbols and functions of math do not have their meanings changes, the laws of mathematics are unchangeable, no matter what you try to prove."" -What mongeese is saying is that as long as symbols and functions are not redefined, the laws of math do not change.

When it was proved that there are more real numbers than rationals, the laws of mathematics changed to accompany this. When infinities were accepted as existent, math modified. And a final note.

""Spongebob can easily call upon his best friend, Patrick Star, Who can eat Pretty much anything as seen by quite a few of the episodes. If that doesn't work he can just sit on the robot until it of course explodes, breaks, runs out of battery, etc."" 2. ""Spongebob can do what many classic TV shows have been doing all around the world. He could just hold up a famous Krabby Patty and make every citizen in Bikini Bottom to run over Plankton while they may be fighting."" These two arguments break the rules stated in Round 1 of the debate. In round 1, I state that: ""In a one-on-one battle to a fight that ends when one of the battlers become unconscious..."" Note the ""one-on-one battle"". However, in my opponents two arguments above, he mentions Spongebob summoning Patrick Star or the Bikini Bottom citizens, and that breaks the rules. Therefore, these two arguments are void and invalid. However, since it is likely that my opponent will try to prove that Plankton's inventions break the rules, I will demonstrate how they do not break the rules.

Plankton's inventions are not organisms, but tools, and therefore this battle is still one-on-one due to his inventions.

Since my opponent forfeited the last round, I have no arguments to rebut this round. However, I would like to post new rebuttals to my opponent's previous arguments.  
  
1. ""Spongebob can easily call upon his best friend, Patrick Star, Who can eat Pretty much anything as seen by quite a few of the episodes. If that doesn't work he can just sit on the robot until it of course explodes, breaks, runs out of battery, etc.""  
  
2. ""Spongebob can do what many classic TV shows have been doing all around the world. He could just hold up a famous Krabby Patty and make every citizen in Bikini Bottom to run over Plankton while they may be fighting.""  
  
These two arguments break the rules stated in Round 1 of the debate. In round 1, I state that:  
""In a one-on-one battle to a fight that ends when one of the battlers become unconscious...""  
  
Note the ""one-on-one battle"". However, in my opponents two arguments above, he mentions Spongebob summoning Patrick Star or the Bikini Bottom citizens, and that breaks the rules. Therefore, these two arguments are void and invalid. However, since it is likely that my opponent will try to prove that Plankton's inventions break the rules, I will demonstrate how they do not break the rules.

555,"Moon: The Moon on Earth serves many purposes, it is easily seen to affect the tides, but it is almost undisputed that the biggest role the Moon has on Earth is maintaining the Earths tilt. <URL>... Now what is the tilt of Venus and Mars in respect to Earth? Earth = 23.5 degrees Mars = 25 degrees Venus = 177 degrees <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Venus has a hell of a tilt, but what exactly does 177 degrees equal? If a planet has a tilt of 180 degrees, then it is upside down, so Venus actually has an axis of tilt of about 3 degrees, is UPSIDE DOWN, and spins the wrong way. Mars on the other hand is already similar to Earth tilt wise meaning that the seasons between Earth and Mars would be very similar compared to that of Venus and Earth. However the tilt tells another story, tilt of planets is vital because tilt determines the seasons of a planet, meaning that planets with no tilt or an extreme tilt (like Venus) would not have seasons, just day and night where the area around the equator would be bombarded with heat while the poles would receive much less heat. So if you take into account the tilt of Venus, along with the very close proximity of Venus to the sun, average temperatures of Venus ranges around 410 degrees Celsius, and that is not going to change. Earth's average temperature is about 14 degrees Celsius, Mars's average temperature is about -90 degrees <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Now if Mars and Venus would have to be similar to Earth, than these planets would need moons proportional to themselves like that of Earth to the moon. Venus is almost the size of Earth, meaning that if a massive moon would have to be found and brought very close to Venus for such a thing to work. Mercury is the only thing close by for Venus, but Mars on the other hand is about half the size of the Earth, meaning that a moon for Mars would be much smaller than Mercury, and with an asteroid belt nearby it could be feasible that overtime asteroids could be moved towards Mars, caught, then clustered to form a moon. Something that would be much easier overtime then nuking Mercury towards Venus and hoping that Mercury isnt destroyed in the process. <URL>... So to summarize my arguments up to this point, Mars is much similar to Earth temperature wise, seasonal wise, tilt wise, and could be altered moon wise much easier than Venus. Carbon argument Mars has more than enough CO2 to support plant life similar to Earth, and the amount of CO2 in Mars's atmosphere is similar to that of Earths Mars = 25% Earth = .039% Venus = 96.5% <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... So if we are to terraform both planets to have similar atmospheres to Earth, Mars is a much easier task than Venus is percentage wise. What about Nitrogen? Same links as above Venus = 3.5% Mars = 2.7% Earth = 78% So both Venus and Mars are very different from Earth Nitrogen wise, BUT consider this.... Mars is a lot smaller than Venus, so boosting the Nitrogen levels on Mars would be much quicker than boosting it on Venus because Mars's atmosphere is smaller but already more stable than that of Venus's SO2 aka Sulfer dioxide Venus = 150 ppm (parts per million) Earth = <.01 ppm Mars = unknown There arent many sources showing what % of Mars's atmosphere is S02, but since its not listed it is very very small. Basically, the amount of SO2 in Earth's atmosphere is similar to that of Mars's, and the atmosphere of Venus is saturated with SO2 in comparison to Earth and Mars. ============================================================================ ============================================================================ There are several other factors needed to be considered when wondering what must be done and what is needed to support human life on other planets similar to that of Earths. So far we have focused on changing the atmosphere fo the planets, examining temperature likeness to that of Earth, and examining seasonal changes, and a moon. Mars triumphs Venus in all of these categories since Mars is much smaller and can be manipulated more easily then Venus and is already similar to Earth already. Now for the other factors that must be considered, Water Exploitable resources Habitable at all? Water Mars has been found to at one point have had running water on its surface, and the planet right now has a large amount of water locked within the polar ice cap of the planet located at the North Pole. <URL>... Venus on the other hand at 400 degrees Celsius has absolutely NO water either frozen on land or anywhere in its atmosphere, meaning that Early colonization of the planets by a population of humans could be supported water wise on Mars today, whereas such a colonization of Venus water wise is impossible and will remain so for a very long time. Exploitable Resources Resources on Venus are almost entirely focused on the chemicals of the atmosphere of Venus, Carbon, Oxygen, Lead, that kind of stuff, nothing of very high value though. Mars on the other hand actually has a handful of metallic ores that could be used for trade or building civilization, such as Tin, Iron, Copper, Silver, and a few others. This means that when looking to colonizing Mars or Venus, Mars offers resources that can both be used to fund such transformations or carry out the transformations themselves....

(12)A high altitude baloon recorded a sunspot in some cloud cover about the size of the sun, directly under the sun, the sun was roughly overhead, but it appears that it was at about a 90° angle from the camera at it's apex. It was shot using a fisheye lens, and a regular lens. Which doesn't show any curvature..  Even close to the red bull dive cameras same height. which shows abnormal amounts of curvature, with the earth even curving outward at some points in the video.

This help is given to these old parents by old age homes. Today most of the old age homes are run by missionaries and also by many religions. Thus it is sure that these provide more love and care to these old people that is important for them. Today most children are greedy. So they take away all the wealth of their parents. This makes the parents homeless or penniless. Now can they hire helpers. NO.. So here the old age homes seem to be important. What would these people do if there were no old age homes?

577,"I'm not altogether sure if we're not veering off topic slightly from the purpose of debate? I don't think it would make sense to repeat my arguments against biophotons being a vector for any kind of data. Let me re-establish my explanation so as to make things clearer. What you defined in your previous argument was, as far as I understand it, that either biophotons or the human body's magnetic field, in combination with the earth's magnetic field, might provide a means of the receipt of and transmission of information. To be aware of and influence another, information - data - needs to pass to and from the person in question. For this, we need a sensor to receive, a transmitter to send with, and a medium for the information to pass through. For example, if I speak to someone, my receiver is my ears, my transmitter is my mouth, and the medium is the air through which pressure waves oscillate. Through sight I have eyes to receive with, a material surface to transmit radiant photons from (through reflection of incident light) and the medium is the electromagnetic field through which photons 'oscillate'. More specifically, a mode of information transmission must have a means of changing the medium, creating a variance in the medium to conduct information. For a human being to be aware of something, not only is all the above required but also another receiver/transmitter set up - the nervous system. If someone blocks off your nervous system you will not be conscious of any information, which is why we have, for example, local anaethetics (although they usually allow information about pressure to be relayed to the brain - just not pain). There are of course other mediums for information, for example hormone response. However, without a medium, a receiver and a transmitter, followed by another transmission by some means to the brain, there is no knowledge. With biophotons, already have an organ capable of receiving (at least some of) them - the eye. It has been postulated that the human cells could serve as a receiver, in particular brain cells, which contain photoreceptor proteins. It has been postulated that biophotons are emitted at a specific period and coherency, rather than as randomly scattered light. In the case of ordinary cells, some mechanism is assumed whereby the receipt of biophotons would affect the way the DNA molecule worked, alter cellular metabolism, then send a hormonal message to the brain. If it was brain cells doing the job, the information would already be in the brain. In practice, that biophotons are in phase rather than random is disputed by most scientists. The question is whether the photons are sent in neat coherent bundles, or are just flung out haphazardly. Coherency points to information transmission, whereas randomisation points to the latter. Firstly, the number of biophotons emitted is tiny. Really, really tiny. Second of all - have you ever heard the statement 'most of the atom is just space'? The odds of a biophoton travelling through the body and striking a receiving DNA structure or photoreceptive protein in a brain cell are not high. Especially not when you consider that the body is generally bathed in photons anyway from many sources. That would be a lot of background 'noise' to the information system. It also doesn't seem like a likely evolutionary development. Alongside that argument, few scientists agree that biophotons are coherent and most believe that it's just due to occasional jumps in atomic energy state. Completely random. Now for magnetic fields. The application of a magnetic field across cellular tissue does have an effect on human cells (for example, <URL>... ) but nothing conclusive has ever been shown about the earth's magnetic fields. It is occasionally postulated that there might be some subtle unaccounted for effect. Whilst this has not been proven not to be the case either, I think it likely that if magnetic fields influenced our minds and moods, we would get tearful or elated when walking under electricity pylons. I can't state anything with any clarity with regards to your paranormal experiences. I've had paranormal experiences myself - deja vu and a sense of shifting probability - but without rigorous scientific testing any such experiences are subjective and do not constitute truth. I've also had half-awake hallucinations, misheard people and mistaken trees for scary people looming out of the dark. (I am confused by the mention of a black hole. Are we speaking of a hole which is dark enough to appear black, or the gravitational well? I assume you mean the former!) You describe a sensation through skin, a 'touch' sense. If you could perceive electromagnetic radiation, you would be able to wear a blindfold at all times. You would also be strongly aware of your computer screen, your electric cables and plugs and so on. I think that this is highly unlikely and it is for this reason that I think it is more likely that you are either imagining it or perhaps perceiving the heat coming off the skin.

580,"At this point, nothing further will be gained by repeating the same arguments. I argue that Yoda's experience, skill, and knowledge make him the odds-on favorite to win; he argues that Luke learned quickly without having a teacher, and that he has awesome skillz. I compared the two using their duels with Palpatine as a benchmark: Yoda duels him to a stalemate just a few years before Yoda DIES OF EXTREME OLD AGE; Luke loses to him twice (while Palpatine is old and tired, and the second time old, DEAD and tired) and only wins the last time because his sister was there to assist. I point out that all the Force abilities Luke is learning are things known to the Jedi before the purge; undoubtedly Yoda knows them, since he spent over 700 years teaching them to the new Jedi. My opponent refuses to concede this, as is his right; but the truth is Luke has nothing on Yoda. My opponent claims Luke is stronger in the Force than Yoda; I have already refuted this - you need look no father than the official Wiki, where Yoda is listed as one of the three greatest Jedi to ever live, and one of the most powerful Force users ever. <URL>... First two sentences: ""Yoda was one of the most renowned and powerful Jedi Masters in galactic history. He was known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force and skills in lightsaber combat."" Third paragraph: ""...arguably the Order's greatest master of the Force and most skilled warrior..."" Powers and Abilities, first two sentences: ""Considered the greatest Jedi Master of the era by many, Yoda was one of the most skilled users of the Force in the history of the galaxy. Indeed the Grand Master was so strong in the Force that he demonstrated the ability to effortlessly disarm the powerful Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress, who was known to have defeated Jedi Council Masters, with a simple gesture."" That is the debate in a nutshell. I make no new arguments this round. My opponent's points are only relevant if one disregards everything I wrote. Sure, Luke learns Shatterpoint. Sure, luke does, eventually, finally, defeat the old dead Emperor. Sure, Luke has a high midichlorian count. None of that matters if he cannot match up to Yoda in skill, attunement to the Force, or experience in dueling. I think that I have shown he cannot. I return this debate to my opponent for his summary. I will use my last round, as five rounds is really too long, merely to thank him for being a worthy opponent.",1,Chrysippus,"
  
At this point, nothing further will be gained by repeating the same arguments. I argue that Yoda's experience, skill, and knowledge make him the odds-on favorite to win; he argues that Luke learned quickly without having a teacher, and that he has awesome skillz.  
  
I compared the two using their duels with Palpatine as a benchmark: Yoda duels him to a stalemate just a few years before Yoda DIES OF EXTREME OLD AGE; Luke loses to him twice (while Palpatine is old and tired, and the second time old, DEAD and tired) and only wins the last time because his sister was there to assist.  
  
I point out that all the Force abilities Luke is learning are things known to the Jedi before the purge; undoubtedly Yoda knows them, since he spent over 700 years teaching them to the new Jedi. My opponent refuses to concede this, as is his right; but the truth is Luke has nothing on Yoda.  
  
My opponent claims Luke is stronger in the Force than Yoda; I have already refuted this - you need look no father than the official Wiki, where Yoda is listed as one of the three greatest Jedi to ever live, and one of the most powerful Force users ever.  
  
  http://starwars.wikia.com...  
First two sentences: ""Yoda was one of the most renowned and powerful Jedi Masters in galactic history. He was known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force and skills in lightsaber combat.""  
  
Third paragraph: ""...arguably the Order's greatest master of the Force and most skilled warrior...""  
  
Powers and Abilities, first two sentences: ""Considered the greatest Jedi Master of the era by many, Yoda was one of the most skilled users of the Force in the history of the galaxy. Indeed the Grand Master was so strong in the Force that he demonstrated the ability to effortlessly disarm the powerful Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress, who was known to have defeated Jedi Council Masters, with a simple gesture.""  
  
That is the debate in a nutshell.  
  
I make no new arguments this round. My opponent's points are only relevant if one disregards everything I wrote. Sure, Luke learns Shatterpoint. Sure, luke does, eventually, finally, defeat the old dead Emperor. Sure, Luke has a high midichlorian count. None of that matters if he cannot match up to Yoda in skill, attunement to the Force, or experience in dueling.

For more than 800 years, he was the greatest Force wielder and the wisest Jedi in the galaxy, renowned as one of the three greatest Jedi to have ever lived. At the age of 30, Luke re-formed the Order around 11 ABY; he assumed the title of Grand Master around 36 ABY, and died at some point well before 137 ABY. Luke was a Jedi Master for less than 100 years. Assuming we are matching these two in their prime, Yoda has 700+ years of experience more than Luke has. 2. Knowledge Yoda spent upwards of 800 years as a Jedi Master, teaching many generations of Jedi Knights. Through those years, he had unlimited access to the vast Library in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, with all the books, artifacts, and holocrons the Order had accumulated over the millennia. He spent centuries learning from and teaching some of the greatest Jedi Masters of all time. Luke did not have access to any of this knowledge. He was forced into action after mere months of informal training under an old and dying master, and spent a large amount of his career scouring the galaxy for fragments of Jedi lore that Palpatine missed in the purge. Despite his best efforts, he could hardly have recovered more than a tiny fraction of the knowledge that was lost. The finer points of dueling were lost with the masters that knew them; those that could have mentored him in the classic forms were either killed in the Clone Wars and the Purge (Form II, Dooku; Form VII, Windu) or died before they had the chance to teach him more than the basics (Form III, Kenobi; Form IV, Yoda). Force Lighting, an attack Luke struggled to defend against for most of his career, was obviously not a problem for Jedi Masters before the purge; Yoda and Windu are both shown redirecting it without taking damage - Yoda doing so with his bare hands. The Library was destroyed shortly before Luke's birth, and he struggled all his life to attain the basic knowledge that a few months in it's halls could have given him. Yoda's Force abilities were naturally great, but were also highly trained over centuries with all the knowledge of the Order at his disposal. Luke learned most of his abilities by instinct or by experimentation; his development was hindered by his lack of training. Many of the abilities he learned, such as generating Force Storms, he learned from his enemies. Yoda mastered all of the lightsaber fighting forms, learning them in the mature, polished form that 3000 years of combat use had given; and he used those forms effectively against many enemies who were also trained to a high level. Luke learned the basics, and learned the rest by trial and error; mostly against backwater foes and rustic Sith Lord - wannabes. The few times in his early career that he faced against a truly formidable opponent, he either lost or required back-up to win. As good as he eventually got, its clear he never quite made it into Yoda's league. 3. Character Yoda is noted for having utter control over his emotions at all times, fighting dispassionately and without ever giving in to the Dark Side. His power was more than a match for even the strongest of the Dark Side users he dueled. Luke, in his considerably shorter history, was rather more impulsive and passionate. He had difficulty at times avoiding the Dark Side, actually going over at at least one point. It wasn't until late in his career that he finally gained a level of control over his emotions and was able to fight calmly. In short: Luke had great potential, and a very distinguished career, but he was hampered by his lack of training and the loss of the accumulated knowledge of the Oder. Had he been given the same training and mentoring Yoda received, and had he lived a few more centuries, he might have eclipsed the old Grandmaster. As it was, should Yoda and Luke ever have met in a duel, Luke would be overwhelmed by Yoda's greater skill and experience. I return this debate to my opponent. <URL>... <URL>...",1,Chrysippus,"

Clearly, if a retributive system deters crime, why would the crime rate be so high? Another problem with rehabilitation in prisons is that it actually encourages criminals to commit crime. In general, criminals come from poor communities without a real chance for much more. Rehabilitation offers them a chance to get an education This is a reckless assumption that is not backed by stats. Education in America is also paid for by taxes, so there is no reason why someone should not be able to go to school plus student loans are always an option. Furthermore, my opponent fails to understand what rehabilitation is, as in rehab they don't teach you job skills, but how to quit drug and alcohol addictions. Justice is lost in a rehabilitative prison system. My opponent continues to misunderstand what rehabilitation really is. My opponent also makes the claim that prisoners must be punished in order to receive justice. However, as I pointed out in R1 a system focused on rehabilitation will not get rid of punishment entirely, criminals will still be punished. However, they must be punished fairly and be given a chance to contribute to society (which is what justice is about). The final problem with rehabilitation is the public opinion. According to Peter Standford, the public opinion is that criminals are bad and will always be bad. Public opinion should have no say in justice. Furthermore, seeing as how public opinion is against criminals, that is an argument in my favour. America needs to give a chance to criminals to show that they have changed, not that they are still criminals. If people get out of jail and everybody is hostile to them, that will only turn them back to crime. Over 75% of people already think that courts are already too easy on criminals. Once again, what people think does not matter in a justice system. I will now move on to my own contentions. C1: REHABILITATION REDUCES CRIME Rehabilitation as opposed to harsher punishments is more effective at reducing crime levels. Our current system puts criminals into miserable cells with other criminals where they learn how to become better criminals. 2/3rds of criminals leaving jail will reoffend within 3 years with a more serious crime. [2] Experiments done in San Francisco jails show that a more intensive therapy and rehab program reduced re-offending rates by 83% and reduced crime in the jail to zero [2]. Clearly, teaching prisoners how to quit addictions, become a better person, and to take responsibility for their actions will help them contribute back to society, instead of being imprisoned over and over. Norway has a supreme amount of focus on rehabilitative justice system and has a per capita murder rate of 0.6, while the US has a per capita murder rate of 4.8. [3] One argument is enough to fulfill my BOP and affirm the resolution. A rehabilitative justice system will reduce crime, so prisons need to focus more on rehab. I look forward to my opponent's response! Sources <URL>... <URL>... <URL>...",1,ishallannoyyo,"
  
  
  I thank my opponent for his comments.   
  In a traditional prison system that focuses on punishment, criminals are deterred from committing crimes because they fear the punishment.

607,"I would like to start off by thanking Con for his response. However I was slightly offended when Con called my debates/polls troll debates/polls. In addition to this, Con really gets of topic. This debate is titled: ""I should be the dictator of DDO"". Anyway, I will proceed to respond to Con's arguments. ""You have no power base with which you can overthrow DDO leadership and you have presented no plan of action."" This debate is not about HOW I should take power. Its about IF I should take power. ""Who exactly?"" One example of a president of DDO who was a bully and a troll is Imabench. ""Seeing as you have no support your only other option is force. You have presented no plan to seize power."" This debate is about IF I should seize power, not HOW I should seize power. ""Freedo has already been installed as dictator and he has the support of the people."" A) That forum you showed to support this is barely a page long. B) He has no power. The current leader of DDO is Airmax. C) That forum says that Freedo is an Emperor, not a dictator. Therefor, this is not an argument. Con did not even say how many people voted for him as opposed to how many people voted for others. For all I know, Freedo may have just barely won the election. ""He clocks in with over, an impressive 20500 forum posts indicating networking and contribution to the site gaining support compared to your 150ish and an ELO ranking more than 800 points above your own."" This is mainly because he has been on DDO much longer than I have. He has been corrupting and ruining this website for far too long. ""You have not explained how you will attempt to challenge the current powers."" Why are you so interested in my plan? What, so you can report my revolution before it even begins? ""What website are you going to?"" I'm going to DDO. ""You cite a poll that limits the election to cold war leaders with 19 total votes for Joseph Stalin."" That's not the point! The point is that people believe that a dictator is more capable of solving DDO's problems than a president. ""Also you have done your fair share of spamming and trolling yourself. You spammed 6+ finish the sentence debates and Stalingrad debates and you have linked to two of your own troll debates in your opening argument."" OK, first of all, Con does not present any evidence of this. Second, there is nothing wrong with making 6+ debates on topics that you really enjoy. You see I support a free DDO. However there are those who try to limit what you can debate and how many times you can debate it. This action takes away freedom of speech. I want to abolish these harsh laws. ""You are currently losing the debate 6-0..."" Both of those people who voted on that debate only voted in order to make me lose. They provided no reasons for why they voted so I doubt that they even read the debate at all. Both of those votes are invalid. ""Wait.... What? You're going to have to expand on this. In your link you argue that 10 debates in 24 hours is restrictive. More than 10 debates in 24 hours is arguably spamming which you said you are against."" Tell me this Con. Who decided that more than 10 debates is spamming? Why was the rule made that exactly 10 debates is spamming? Why not 9 or 11? ""In the debate you defend spammers and trolls whom you have promised to eradicate from the site."" No, my side was that smearing the blood of trolls and spammers was too inhumane of a punishment. ""You have only offered empty promises to purge spammers and trolls while spamming and trolling yourself."" OK Con clearly has incorrecti definitions of spamming and trolling. Until he finds a dictionary, I can not respond to this argument. ""So far I'm not convinced you could fight your way out of a paper bag."" I could do that too. ""You've presented no plan of action."" Because this debate is about whether I should be the dictator. ""You have linked to your own troll debates and promised to end trolling and spamming while regularly doing these things yourself."" I made no troll debates. Some of the debates that you linked to were started not by me, but by others. ""Good luck with the revolution!!!"" Thank you. OK, I will now produce more arguments to support my position. The first argument is this poll on which people voted on. Con largely exageratted the number of people who hate me and consider my a troll. This poll will show otherwise. <URL>... Another poll that I made shows the speed with which I will transform DDO for greater good. I won this poll due to the fact that people believed this. The Stalinmobile was victorious in this race. <URL>... This last poll shows how much I care about the opinions of DDO users. I want to improve DDO for the good and the fact that I made this poll shows that not only do I care about the opinions of major debaters and pollers, I also care about the opinions of spammers and trolls. <URL>... Con fails to realize that I only want to purge the spammers and trolls who can no longer be helped in any way. There is always a chance that current Spammers and Trolls can still be changed for the better. Conclusion: Con's arguments did not really support his position.

610,"Framework for this debate: There are a couple of things that must be outlined before I refute my opponent's arguments. First, my opponent has agreed with the definitions that I have provided for Atheism and Christianity. As such, in order to prove that Christianity is an accurate representation of reality, the Pro must prove the following claims: 1) The Christian God exists, and he is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. 2) This God created the universe and everything in it 3) This God has sent his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth in order to absolve humanity of original sin 4) Jesus has died for the sins of humanity, and was resurrected three days later to live again If my opponent cannot prove that all of these things are true, then he cannot win this debate. I will address this after each round. Second, it is important to note that atheism does not have a burden of proof. Given that the definition of atheism is ""the lack of belief in a higher power"", there aren't any claims that are being made that must be justified. As such, I am only required to negate my opponent's arguments and defend the status quo; I am not required to prove that God does not exist . Addressing the Pro's arguments: Before I begin, I'd first like to point out that there aren't really any arguments that are being made. My opponent instead listed reasons as to why he believes in Christianity, which doesn't really pertain to the resolution, ""Christianity is an accurate representation of reality"". I am not required to address these, but I will anyways, because the reasons that he gave are illogical nonetheless. 1 & 2 (You can't prove that God DOESN'T exist): Irrelevant. Anyone who uses this argument to defend the existence of a God doesn't know how the burden of proof works. Religion, whether it be Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, or even Scientology, is making a claim that a God exists. Thus, it is religion's job to prove that this claim is true. It is not the job of the negative side to prove otherwise. This logical fallacy is known as the argumentum ad ignorantiam (argument from ignorance). This fallacy asserts that a position is true because it has not yet been proven false. Consider the following scenario: Me: I have a unicorn inside this box! You: Why can't I see it? Me: He's invisible. You: Why can't I hear it? Me: He's a quiet unicorn. You: That box is too small to fit a unicorn inside. Me: He's a tiny unicorn. You: Why can't I feel him? Me: He teleports away whenever someone gets too close. You: Alright, can you PROVE that this unicorn exists? Me: YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT HE DOESN'T!!! Would you consider that last statement to be a valid argument in support of the unicorn existing? I didn't think so. 3. Science supports religion. I am not required to address this claim because the Pro didn't explain it at all. The Pro didn't give me cited material, or even make a specific claim. I'm sure later on in the debate, the Pro will make more specific claims and cite material to justify them, but before that happens, I must caution my opponent to please only cite legitimate scientific journals. If they're peer-reviewed, that would be even better. 4. Christianity can benefit you as a person. Although this isn't true in every case (Adolf Hitler, for example), this still doesn't pertain to the truth of the claims that are being made. 5. I would rather believe in God than not. My opponent stated that this was only his opinion, so I don't feel the need to address this. Before I end this round, here is the status of the debate: The Pro must prove: 1) The Christian God exists, and he is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. The status quo stands 2) This God created the universe and everything in it The status quo stands 3) This God has sent his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth in order to absolve humanity of original sin The status quo stands 4) Jesus has died for the sins of humanity, and was resurrected three days later to live again The status quo stands I'm looking forward to the rest of this debate.",1,Mrparkers,"

612,"As agreed upon my opponent and I will debate the validity of a manuscript titled ""Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe"" by Harrit et al. published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal in 2012. (1,2) Before the debate starts my opponent says he only wants to debate the validity of the science, and I have agreed that we can do this. However, the fact that this article was published in the first place in this journal is a point that needs to be given some background too. I do not want this information to sway any voters but it is important to realize this article has a history. Firstly, the publication led to the resignation of the editor in chief Prof. Marie-Paule Pilenias. This was die to the manuscript been published without her permission, as editor of the journal she had final say and that something got published without her permission means it should never have been published.(3,4) Additionally, this journal has no impact factor, which is corroborated by Bentham the journal publishers.(5) This is relevant, as this journal then is not an accredited source of information in the scientific community. Now, onto the debate. In this debate, I will be addressing specific factors of relevance in the various rounds and then give my opponent a chance to reply. In the final round I will summarize my arguments and give some closing thoughts regarding the manuscript. The first point of contention regarding this manuscript is how do we even know if these samples came from the World Trade Center (WTC). The four samples used in this study were collected by non scientists. This means that the samples could have been contaminated as they were not handled properly in an evidence chain by trained scientists. Regardless of this however, a bigger contention regarding these samples is that no effort was made by the authors to verify using a chemical signature that the samples actually came form the WTC buildings. Every material has a specific chemical signal which is determined by the composition of impurities in the material. This means the authors could have validated using chemical signatures from building material at the WTC site whether this building material did come from the WTC. This was not done and as such we have to doubt whether this material was even part of the WTC. This chemical signature could have been very easily verified as the authors even note that ""Fifteen small chips having a total mass of 1.74 mg were extracted from a 1.6 g sample of dust from which readily identifiable glass and concrete fragments had been removed by hand."" So the question is why was the concrete on which this thermite was found not tested to verify its origin? This argument clearly shows that we have to doubt the chain of custody and possible contamination. Additionally, this material may not even come from the WTC as it was not verified using chemical signatures. In the next rounds I will open further arguments casting doubt on the validity of the manuscript. I hand the debate over to my opponent for his first rebuttals. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>... (3) <URL>...

614,Thanks for the argument. But you have misjudged about the topic. You are saying about what happens in an old age home. But the topic is whether old age homes are important in modern world. You have also given a point that supports mine. My opponent said that the parents are being forgotten away by the children and that the children are not willing to care of their parents and hence move away from them. This point is related to the point i have given in the previous round which supports the statement that these old age homes are very important. Please read my previous argument once more. We know that when children leave their parents these parents would be alone in their homes. The staying of these old parents at home has greatly larger disadvantages. There would be only some protection for these old people since some has memory loss and some has problems in vision. So this would lead to many problems. Also they cannot fight a burglar if one enters into the homes. So we can see that there is no protection for these old people in their homes. This is also the place where the old age homes come in. These old age homes provide much and more protection to these old people than that of their homes. This is because here in these old age homes there would be probably a large number of people who can depend on each other. There may be also volunteers here who care for this old people. Today the protection is doubled since most of these old age homes are run down by many religious communities. Thus old age homes are important in modern society. As i have said earlier the love of these children towards their parents are decreasing. They wish to leave their parents as soon as possible. But i am not like that. So when they move away from parents they would leave them at home. Since there are old age homes these children leave their parents here since they provide more protection. So hope that you understood this and would come with your arguments in the next round.........,1,josealways123,"

We know that when children leave their parents these parents would be alone in their homes. The staying of these old parents at home has greatly larger disadvantages. There would be only some protection for these old people since some has memory loss and some has problems in vision. So this would lead to many problems. Also they cannot fight a burglar if one enters into the homes. So we can see that there is no protection for these old people in their homes.  
  
This is also the place where the old age homes come in. These old age homes provide much and more protection to these old people than that of their homes. This is because here in these old age homes there would be probably a large number of people who can depend on each other. There may be also volunteers here who care for this old people. Today the protection is doubled since most of these old age homes are run down by many religious communities. Thus old age homes are important in modern society.  
  
As i have said earlier the love of these children towards their parents are decreasing. They wish to leave their parents as soon as possible. But i am not like that. So when they move away from parents they would leave them at home. Since there are old age homes these children leave their parents here since they provide more protection.  
  
So hope that you understood this and would come with your arguments in the next round.........",People,2,Old-age-homes-are-necessary-in-modern-world./1/,39698

619,"Ladies and gentlemen. I would like to point out that my opponent (pro) has not only misunderstood my argument in round 1, but surprisingly misread his own argument in round 1. To quote part of his argument in Round 1, it goes as follows: ""In this debate I will try to prove that Australian education should be same throughout the nation"" Although this is not a very precisely given resolution, we can still gather that his resolution stands clear: Pro's Resolution : The Australian "" education "" should be the same throughout the nation . NOT that the Australian education system should be the same throughout the entire nation. He used the New South Wales education system to support his claim, but did not put that forth as his resolution for this entire debate. To prove my point, here are some further quotes from his Round 1 argument: ""As the affirmative i define the topic as a possible way to change australian education system for the good of the nation."" This above quote relates to the already given topic. Therefore, we can already conclude that my arguments still stand clear and all of PRO's rebuttals are merely red herrings to my arguments. He has failed to understand his own resolution that was submitted in the first round. Just to point out my point further, one of pro's arguments was not only irrelevant to his side of this debate, but was a supporting argument for Con. He has proven that the New South Wales education system caters for students of a variety of levels, which therefore leads us to the following question: ""Which education should be used as the one for the entire nation?"" The education system in New South Wales is very complicated, with levels suited for people who are GAT and students who are not even up to the same level as an average expected standard. Pro also claims that immigrants still suffer from the current education system. However, he is not completely right in this statement. Within normal government-funded schools, there is an ESL (English as Second Language) system branched out to students who are in need for such treatment. Unfortunately, Pro has once again mistaken my final argument as invalid. However, as it follows the topic of this debate, I am indeed arguing towards my own resolution. It goes as follows: Con's Resolution : The Australian education should remain the same and have a variety of styles with education. Readers must realise by now how mistaken Pro has been with his own topic of this debate. I have put forth arguments that relate to the topic of this debate and my opponent has failed to do so. My argument stand forth and Pro must argue against them. REBUTTALS: While Pro has argued that New South Wales has the ""hardest"" education system in whole of Australia, I think he was trying to say that New South Wales has the best achieving students (as an average). If this is his point, I would like to just prove to him just how wrong he is. [1] The scores of the NAPLAN prove that states such as Victoria or ACT are either achieving similar, if not better results than NSW. My opponent has also failed to realise that he wishes to prove why all of the education should imitate those of NSW to ""benefit the nation"". I wish to point out that Australia is actually one of the lowest scoring nations compared to all the other countries. The education in Asian countries are far ahead of those in Australia. This means, it will not be benefitting our nation that much at all. EXTEND ALL ARGUMENTS.

623,"Unfortunately my opponent has forfeited his round, so I will just provide my arguments. Using these definitions - Good - Benefit or advantage to someone or something. Bad - Not such as to be hoped for or desired; unpleasant or unwelcome. Technology- The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry. Machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge. The branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences. All I have to do is prove that technological advances can be a benefit or advantage to someone or something. I will be providing two benefits to society that technology has brought about. P1) Medical technology This one is quite obvious. At least a single person in the world has benefited from advances in medical technology, whether it be a new invention or an upgrade of an older one. A simple example of this would be cold and allergy medicine. I personally have extremely bad allergies and medicines such as Mucinex have allowed me to breathe easier. P2) The internet The boom of the Internet in recent years has lead to an age of knowledge and possibilities. With just a click of a button you can learn an incredibly large amount of information, such that has never been seen before. It gives people the ability to educate themselves, from their own home [1] ""In classrooms interactive boards and the availability of computers to students are allowing for a new way of teaching that is much more interactive than traditional methods. With the integration of tablet PCs into the classroom in recent years this adds further possibilities for interactive learning. This allows for more effective learning as the students get to engage in the learning process instead of traditionally just struggling to stay concentrated on listening to their teacher. Although technology designed for educational use is still in its relatively early stages, it is clear that it is having a major positive impact. Evidence of its positive impact is how education is beginning to rely on the Internet. This once again emphasises the power of technology and that technology will be integrated into all areas where it is of benefit. Just think of the possibilities!"" As you can see, technology is the closest thing humans have to a superpower, and the possibilities of what we can do with it are endless. At least a single person in existence has benefited from technology, anyone on this site has benefited from it, as they are now able to quickly and easily discuss and debate with people from all around the world.

Bad - Not such as to be hoped for or desired; unpleasant or unwelcome.  
  
Technology-  
The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry.  
  
Machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.  
  
The branch of knowledge dealing with engineering or applied sciences.  
  
All I have to do is prove that technological advances can be a benefit or advantage to someone or something. I will be providing two benefits to society that technology has brought about.  
  
P1) Medical technology  
  
This one is quite obvious. At least a single person in the world has benefited from advances in medical technology, whether it be a new invention or an upgrade of an older one. A simple example of this would be cold and allergy medicine. I personally have extremely bad allergies and medicines such as Mucinex have allowed me to breathe easier.  
  
P2) The internet  
  
The boom of the Internet in recent years has lead to an age of knowledge and possibilities. With just a click of a button you can learn an incredibly large amount of information, such that has never been seen before. It gives people the ability to educate themselves, from their own home [1] ""In classrooms interactive boards and the availability of computers to students are allowing for a new way of teaching that is much more interactive than traditional methods. With the integration of tablet PCs into the classroom in recent years this adds further possibilities for interactive learning. This allows for more effective learning as the students get to engage in the learning process instead of traditionally just struggling to stay concentrated on listening to their teacher.  
  
Although technology designed for educational use is still in its relatively early stages, it is clear that it is having a major positive impact. Evidence of its positive impact is how education is beginning to rely on the Internet. This once again emphasises the power of technology and that technology will be integrated into all areas where it is of benefit. Just think of the possibilities!""  
  
As you can see, technology is the closest thing humans have to a superpower, and the possibilities of what we can do with it are endless. At least a single person in existence has benefited from technology, anyone on this site has benefited from it, as they are now able to quickly and easily discuss and debate with people from all around the world.

They assert that in order to meet the full definition of the word, we have to 'Impart knowledge of *OR* skill in ; give instruction in'. They go on to CHANGE the definition to 'To impart knowledge of *AND* skill in ; give instruction in'. I CAN select which one in this sense that teach is referring to, as it says OR, not AND. As far as to give instruction in, yes. We are educating what creationism is. We teach them how to analyze the idea, in order to better understand past societies. Again, I do NOT have to meet the idea of teaching a skill. This is an OR definition ; my opponent should have provided a better definition if they didn't want to play by this one. On to my opponents rebuttals -Contention 1- My opponent says that it must be taught as FACT. Is that why we teach philosophies in psychology as fact? Or political views as fact? Or religious studies as fact? The answer is NO. This is just a false assertion. My opponent further says that if I think it's important to teach creationism, shouldn't I also be concerned with teaching the world was flat? Because arguing for the teaching in a historical sense of people thinking the world is flat is ATOPICAL. This is IRRELEVANT to the current debate and should be ignored. Further, he says there's evidence against it. That's GOOD. This supports the idea that not everyone in history has had ideas that were RIGHT. We still teach that medicine men would bleed out the sick in order to remove tainted blood. This is FACT. The part that is WRONG is that tainted blood isn't the cause of all illness, and bleeding out doesn't assist in this. In addition, he talks about holocaust denial as a theory, and etc. These are no where near as relevant as something that existed and was vital to society for THOUSANDS OF YEARS. He also mentions the geocentric theory ; We do teach about it. High school teachers teach about Copernicus and Galileo. Geocentric Theory is TAUGHT in order to provide for better comprehension. We provide their reasons because it assists in knowledge ; SCHOOLS NEED NOT ASSERT IT AS FACT. ONLY THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED FACT. -Contention 2- My opponent basically claims that it's atypical. This is wrong. Because we can use past examples of BAD EVIDENCE or LACK OF EVIDENCE, it helps form a more modern way of thinking. Yes, a lot of people in this world DO hold creationist beliefs today ; I'm not debating to protect peoples' feelings. I'm here to present the facts and reasons. This contention stands as other than making a false assertion of atopicality, he only goes on to say that it has nothing to do with the scientific method ; okay? It still serves as an EXAMPLE of BAD EVIDENCE OR LACK OF EVIDENCE being used to ASSERT something as FACT. On to my opponent's case 1 Creationism vs Evolution My opponent asserts that this is contention is basic. Because he provides NOTHING to argue against, I'll use what I'm assuming is his argument. He automatically assumes that we can only teach ONE or THE OTHER. We can teach one for better understand, ie, creationism, and the other as fact, ie, evolution. These are powerful tools when used TOGETHER, in teaching both SCIENCE and HISTORY. This argument falls ; Schools need not teach one or the other ; it's best to teach BOTH in PROPER CONTEXT. 2. Separation of Church and State My opponent basically is arguing against teaching creationism because there's so many types of creationism from different cultures. This is IRRELEVANT. When talking about Europe in history, we refer to CATHOLICISM and PROTESTANTISM, because these were CULTURALLY RELEVANT of the time. As far as for a science perspective, my opponent once again ASSERTS we must PICK which CREATION STORY we teach. This is, again, false. We can teach the IDEA OF CREATIONISM without teaching the STORIES OF IT. We can teach it as it has been shown throughout history. Basically, the easiest way to destroy this argument is to ACKNOWLEDGE that we do NOT need to teach it as FACT. This EDUCATION of creationism doesn't infringe on separation of church and state ; It's necessary to be taught in history classes to understand historic actions, from the crusaders, the the witch hunt trials, to the Spanish Inquisition. These are VITAL to understand the reasons of the culture. Again, we are NOT arguing that this is teaching it as FACT. Only imparting someone with knowledge. I've shown that this knowledge is demanded to understand history, and is supplementary to understanding the scientific method. He asserts that in order to have a viable field for academia, religious doctrine must stay out ; I've shown that the OPPOSITE is true.

629,"My position is that Islamic advertisements should not be used to make Americans more tolerant of Muslims. Contention 1: There aren't enough choco-chewing fatsos to merit such wasteful use of resources. 1.There are several technical problems with this proposition. This form of advertisement is obviously made to target the intolerant factions within America. Taking a reasonable approach, I'm sure my opponent must realize that not everyone in America are politically uneducated or biased. This also means that we don't really know what number or proportion of America actually needs some form of tolerance-promoting medium for intolerant thoughts/behavior toward the Islamic culture & people. If my opponent cannot prove that the intolerant faction is large enough to merit spending millions to blast subliminal pro-Muslim messages, then this rebuttal stands. 2. If the faction is insubstantial in size, what harm would it do in the larger political sphere? The US, now edging toward a $20 trillion debt, is nearly in no position to actually effect unjust culture-based military or social bias. This is clear in the citizens' overwhelming support for retracting soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan. The current political opinions lean toward a regressing US involvement in world-policing. Even Republicans, known for their quasi-imperialist statutes in much earlier years, are working to enhance the UN, not the US's, ability to voice and enforce political & socioeconomic justice. This potentially small party of racist are no cause for harm. 3. The US educational & cultural environment is already permeated with a tolerance-promoting atmosphere. According to several polls, the majority of the United States is currently more tolerant than intolerant. This means that the number of racists are far outnumbered by the number of non-racists. In fact, just in the last decade, the LGBT (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender) community has, in the form of popular public opinion gained landmark rights of equality that they never would have had 50 years ago. The fact is, the gargantuan boned critics of America are a dwindling species. This being so, there really is no need to worry about putting on TV ads for a majority who already agree with the ads' positions. It's a waste of resources. Contention 2: Is TV really the right medium? Pro: ""So that's what I want to debate today, whether Islamic advertisements should be used to make Americans more tolerant of muslims."" Response: Let's look at how this was worded. PRO wants to use Islamic advertisements to... (wait wait, Islamic advertisements?) ...make Americans more tolerant of Muslims. Are you kidding me? That's like saying you want to send emails with your garbage can. While sending e-mails is a good idea, the garbage can is the wrong medium. 99% of Americans do not have any knowledge of the Islamic language, let alone understand long drawn-out social ads. It'd therefore be both impractical and expensive to place these alien ads in such a way as to have them be presented to the entirety of the 96.7% of the 360,000,000 Americans living in the US with TV's. You could feed millions starving African children for a year with this money. You could clean up a good chunk of the environment, subsidize lumber companies and stall the destruction of the Amazon. You could provide the poor with enough to get by for quite a while. You could save lives! Why would you waste it getting these astronomical-ice-cream-tubbing tubbies to give grudging approval of Islam?! Who cares about their worthless approval? Think of the starving African children! That aside, TV is losing its sphere of influence. Statistically, more people prefer the internet over the TV. People don't even watch TV on TV anymore, they do it on the internet. With millions... billions of hours of declining television viewership, there is no reason to believe that the ad will actually have significant impact. The internet is the way to go. Another point: These people have months and years of built-up bias (12 years approximately since 9-11, possibly even more stemming from before), do you really think 30 seconds of promotional advertisements would be able to reverse that? Contention 3: There is no reason for anything. Let's create a chain in which we find whether or not tolerance, the end of which my opponent, through TV ads, theoretical achieves, is objectively imperative. We'll start with the first link of the chain: 1.'Islamic Advertisements should be used to make Americans more tolerant of muslims' Why is this important? 2. Tolerance creates a better environment for society; people are better able to coexist, to live in peace and to be happy. What makes happiness and coexistence, a potential tenet for survival, important? 3. Survival and happiness are important for the well-being of humanity How is the well-being and humanity of any objective importance? 4. It is not, people want to survive. We want to live in peace and happiness, what's wrong with that? Nothing is wrong, freedom of speech bro. It's just that the chain ends in the subjective 'want'. Since it is subjective, it cannot, by definition, be, to any degree, imperative. The means proposed (Islamic TV ads) cannot be justified since the end (tolerance) is of no importance whatsoever. Therefore Islamic advertisements to make Americans more tolerant of Muslims should not be implemented. If PRO cannot offer any substantial reasoning for tolerance, then the proposition falls and CON wins.",1,Beginner,"

Contention 2: Is TV really the right medium?  
Pro: ""So that's what I want to debate today, whether Islamic advertisements should be used to make Americans more tolerant of muslims.""  
Response: Let's look at how this was worded. PRO wants to use Islamic advertisements to... (wait wait, Islamic advertisements?) ...make Americans more tolerant of Muslims. Are you kidding me? That's like saying you want to send emails with your garbage can. While sending e-mails is a good idea, the garbage can is the wrong medium. 99% of Americans do not have any knowledge of the Islamic language, let alone understand long drawn-out social ads. It'd therefore be both impractical and expensive to place these alien ads in such a way as to have them be presented to the entirety of the 96.7% of the 360,000,000 Americans living in the US with TV's. You could feed millions starving African children for a year with this money. You could clean up a good chunk of the environment, subsidize lumber companies and stall the destruction of the Amazon. You could provide the poor with enough to get by for quite a while. You could save lives! Why would you waste it getting these astronomical-ice-cream-tubbing tubbies to give grudging approval of Islam?! Who cares about their worthless approval? Think of the starving African children!  
That aside, TV is losing its sphere of influence. Statistically, more people prefer the internet over the TV. People don't even watch TV on TV anymore, they do it on the internet. With millions... billions of hours of declining television viewership, there is no reason to believe that the ad will actually have significant impact. The internet is the way to go. Another point: These people have months and years of built-up bias (12 years approximately since 9-11, possibly even more stemming from before), do you really think 30 seconds of promotional advertisements would be able to reverse that?  
  
Contention 3: There is no reason for anything.  
Let's create a chain in which we find whether or not tolerance, the end of which my opponent, through TV ads, theoretical achieves, is objectively imperative.  
We'll start with the first link of the chain:  
  
1.'Islamic Advertisements should be used to make Americans more tolerant of muslims'  
  
Why is this important?  
  
2. Tolerance creates a better environment for society; people are better able to coexist, to live in peace and to be happy.  
  
What makes happiness and coexistence, a potential tenet for survival, important?  
  
3. Survival and happiness are important for the well-being of humanity  
  
How is the well-being and humanity of any objective importance?  
  
4. It is not, people want to survive. We want to live in peace and happiness, what's wrong with that?  
  
Nothing is wrong, freedom of speech bro. It's just that the chain ends in the subjective 'want'. Since it is subjective, it cannot, by definition, be, to any degree, imperative. The means proposed (Islamic TV ads) cannot be justified since the end (tolerance) is of no importance whatsoever.  
Therefore Islamic advertisements to make Americans more tolerant of Muslims should not be implemented.  
  
If PRO cannot offer any substantial reasoning for tolerance, then the proposition falls and CON wins.",Society,0,Islamic-advertisements-on-the-television./1/,31293

637,"I am sorry to Con and to our readers for forfeiting the last round, I was swamped with work and unable to write my response in time. In closing, I would like to offer a brief summary of this debate, as well as addressing new points that Con brought up in the final round. Con makes a single argument, stating: ""I believe it is very clear Pro has an out-dated clich view on the Muslim face veil."" Does Con provide any source for this claim? The Qu'ran. What does the Qu'ran say? Absolutely nothing about the face veil, because the Qu'ran does not require it to be worn. That is the key to this debate. The ""authoritative Islamic sources"" that Con repeatedly refers to is the Qu'ran. But the Qu'ran does not argue in favor of the face veil! It explicitly says that we should not compel anyone to do anything. The Qu'ran in essence gives people freedom from having to wear the face veil. Con admits this point. Take a look at Con's final quote from Tawakul Karman: ""Man in the early times was almost naked, and as his intellect evolved he started wearing clothes. What I am today and what I'm wearing represents the highest level of thought and civilization that man has achieved, and is not regressive. It's the removal of clothes again that is regressive back to ancient times."" Exactly! Clothes represent something. That was what I argued. I am not saying we should be naked. I'm saying that what you wear matters. If someone wears a Nazi uniform, and is a neo-Nazi, they will not be able to integrate in Western society. Notice that the majority of Western nations outlaw Nazism of any kind. Holocaust denial is outlawed as well. I have argued what the face veil represents: female seclusion and patriarchal tyranny. Con has not adequately challenged the historical and academic sources I have provided. I want to make sure readers understand what Con has argued. Con has NOT argued that the face veil does not represent female seclusion. Con has argued that Islam does not require that women wear the face veil. So what? That is not at issue. What Islam permits or does not permit is irrelevant; what is relevant is what the face veil ITSELF represents historically, culturally, and socially. Asking if Islam permits it is irrelevant, what is relevant is whether the West would permit it. Given the negative Western view for patriarchal tyranny, it is clear the face veil poses a problem for anyone attempting to integrate in the West, as the West would not accept the face veil as a component of its culture. It simply would not happen, given what the veil represents. That's all there is to say.",1,FourTrouble,"

I have argued what the face veil represents: female seclusion and patriarchal tyranny. Con has not adequately challenged the historical and academic sources I have provided.  
  
I want to make sure readers understand what Con has argued. Con has NOT argued that the face veil does not represent female seclusion. Con has argued that Islam does not require that women wear the face veil. So what? That is not at issue. What Islam permits or does not permit is irrelevant; what is relevant is what the face veil ITSELF represents historically, culturally, and socially. Asking if Islam permits it is irrelevant, what is relevant is whether the West would permit it. Given the negative Western view for patriarchal tyranny, it is clear the face veil poses a problem for anyone attempting to integrate in the West, as the West would not accept the face veil as a component of its culture. It simply would not happen, given what the veil represents. That's all there is to say.",Society,3,The-Islamic-face-veil-is-a-barrier-to-integration-in-the-West./1/,60148

I actually don't quite see why I need to argue this point, as it may differ from person to person. However, in school, a subject is something such as Social Studies or Language Arts where you learn something in particular (1). At no point does it, or should it, say homework. Therefore, homework is not a subject, which proves your resolution that ""homework is a very important subject"" false. Your said resolution in the first round has failed to be met.

If I am not mistaken, school itself is about learning and testing, correct? So why can't homework be done in school? The average school period is about 40-50 minuets. This is by far enough time for teachers to get the things on their lists done. Homework is mostly things that one has failed to do in class. Furthermore, teachers can test if a student can solve an equation in class easily. After all, shouldn't that be what school is all about? You learn and you solve.

(1) <URL>... --Argument I-- My first and only argument for this round will contain of grades that are linked to homework. Contrary to popular belief, homework can help you score LOWER on tests instead of higher (2). Studies show that in most places, the more the homework, the lower the test score. But why does this happen? It is because of stress levels. Sometimes, stress overwhelms the brain and one can forget things, such as a test. Furthermore, studies show that 29% of 13 year olds spend 2 or more hours on homework (3). Many people who have this have bad grades: ""As an 8th grade student who is in advanced classes, I think that homework is the cause of my depleting grades."" -LaxdoubleK, Colorado As people get older, they have more and more homework and pressure on them.

The banning of homework would result in better test grades, less stress, and more happiness. It would also increase athletics because they would have more time to play sports.

640,"P1: I do agree that legalization of drugs would likely cause increased drug use. But a small increase at most--not a massive influx of new users. Take Portugal, for example. My opponent claims that, ""If drugs are made legal, a new influx of users would be created as people would no longer fear punishment for using drugs."" But the empirical evidence from Portugal's decriminalization of drugs contradicts this. It wasn't the same thing as legalization--producing and trafficking drugs is still illegal--but drug use is no longer punished as a crime. Portuguese drug users ""no longer fear punishment for using drugs."" If my opponent were correct, drug use would increase significantly. But that isn't what happened. Hard drug use stayed approximately the same or decreased overall, and all drug use decreased among youth. [1] Legalization is different from decriminalization, and would likely have somewhat different effects--but my opponent's claim that a lack of punishment for drug use would cause a significant influx of new users is false. P2: As there would be no massive influx of new drug users, this point is irrelevant. In addition, many of the health problems associated with drug use are the result of their illegality, not the drugs themselves. When Portugal decriminalized drugs, drug-related deaths and overdoses decreased dramatically, as did the rate of infections of HIV and other STDs. [1] Legalization would also eliminate health problems associated with drug impurities. Heroin use alone, for example, causes no serious health problems--health problems associated with heroin use are actually because of heroin prohibition, which causes impurities in the drug, and the use of dirty, infected needles. [2] P3: The problem with Con's evidence that drug use hurts workforce productivity is that it fails to take into account other variables. Once those are taken into account, the evidence paints an entirely different picture. Studies have found that illicit drug users actually receive higher wages than non-users. [3] [4] Other studies have found that illicit drug users generally have equally good or better productivity and absentee rates, and equally high or lower health-care costs. [5] [6] [7] Gangs: Con claims that using my logic, we would should also legalize rape and murder. This is false. My logic is that the harm caused by drug prohibition greatly exceeds the harm that a legal market in drugs would cause. That logic could not be applied to legalization of rape or murder, since legalization of those things would obviously cause much greater harm than their continued prohibition. My point stands. Police: Con claims that the abuse of power by police enforcing drug laws has to do with the police themselves, not the laws. This is partially true--there will always be corrupt police--but the drug laws themselves are responsible for a significant amount of the abuse and corruption. The difference between drug laws and laws against things like murder and rape is that murderers leave bodies and rapists leave rape victims. Thieves have stolen stuff. Such people can be found, prosecuted, and convicted without laws that violate the rights of innocent people, because they leave victims and evidence of their crimes. Drug users do not leave victims; they only victimize themselves. Police-state tactics are necessary to fight the drug war because that's the only way the government can find enough evidence to convict people.

Cats are difficult to train, and they usually scratch walls and curtains, unless you buy a scratching pole which cost a lot of money. Also, if the cat ruins the pole, you need to buy another one.

651,"I would advise my opponent be as straightforward as possible, as this can be helpful in reducing misunderstandings. What you attempted to convey in your opening speech, ""that just because one thing is an option isn't a reason to vehemently oppose the other option,"" was unclear and was never explicitly said. That being said, there were a few problems with the rest of his argument. Refutations: ""I am yet to see a sufficient rebuttal to this point as all my opponent has tried to do is disregard it altogether as invalid which it is most certainly not."" I never once said that my opponent's points were invalid. However, they had nothing to do with the resolution, and were therefore irrelevant to the debate. The resolution is that ""Adoption is not a sufficient reason to be pro-life,"" and my opponent only argued that ""Just because there is an option available to deal with already-born children doesn't mean we must force women to create them."" His point only states that we shouldn't force women to create children. This, however, does not address the resolution, which deals with adoption being a sufficient reason to be pro-life. None of my opponent's arguments show that a pro-lifers reason to be pro-life should not be that adoption is an option. His arguments are simply Pro trying to say that he does not think that adoption is reason enough for his views to be pro-life, not whether or not it should be a sufficient reason for someone who is a potential pro-lifer to see adoption as a sufficient reason for being pro-life. As his points are irrelevant to the resolution, they should be disregarded, just as a point about term limits for elected officials, in this debate, would be disregarded. ""Additionally, the ""case for con"" that my opponent raises is that because the resolution was not ""Adoption is not a sufficient alternative for parents considering abortion.""

In the case for Con, it was never raised that because the resolution was not ""Adoption is not a sufficient alternative for parents considering abortion,"" it justifies adoption as a sufficient reason to be pro-life.

This does not attempt to justify that adoption is a sufficient reason to be pro-life, but only asks Pro to remember what he is supposed to defend, as he has the burden of proof.

  I would advise my opponent be as straightforward as possible, as this can be helpful in reducing misunderstandings. What you attempted to convey in your opening speech, “that just because one thing is an option isn’t a reason to vehemently oppose the other option,” was unclear and was never explicitly said.   That being said, there were a few problems with the rest of his argument.         
  Refutations:  
     ""I am yet to see a sufficient rebuttal to this point as all my opponent has tried to do is disregard it altogether as invalid which it is most certainly not.""        I never once said that my opponent's points were invalid. However, they had nothing to do with the resolution, and were therefore irrelevant to the debate. The resolution is that “Adoption is not a sufficient reason to be pro-life,” and my opponent only argued that “Just because there is an option available to deal with already-born children doesn’t mean we must force women to create them.” His point only states that we shouldn't force women to create children. This, however, does not address the resolution, which deals with adoption being a sufficient reason to be pro-life. None of my opponent’s arguments show that a pro-lifers reason to be pro-life should not be that adoption is an option. His arguments are simply Pro trying to say that he does not think that adoption is reason enough for his views to be pro-life, not whether or not it should be a sufficient reason for someone who is a potential pro-lifer to see adoption as a sufficient reason for being pro-life. As his points are irrelevant to the resolution, they should be disregarded, just as a point about term limits for elected officials, in this debate, would be disregarded.  
     
  “Additionally, the “case for con” that my opponent raises is that because the resolution was not “Adoption is not a sufficient alternative for parents considering abortion.” That this somehow justifies that Adoption is a sufficient reason to be pro-life. This is absolutely false because the are unrelated.”

Over the years we have experienced many ""miracles"" in medicine, many people, even in very recent years and months, who were expected to die, miraculously survived. If these people were to have been subjected to Euthanasia they would be dead now. These incidents have taught us to never lose hope and euthanasia is the very symbol of hopelessness. Contention 2: Hippocratic Oath Traditionally, doctors swear an oath when they receive their medical degree. This oath includes the phrase ""I shall do no harm""; proposing suicide is a direct violation of that oath. Contention 3: Religion My opponent and I are Christians. The vast majority of churches and church bodies, object to Euthanasia. They do so, because Christians believe that ""God gave us life and God should be the one to take it away"". This amongst others, means that no human should have the power of life and death. This is especially true in the case of doctors that may be pessimistic at points and can easily be influenced by third parties, such as health insurance companies (that want to avoid extra funds for treatment being wasted and apply Euthanasia). Contention 4: Pessimism Certain patients, doctors and family may be pessimistic. For example if you tell a patient that he will die in three months because of some disease and that the pain will gradually increase, until he/she dies. This might make them pessimistic and because they might fear the pain, they might choose to be mercy killed in order to avoid it. This will eliminate all slim chances of survival and rob the pessimistic patient of his/her last days with the people he/she loves. Contention 1: Euthanasia furthers human rights My opponent states that it is a human's right to decide to be killed when terminally ill. I agree with this to a certain point. First of all, certain things may effect the patient's and the doctor's judgment. Some examples of this are: pessimism, fear of pain and hopelessness in the case of the patient. Pressure to have funds and treatment rooms cleared for other patient, by hospitals and influence and bribes from health insurance companies (that to avoid extra funds for treatment being wasted and apply Euthanasia) for doctors. The above proves that doctor and patient may make mistakes in judgment that will result in the patient to be subjected to Euthanasia, and since death is irreversible possible mistakes can not be recalled. In conclusion, we might have the right to euthanasia, but we many times be wrong in our judgment and situations like the one explained in my 4th contention may occur, that may cost us our lives (in the worst scenario) or are last days with our family and friends (in the best). Contention 2: Euthanasia is consistent with utilitarianism. True, it is consistent in a way, but utilitarianism is nothing but a philosophical theory and there are many contradictory theories that prove that Euthanasia is immoral. In philosophy you usually can't say that something is wrong of right. For example utilitarianism is no more right or wrong than the philosophical theory of egoism. So, Euthanasia may be consistent with ONE philosophical point of view, utilitarianism [type of consequentialism], but it is contradictory to virtue ethics and deontological ethics as well as some types of consequentialism. Therefore, my opponent's point proves little. Contention 3: Euthanasia is often necessary. My opponent tries to prove his pint by providing one example. In the specific example (dying driver), the right course of action (morally and legally) is to call an ambulance and get him to the hospital and perhaps his life will be saved. Therefore, my opponent's example lacks moral and legal judgment and devalues life and science (medicine), by losing hope to soon and not giving medicine a chance to save a life, (even if chances are that it won 't succeed, the huge value of a human life still makes it worth it!).

659,"Yea, LD rules are good. I too look at Martin Luther King Jr as one of the wisest men to live as of this day. And I full agree with his quote, however, the context in which he said it does not apply to this debate round. Not one type of people as of the status-quo are being suppressed by our ""individualistic concerns"". We are all human, and we all do have individual concerns, its just natural and the way it is. It is ok to strive to fulfill those individual concerns, as long as no one is being put down in the process. When we look to the status-quo we see a judicial system that is working. Lowering ourselves to an international court will take away us autonomy and strip us of the very thing our nation stands on, individuality and independence. Definitions- Thank you for picking definitions that are fair to both sides of the debate, I truly do appreciate it. However, there is a minor problem in your ""crimes against humanity"" definition that I believe works against you. The definition is in context to war. All of those things are crimes against humanity when a country is at war. ""before or during the war"". So by this definition we see that any war at all that a person dies, is a crime against humanity. However, if this is true we see that the United States of America is the biggest offenders of ""crimes against humanity"". Now if you vote for the affirmative team based on these definitions the United States of America will be the first to be imprisoned based on the international code that defines ""crimes against humanity"" as murder that occurs in war. But because I do agree that this is a fair definition, we will keep it. The only thing is that it will hurt the affirmatives case drastically. I believe that Justice is a fair Value, so i am adopting it;the topic essentially calls for this value Your value Criterion is also fair, so I am adopting it, but will work against you in this debate. I will go over this in my case later on, just to keep it organized. Onto his case His first contention essentially says ""America isnt good for C.A.H. but the international court will be"" and, with all due respect, the argument is fundamentally flawed. If you look to who is driving for the international court, we see that it is the US. As of the status-quo, the United States has remained the hegemon and what we say goes. The world follows our norms, our habits, and conforms to what we want them to. When there is an international court, the same will happen. The US will be leading this court and what it says should be punishment will be. The only difference now is that the US has more power to reach around the whole world and not just in the US. So take this argument and completely turn it against the affirmative team. What will happen in an international court is that it will be American lead, and nothing will change from the status-quo except now America has even more power to serve ""injustices"". On his second contention. He says the court will be unbiased. However, if you look to the countries that are currently involved in the ICC, you see that they are just a bunch of random countries that have no pull whatsoever in the world, so of course they will not push their agenda on another country and they see as equals. A number of states, including China, Russia, India and the United States, have not joined the ICC, when the US joins it will push its agenda on the world immediately. The US is the biggest violators of rules, if they were to join they would change the court to what they saw fit. The US sees that the ICC has done absolutely nothing and will make changes to make it ""better"" these changes will push the western agenda. When you see that the affirmative case is self destructive, you cannot vote for it. Upon first reading the arguments you may think his way of thinking is best, however, when you look deeper into his definitions and contentions you see that they work against him, not for him. And my case. Contention 1- The ICC is horrible. The status-quo sees an international court system, and they have gotten absolutely nothing done. Look to the genocides happening in Rwanda and in the DRC. Thousands of people are dying, the people in the lead are not being dealt with. The ICC is just a bunch of random countries that mean nothing to world that are trying to come together. Their efforts are honorable, but the bottom line is that they are getting nothing done even by their own definitions. If they believe that ""murder in war"" is a C.A.H. then the US government should already be in jail. If they think that genocide is a C.A.H. they should have thrown everything they had behind efforts to stop thousands of women and children from being killed in Sub-Saharan Africa today. Contention 2- If the US went into it, they would just mold it to status-quo USA This destroys any reason for the US to succumb to the courts. Nothing would change at all. The USA is the world police status-quo and will continue to follow the same ethics in a world post plan. When this happens there are just more countries following the same ethics that the affirmative thinks is bad So when you look at the details of what will really happen after you affirm the resolution, you see that nothing changes. If anything, more crimes against humanity will be committed because the USA is now at the head of this court system. Thank you affirmative debater, I look forward to hearing a response.",1,fresnoinvasion,"
  
Yea, LD rules are good.  
  
I too look at Martin Luther King Jr as one of the wisest men to live as of this day. And I full agree with his quote, however, the context in which he said it does not apply to this debate round. Not one type of people as of the status-quo are being suppressed by our ""individualistic concerns"". We are all human, and we all do have individual concerns, its just natural and the way it is. It is ok to strive to fulfill those individual concerns, as long as no one is being put down in the process.  
  
When we look to the status-quo we see a judicial system that is working. Lowering ourselves to an international court will take away us autonomy and strip us of the very thing our nation stands on, individuality and independence.  
  
Definitions- Thank you for picking definitions that are fair to both sides of the debate, I truly do appreciate it.  
  
However, there is a minor problem in your ""crimes against humanity"" definition that I believe works against you.  
  
The definition is in context to war. All of those things are crimes against humanity when a country is at war. ""before or during the war"". So by this definition we see that any war at all that a person dies, is a crime against humanity. However, if this is true we see that the United States of America is the biggest offenders of ""crimes against humanity"". Now if you vote for the affirmative team based on these definitions the United States of America will be the first to be imprisoned based on the international code that defines ""crimes against humanity"" as murder that occurs in war.  
  
But because I do agree that this is a fair definition, we will keep it. The only thing is that it will hurt the affirmatives case drastically.  
  
I believe that Justice is a fair Value, so i am adopting it;the topic essentially calls for this value  
Your value Criterion is also fair, so I am adopting it, but will work against you in this debate. I will go over this in my case later on, just to keep it organized.  
  
Onto his case  
  
His first contention essentially says ""America isnt good for C.A.H. but the international court will be"" and, with all due respect, the argument is fundamentally flawed.  
  
If you look to who is driving for the international court, we see that it is the US. As of the status-quo, the United States has remained the hegemon and what we say goes. The world follows our norms, our habits, and conforms to what we want them to. When there is an international court, the same will happen. The US will be leading this court and what it says should be punishment will be. The only difference now is that the US has more power to reach around the whole world and not just in the US. So take this argument and completely turn it against the affirmative team. What will happen in an international court is that it will be American lead, and nothing will change from the status-quo except now America has even more power to serve ""injustices"".  
  
On his second contention.  
  
He says the court will be unbiased. However, if you look to the countries that are currently involved in the ICC, you see that they are just a bunch of random countries that have no pull whatsoever in the world, so of course they will not push their agenda on another country and they see as equals.

Don't we admire people who say ""I am against stealing"" and do not ever steal?"" In any case, fanatical, unquestionable belief in a principle is not good. There are scenarios where stealing would be the right thing to do, there are scenarios where killing another human being would be the right thing to do. Closing yourself to those scenarios and claiming that on a fundamental level these things cannot be done ever, that there are no circumstances under which they should be done - that is not morally admirable. That is simply ignorant and closed-minded. For example, if your children are starving and the only way to feed them is to steal, stealing is very much justified. And, perhaps, if a member of society blows up a schoolbus, it is morally right for society to end that person's life. That is another debate - the important thing is, Protestantism allows its followers to examine the pros and cons and come to whichever decision, whereas Catholicism has decided that if killing is ever wrong, it must therefore ALWAYS be wrong. That may be 'consistent,' but it doesn't follow logically. Everything is not black and white - there is plenty of grey out there. To weigh each scenario on its own, and then to follow the best course of action - that is morally admirable. TWO: While it's true that Catholicism tells people to do good works, it does this by bribing people with some reward. That's not morally admirable. Even so, I have admitted that it isn't all bad - that the increased amount of good works is indeed morally admirable. However, Catholicism does not encourage good works very much more than other Christian sects. No Christian sects tell believers to just act however they want - however, they don't try holding eternal wrath over people's heads to force them into behaving well. While Catholicism has an advantage on the good works it gets people to do, that advantage is ever so slight and is counterbalanced by the fact that bribery is used to make people 'act' moral against their own nature. THREE: Protestantism does not preach extreme individualism. It simply does not put AS MUCH focus on listening to whatever your community (church) wants you to do. Both Catholicism and Protestantism are community-based, just Protestantism is a bit less extreme about it. My opponent paints Protestantism as some self-worship cult, an assertion that is completely unfounded and entirely false. ONE #2: My opponent and I largely agree here. I know that Pastors are given undue authority as well, just not as much as the Pope and other Catholic clergymen (clergy is not seen to have much power in Protestant religions, largely due to the larger focus on actual people and the smaller focus on the church itself). But yes, the advantage Protestantism holds here is slight. TWO #2: I'll concede that my point here was largely irrelevant - though I do have to say one last thing on this point. The real moral qualms that Protestants had were the abuses of power in the Catholic church (like the sale of indulgences and the exclusive preaching in Latin to the detriment of the people). While I admit that those individual things are not part of the religion of Catholicism, they were made possible because Catholicism places so much authority in the Church and its clergy. If Church officials have too much power, they will be more likely to abuse it, especially if everyone's a greedy person on the inside like my opponent says. Protestantism does not give the church major authority over individuals - the power is largely seen to be in the hands of those individuals and in the hands of God (though, admittedly, Protestant officials do have some level of power, just not enough to do very much damage). This point (and the one about the Catholic clergy vs. Protestant church officials) really just augments the other point about individualism vs. community (church).

Yes, Catholicism and Protestantism both say that prayer is effective, but studies have time and time again showed that this is not the case. By praying, people are given a sense that they've somehow done something good when they actually haven't. I agree that this is a problem for both Protestantism and Catholicism, but it is moreso for Catholicism, where there is a much larger focus placed on prayer. I will concede that many other ritualistic parts of Catholicism aren't really all that harmful, though some other rituals do discourage secular thinking.

Summary  
In this debate, I and Pro attempt to discuss if human rights do not have adequate justification under a secular government. My opponent takes the stand of Pro, thereby affirming the resolution while I strives to establish that a secular government would be capable of offering sufficient protections for the human rights. Right from the beginning, I attempted to show that all rights are desire, and there were no objective human rights. After establishing that human rights are, in essences, human desires, I proceeded to stress the point that all rights derives their legitimacy from laws, necessarily ordained by the government. Human rights violation would occur when states decide to run afoul of existing laws in an attempt to maintain their rulings.

670,"The agreed-upon condition of this duel is that both combatants are ""in their prime."" Obviously, this is a hypothetical and nebulous point, since there is no way to know exactly when each was at their best; and the times that seem to fit this best are about 100 - 300 years apart. The only contact Luke and Yoda had (while both were alive, that is) was within a year of the end of Yoda's life. Note that all three of the prequels are set within 37 years of Yoda's death. He is certainly not in his prime; he is in fact very old and tired, and far less agile than he was in his youth. His reflexes are slower, and his judgment clouded by years of Palpatine's machinations. Despite this, he fought brilliantly in the Clone Wars, defeated Dooku in a duel, and fought Palpatine to a draw. When Luke fought Palpatine (at the ages of 23, 28, and 29), he lost twice and only won the last time because he had outside help. If we can compare their strengths by their duels with Palpatine, then, its clear that even when Yoda is old he is still a more capable swordsman than Luke is. How much more when he was in his prime? This duel pits a middle-aged Yoda, at perhaps 600-700 years old, against a middle-aged Luke, at around 40. Note that Luke was 30 years old when he re-founded the Order, and nearly 45 when he took the title Grand Master; many of the techniques of dueling Luke learned had not been recovered at the time he re-founded the order. To defend my original points: 1. No, experience doesn't guarantee success; however, it does make it easier to win if one takes part in a lot of previous duels. Yoda simply has the greater experience fighting, and is more likely to win based on that alone. 2. Yoda's more complete knowledge of the forms of swordfighting is extremely relevant to his duel with Luke; if Yoda is privy to tricks and techniques that Luke never learned, he can pull them out to overwhelm Luke. Luke's comparative ignorance is a strong disadvantage for him. 3. I will concede this point, as it is relatively unimportant to the outcome. _____________________ Now, to address my opponent's new points: 1. Luke does manage to recover some of the techniques used by the old Order. This does not give him an advantage over Yoda, since Yoda knew these techniques already - in the more polished form they had before the purge. The question to ask here is: If he managed, slowly and painfully, to recover these impressive techniques; what other powerful techniques could he have learned if he had lived before the purge, as Yoda did? 2. I've already compared Yoda and Luke as they matched against Palpatine; the point here is that Luke is only notable as a swordsman because he was mostly self-taught. Luke has impressive force capabilities, rivaling Yoda's; his knowledge and experience using the force are slight compared to Yoda, though. Luke has impressive skills with the saber, but it is necessarily a less polished form than Yoda's since he had to invent it himself without the Jedi Order to consult. As for the difference in the saber forms, Yoda was the master of all the forms except VII, and he was present when that was invented. Yoda used Soresu, form IV, which made up for his short stature and reach and allowed him to attack from all sides of an opponent almost simultaneously. This combat would be spectacular, but it is unlikely Luke would win. It is far more probable that Yoda would win, or force a draw. I return this debate to my opponent.",1,Chrysippus,"

680,"= Framework = Burden of proof Contrary to what my opponent has claimed, I do not hold the burden of proof. The resolution is ""not all property is capital"", meaning pro is making the claim. Criteria for capital As stated before, capital is anything that can be considered a form of wealth, or be used to obtain wealth. There are two ways in which something can be considered capital; if it is financial capital, or if it is working capital. (n) capital (wealth in the form of money or property owned by a person or business and human resources of economic value) (n) working capital (assets available for use in the production of further assets) (1) = Arguments = Intellectual Property- a. Art Art is capital, and the Mickey Mouse cartoon is capital. Mickey Mouse can be used to generate revenue. The character can be used to sell a product, such as a T-shirt, or bubble gum. The character can be used to sell the Disney brand, and therefore is an asset of Disney, used to generate a profit. Intellectual property is protected by copyright laws, because it can be used to generate a profit. The reason why someone spends money to patent their intellectual property, is because intellectual property, and patents are both capital; intellectual property can be used to generate a profit, and patents can be used so that others cannot compete using your idea, without paying you a fee. Music is art. Take for example the song ""Happy Birthday to you"" which was believed in the 80's to generate an annual-revenue of $1 million, from royalties. If a movie or TV uses the Birthday song, they must pay Warner Communications, who purchased the rights to the song from the Birch Tree Group in 1988. (2) b. Music Until someone sells the rights to their music they will continue generating a profit from the song; this makes the rights to the song an asset, and therefore capital. Because one generates a profit from the song, the song is capital. If someone sells the rights to the song they also make a profit, therefore the rights are also capital. People pay money in order to have a right to a copy of the song, but not to use the song as their own. If someone pirates a song, they are stealing capital from the artist, because they stealing a copy of the song without payment. The song is an asset to the artist. If someone purchases the right to a copy of the artist's song, such as a CD, they could then resell that right/CD to someone else, if they no longer wish to listen to the song. This makes each copy of the song a form of capital. 2. Sufficiency- a. Currency is not a sufficient standard- Pro claims because he cannot copy and resell a CD he has purchased, he did not purchase capital. As I have already pointed out, when purchasing a CD one is not purchasing the rights to copy and distribute the song, but rather the rights to a single copy of the song, for one's enjoyment. If one no longer wishes to listen to the song, they may simply resell the CD, or right to the copy. Illegal downloads are theft of capital, because one is illegally obtaining a copy without compensation. b. Advocacy My opponent claims that not all property can be traded; however an artist can sell the rights to his artwork. As I already mentioned, the rights to the song ""Happy Birthday to you"" has switched hands, from the Birch Tree Group to Warner Communications; if intellectual property could not be traded, than this would be impossible. Again Capital is not just something which can be bought or sold; it is also something which can be used to generate a profit. Take for example Spreadshirt GmbH; if someone uploads a design they created onto their website and other people create a shirt with that design, than the artist who created the design gains a commission. The design helps the artist gain a profit, and thus is capital. (3) If someone writes and article, than sells it on a constant-content.com, they could sell full rights to the article, unique rights, or simply usage rights. If someone purchases usage rights, they may only use a copy of the article once, and cannot resell the article. If they purchase unique rights they may use the article, and no one else would be able to purchase and the article again, but the customer may not resell the article. If someone buys full rights to the article, than not only do they have sole rights to use the unique article, but they may also resell the article. (4) Full rights are worth more than unique rights, and unique rights are worth more than usage rights. Each right is a form of capital, and is intellectual property. 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>...",1,DanT,"

Because one generates a profit from the song, the song is capital. If someone sells the rights to the song they also make a profit, therefore the rights are also capital.  
  People pay money in order to have a right to a copy of the song, but not to use the song as their own. If someone pirates a song, they are stealing capital from the artist, because they stealing a copy of the song without payment. The song is an asset to the artist. If someone purchases the right to a copy of the artist’s song, such as a CD, they could then resell that right/CD to someone else, if they no longer wish to listen to the song. This makes each copy of the song a form of capital.  
     
     2. Sufficiency-  
  a.   Currency is not a sufficient standard-  
  Pro claims because he cannot copy and resell a CD he has purchased, he did not purchase capital. As I have already pointed out, when purchasing a CD one is not purchasing the rights to copy and distribute the song, but rather the rights to a single copy of the song, for one’s enjoyment. If one no longer wishes to listen to the song, they may simply resell the CD, or right to the copy. Illegal downloads are theft of capital, because one is illegally obtaining a copy without compensation.  
  b. Advocacy  
  My opponent claims that not all property can be traded; however an artist can sell the rights to his artwork. As I already mentioned, the rights to the song “Happy Birthday to you” has switched hands, from the Birch Tree Group to Warner Communications; if intellectual property could not be traded, than this would be impossible.  
  Again Capital is not just something which can be bought or sold; it is also something which can be used to generate a profit. Take for example Spreadshirt GmbH; if someone uploads a design they created onto their website and other people create a shirt with that design, than the artist who created the design gains a commission. The design helps the artist gain a profit, and thus is capital. (3) If someone writes and article, than sells it on a constant-content.com, they could sell full rights to the article, unique rights, or simply usage rights. If someone purchases usage rights, they may only use a copy of the article once, and cannot resell the article. If they purchase unique rights they may use the article, and no one else would be able to purchase and the article again, but the customer may not resell the article. If someone buys full rights to the article, than not only do they have sole rights to use the unique article, but they may also resell the article. (4) Full rights are worth more than unique rights, and unique rights are worth more than usage rights. Each right is a form of capital, and is intellectual property.

683,"I thank my opponent for his interesting arguments. My opponent first states that the idea of comparative advantage does not really work in an environment of varying labor standards and unfair labor practices. His first impact states that unfair policies in China and other nations will undermine the competitiveness of small businesses in the US. However, his economic analysis here does not hold up. He ignores one crucially important fact: when another country sells the US cheap goods, American consumers benefit enormously. The Congressional Research Service reported in January of 2007 that, ""...low-cost imports [from China especially] have increased overall consumer welfare, enabling consumers to purchase other goods and services (and hence stimulating growth in other sectors of the economy)"" [1]. Thus, as consumers are able to do more and more with their money, our economy only grows larger and larger, and the small businesses my opponent is worried about will benefit. My opponent's second impact is that because of free trade, a gradual shift will occur in our societal values until we are as unjust with regard to labor policies as China. However, the tariffs he proposes will only exacerbate this potential problem. Let's look at it this way: when we trade with China (or any foreign nation, for that matter), both economies prosper. Why would American citizens continue to purchase foreign goods if it did not benefit them? If we restrict this trade, we will only hinder economic growth for both nations. If China's economy begins to lag behind, it's logical response would be to increase the use of unfair labor practices such as child labor; in the words of my opponent, China would be striving to become more efficient. On the other hand, by allowing free trade with China, we can encourage economic development in China. With growing prosperity in their country, Chinese businesses would no longer be forced to commit unfair practices and Chinese leaders would be able to ban unfair labor practices without fear of economic downturn. Basically, if we allow China to grow economically, we will see a reduction in unfair policies. This is true of any developing nation. Furthermore, China specifically is already working to improve labor conditions. In a speech at the Albert Shanker Institute in January of 2008, Li Qiang stated that, ""...the Chinese government is attempting to improve workers conditions..."" [2]. This is because of free trade with the US and other countries, not in spite of it. A protectionist stance now would only serve to reverse this positive trend. We can also look to past experience to see that tariffs are never an effective solution. For an example, let's look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This protectionist legislation was intended to free the US from the grip of the Great Depression, but, as Paul Blustein of the Brookings Institution noted in December of 2008, the act ""...is justifiably notorious for having triggered a disastrous cycle of trade conflict"" [3]. When the US imposed restrictions on the ability of other nations to sell their products to Americans, the global community retaliated by imposing similar restrictions on US products. This trade war was detrimental to the US and other countries. In the end, trade restrictions will only be counterproductive, and will never solve our trade problems. [1] <URL>... . [2] <URL>...

And that therefore, there is no need to worry about the future since it cannot be changed. I would like to disagree. Stating that future does not exist is wrong. Scientists have actually predicted and made theories on how to travel into future. Einstein, in his theories of relativity, postulated that the measured time interval between two events, would depend on how fast the observer would be moving. This hypothesis has been proved by various methods. Tests have shown that travel by plane, increases a second by a few nanoseconds. In the laboratory, subatomic particles called muons, have been propelled at light speed in atomic generators, and have shown that their rate of decay slows dramatically in respect to their higher velocities. The author cites that cosmic rays, from outer space, can reach us on earth, because the resulting speed of these rays reduces their rate of decay, allowing them to reach us and be seen by us. Dramatic time warps start occurring near the speed of light. Mr. Davies gives an example of this phenomenon, by stating that if twins are born at the same time, and one travels at the speed of light for a year before returning to earth, the traveling twin would be one year old, while the earthbound twin could have aged 10 earth years. By traveling fast, namely the speed of light, time will slow down for us, while continuing at a normal pace elsewhere. Theoretically, calculations could be made to jump to a specific time and point in the future. It is also known that gravity slows down time as well. We know that time goes by faster in space than here on earth, because we are closer to the earth and the earth's gravitational pull. Subsequently, time in a submarine goes by even slower than those on land, for the same reason. Scientists have calculated that a neutron stars' gravitational pull is so strong, that it slows time down by thirty percent. Scientists feel that if an astronaut could zoom very close to a neutron star or black hole for that matter, he could leap far into the future. If a person can leap from present to future, then it means that Future does exist, right? This argument is purely scientific and proven experimentally.

Theoretically, calculations could be made to jump to a specific time and point in the future. It is also known that gravity slows down time as well. We know that time goes by faster in space than here on earth, because we are closer to the earth and the earth's gravitational pull. Subsequently, time in a submarine goes by even slower than those on land, for the same reason. Scientists have calculated that a neutron stars' gravitational pull is so strong, that it slows time down by thirty percent. Scientists feel that if an astronaut could zoom very close to a neutron star or black hole for that matter, he could leap far into the future.  
  
If a person can leap from present to future, then it means that Future does exist, right? This argument is purely scientific and proven experimentally.

689,"As he is a veteran of Ultimate Team Wars, I take Mongeese's comment on the trickiness of this battle as a big compliment! CHARACER VALIDITY Pro concedes Graviton's ability to fly but questions their existence. However, his critisms are not new to the scientific community and neither disprove gravitons nor explain away scientific evidence to the contrary [1][2]. As my opponent and I are unlikely to settle a scientific dispute in this venue, I will leave it to the voters to determine whether the evidence favors one side or the other. As for Super Skrull, he can shapeshift his body into organic or inorganic objects of his choice that are not overly large or small [3]. Here, he can easily transform into flying beasts and turn body parts into weapons at will. Skrull will have his additional abilities, though, as Pro's attack on his equipment misses the mark. The power amplifying signal was created for and used exclusively by Super Skrull during battle [5], which meets the criteria for equipment laid out by Rule 7. Nowhere in the source material is it stated that other beings are needed to continuously maintain or operate the beam, nor do the rules dictate that equipment must be present within the battle arena. COUNTER-ATTACK My opponent starts by questioning Spot's ability to generate portals instantaneously. To start, Spot can indeed shoot his portals quickly and over vast distances [6]. In addition, he can easily make them appear in locations of his choosing. My original reference specifies that Spot can ""create new spots,"" ""control and manipulate the warps to almost any degree he wishes,"" and ""surround his opponents with numerous spots, allowing him to punch or kick them from unexpected angles across great distances. [7]"" This is seen in Spot's battles, where portals appear directly around his enemies [8] or throughout new areas without having been thrown [9]. The videos also clearly show his ability to generate [Video 1 - 0:00-0:02, 3:57-4:43][Video 2 - 1:00-1:06] and shoot [Video 2 - 1:50-2:10] portals. Pro goes on to question Spot's ability to remain airborne. I was well aware of this shortcoming and chose supporting characters that could support him at a moment's notice; Peter can use telekinesis to levitate him, Super Skrull and Magneto can encase him in floating force fields, and Graviton can grant him flight through gravity manipulation. Lastly, Pro argues that Mewtwo's barriers can stop the portals. As I evidenced earlier, Spot's warp tunnels appear instantaneously and anywhere of his choosing. He will not be throwing portals against Mewtwo's barrier, but rather conjuring them a millimeter away from his body in every direction. Even if Mewtwo somehow manages to create his shield, such inter-dimensional can appear anywhere, including behind psychic forcefields. As for Mewtwo's teleportation and mind-wiping abilities, I am still unconvinced of their existence. Pro's source references pokemon and trainers traveling to other locations and losing memories of recent events, but makes no mention of how these creatures traveled or how long such memory wipes took to complete. Keep in mind, though, that Mewtwo and his team will be long defeated before he has the opportunity to use any of these potential tricks. With Pro's arguments defeated, my plans will come to fruition. All five members of the opposing team begin moving at battle's start, instantly touching Spot's portals and disqualifying themselves. Magneto will encompass my team with protective force fields capable of withstanding nuclear blasts [10], which will also levitate Spot. Magneto is then free to hurl the metal-clad Link toward a portal and attack remaining enemies with a mix of magnetically enhanced strength and speed. Peter uses his telekinetic abilities to force any remaining opponents into a nearby portal or levitate Spot, if need be. He also has the capacity to slow time for non-teammates during this time [11], ensuring that all spots are placed with no interference. If fully powered, Graviton and Super Skrull will force enemies toward portals and attack freely. If not, they will serve as distractions to remaining enemies with flight and hypnosis [11].

696,"""This isn't true. Pirates have treasure only if they can procure it from battleships. Ships that may take months to find, and even then they must go to port and find them, whereas Ninjas can procure money anytime they want, they simply must scale a wall or two and reap the rewards."" My opponent would have you believe that stealing treasure form a castle is easier than stealing it from an enemy ship. This is not true, it simply takes different approaches. Furthermore, a ninja cannot carry as much as a pirate because the ninja lacks a place to put the treasure. The pirate can just place a treasure chest on his ship. Ninjas have to carry it miles away to their camp. this is terribly inefficient. ""Let's assume that by ships we're saying they have superior modes of transportation, especially because of the weapons (cannons and stuff). However, Ninjas rely on their own two feet. This shows great strength, because a ship requires materials and can only run on water, feet can run anywhere on land and can be used to swim in water. As to the guns, Ninjas can easily attach shurikens to their feet in order to execute flying kicks to eliminate foes. That's way better than cannons."" This isn't about transportation, it's about having an awesome ship. Even if you had a better means of transportation, you'd still want a pirate ship, just like you still want an X-Wing. ""The reliability of a gun comes into question. A ninja can throw a shuriken from 50 feet accurately, whereas a pirate flintlock has horrible accuracy. Furthermore, the reload time on a gun is much more than a shuriken.

When debating weapons, we have to look as to who would win in a fight. Now, a pirate can obviously survive a shuriken blow, because he's a pirate and he's a beast.

""This isn't true. Pirates have treasure only if they can procure it from battleships. Ships that may take months to find, and even then they must go to port and find them, whereas Ninjas can procure money anytime they want, they simply must scale a wall or two and reap the rewards.""  
  
My opponent would have you believe that stealing treasure form a castle is easier than stealing it from an enemy ship. This is not true, it simply takes different approaches. Furthermore, a ninja cannot carry as much as a pirate because the ninja lacks a place to put the treasure. The pirate can just place a treasure chest on his ship. Ninjas have to carry it miles away to their camp. this is terribly inefficient.  
  
""Let's assume that by ships we're saying they have superior modes of transportation, especially because of the weapons (cannons and stuff). However, Ninjas rely on their own two feet. This shows great strength, because a ship requires materials and can only run on water, feet can run anywhere on land and can be used to swim in water. As to the guns, Ninjas can easily attach shurikens to their feet in order to execute flying kicks to eliminate foes. That's way better than cannons.""  
  
This isn't about transportation, it's about having an awesome ship. Even if you had a better means of transportation, you'd still want a pirate ship, just like you still want an X-Wing.  
  
""The reliability of a gun comes into question. A ninja can throw a shuriken from 50 feet accurately, whereas a pirate flintlock has horrible accuracy. Furthermore, the reload time on a gun is much more than a shuriken. You see that shurikens can be thrown one after another accurately for 100 yards, whereas a flintlock takes about 30 seconds to reload and is inaccurate after 50 yards or so.""

I am slightly unhappy with this as unless CON was given no prior warning of his final, he should have been able to work out that rounds 4 and 5 will be during his exams and therefore should have not accepted the challenge. On the question of my sources, let me say that while my opponent has relied solely on news paper articles; I have used evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals for the my main points (the adoption studies and most of the IQ figures) and used news paper articles for things such as SAT scores which are less controversial and did not, in my opinion, need much proving. The youtube video of Professor J. Philippe Rushton was merely for readers who wished to have a more in depth look at the subject and I did not quote anything from it other than that there were many papers showing that there was an IQ difference (I quoted once such paper in the next round and also copied a table from it) To reiterate my arguments: there have been numerous studies confirming that there is an IQ/intelligence hierarchy and this fact is generally accepted in the scientific community. However, what scientific researchers do not agree on is whether this IQ difference is 100% environment or if it has a genetic factor to it as well. (Please remember that all I have to do is to prove that there is a 1% genetic factor and i'll have proven that some races are at a - inherent - intellectual advantage.) To prove that this IQ gap is not entirely down to environment I have quoted many trans-racial adoption studies involving blacks and mongloids. These have shown that even when adopted into white families the mongoloids still score higher than average on the IQ test (around 108); my opponent, at this point, said that the adopting families are obviously well-off if they can afford to adopt and and that wealth is negatively correlated to racism so these Korean children will have an environmental advantage. I responded that if this were the case then black children who were adopted by white parents must have even bigger of an environmental advantage since there is a longer history of racism towards blacks so they should score at least as well as the Koreans - however they do not, and what is more they actually score BELOW the national average (around 87) showing that environment cannot account for everything.

Why shouldn't we raise it to 18 to reduce even more deaths? The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, which consider consequences, does not fully mature until at the age of 25. The reason that the driving age isn't 25 is that driving is necessary to go to college at the age of 18. The age of majority indicates the end of adolescence and people who reach this age are regarded as adults and are held to be responsible for their actions. Therefore 18 is better than 16, because people who are 18 are regarded as adults and have more experience than 16-year-olds with a more developed dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. I have never proposed a strict system in which one can only get a license at age 18. By raising the driving age to 18, I meant by learners will still be granted their provisional license from 16 or 17, but will need a year to pass a beefed-up test, which means the minimum age at which a new driver could realistically go out on his or her own will be 18. The people under the age of 18 will have to be supervised by an adult such as a legal guardian or parent.

Anyone can show maturity at any age, but it takes more than 1/2 of the people with large amounts of maturity to lower or keep the driving age. ""Risk statistics based on age seems overall a rather lousy way to give a basis for qualification for things that very widely based on individual.""

Less cars on the road, less air pollution, might slow down global warming. May not stop global warming, but it will help. ""Heavy drinking is encouraged and in which peer pressure is on to also encourage faster driving then we are more likely to have individuals conditioned to drive poorly."" That is exactly the reason why we need to raise the driving age to 18, because adults are more mature and can deal with peer pressure better than teenagers age 16 or under.

I didn't intend the global warming argument to be a contention, because it is ultimately not a reason to deny individuals who could handle driving a car the ability to do so. However, you would notice that we don't have the most fuel efficient cars invented yet and cars that are the most fuel efficient are not relatively cheap. Less cars on the road, less air pollution, might slow down global warming. May not stop global warming, but it will help.  
  
""Heavy drinking is encouraged and in which peer pressure is on to also encourage faster driving then we are more likely to have individuals conditioned to drive poorly.""  
  
That is exactly the reason why we need to raise the driving age to 18, because adults are more mature and can deal with peer pressure better than teenagers age 16 or under. That's also why teens often seem more impetuous than adults. In making decisions, they rely more on the parts of their brain that control emotion.

715,"Firstly, many thanks for an interesting debate and providing some excellent counter-arguments. You cite a drop in turn-out in Australia once AV was introduced after the last FPTP election in 1917. Well let me say this 1) The 1917 election under FPTP was a war-time election. Issues such as conscription, an war related economic chaos were on the cards. 1917 was always going to see a huge turn-out. The following AV elections were not during a time of war. 2) You will actually find that the drop in turn-out was across the board. This included constituencies where there were only two candidates running and therefore despite it officially being AV, as they had only two candidates to choose between, was basically a FPTP election in some areas. But the reduction in turnout was same. <URL>... I therefore fully contest your claims that AV would induce reduced turn-out. In fact, I think it would make people who are currently apathetic more inclined to vote - many people do not see how their vote can make a difference and rightly so given that UK elections are decided in only a handful of constituencies. The Maltese system being unique You highlight here something which is very true. The Maltese system is very different, but only as different as the <PHONE> elections you have cited as prooving AV to reduce voter turn-out. We must therefore agree that both comparisons do nothing to proove effects on voter turn-out in the UK. Under coalition governments parties with even smaller voter support have a disproportionately large amount of political power The thing that undermines your argument here, is that you are attacking the AV system by labelling it as producing basically what you are describing as a minority government, or one that is formed from minority pressure. The truth of the matter is, that under First Past the Post the minority can not only be the 'kingmaker', but the winners of the election outright themselves! You can easily have a party in sole power with only 30% support. With 7/10 of ten people against them, how can this possibly be defended as being the democratic solution? You have a fear of coalitions, but you must realise that coalitions are the norm in so many countries - so many successful countries, and smaller parties always have bargaining power. That is the nature of a coalition. This bargaining power does not render coalitions undemocratic, but merely makes the main party take other considerations on board, so the resulting government represents a broader range of the public spectrum. Your fears of coalitions are simply unfounded, given that they have been proven to work in so many other countries. You also again refer to the 2nd preferences of people that voted for 'extremist parties'. Firstly for a candidate to win, just with added 2nd preferences from extremist voters, they would most likely have to be very very near the 50% mark already. Secondly, everyones vote is equal - people who vote for extremist parties should be counted just as much as the next person. If you think that somehow their vote counts more, then you have misunderstood the basis of AV. People might be more likely to vote for an extremist party since their vte will not be wasted under AV If people want to vote for extremist parties, that is there democratic right and choice. Who are we to tell them who to vote for? This is much the same argument used against PR - that it would allow the BNP into parliament. Well so what? If thats what people have voted for, then they should be represented. We should provide political arguments against them this way rather than simply resorting to excluding them through making our whole system undemocratic. AV & Complication Here, my opponent spouts nonsense about 'tactical voting' under AV. There is no way you can ensure an opposing party comes last on the first count, so this argument is a complete untruth. If you've voted for a party that has a chance to go on and win, then your second preference will never be counted. So its near impossible to vote tactically. Just to re-iterate, if your first choice goes on to win - then your second choice will never be counted. And if your first choice is eliminated, then they've already lost out anyway! SUMMARY Alternative Vote produces candidates who receive over 50% preferential support from the population. Thats to say more people would like this candidate over any other candidate. That is democracy. Democracy is not minority rule, as under First Past the Post - where a candidate can be kept in power by a minority of the electorate (say 30% for example). While Alternative Vote is not a perfect voting system, and my opponent has raised some good arguments, it is fundamentally more fair than First Past the Post. It is not expensive, it is not complicated and there is little to no viable proof that it will reduce voter turn-out. If you have an irrational fear of coalition then you may have a valid personal problem with Alternative Vote. But given that in many (if not post) European countries (whose political systems are most similar to ours) coalitions are common if not the norm, this is simply unfounded. Politicians understandably do not like it, as it makes things harder for them. But this is a good thing and increased scrutiny and negotiatiation can only strengthen our democracy. Much of the anti-AV argument is based on these kind of irrational fears. I would like to concude that whatever your fears of coalition, and issues with AV complexity, the defense of First Past the Post as a democratic system is near impossible. Minority rule cannot be defended in 2011. FPTP is an archaic and old system that would best be left in the past. Many thanks for a great debate.",1,andyh,"

717,"Well first out yet again you are mostly correct but if you read everything I put down you would have known that I said Hitler should have kept the British at bay by continuously bombing them, and as a side note you would know the bulk of the German attack force used during the battle of Brittan were bombers which as we know with the US bombing runs bombers were easy to take down and the bombers Germany used the Stuka, Junkers 88, Heinkel 111, Dornier 17, and Dornier 215 those were the bombers used with only the BF-109 and Messerschmitt 110 were the only fighters used; and as we know the b-17 was a very protected bomber and more protected and armed than any of the German bombers and as we see the B-17 was easily taken down now look at the German bombers easy to kill so all those losses were due to the massive amount of bombers used and the frail nature of them. That all said with regards to Africa look at this photo showing Africa and how it was controlled in 1940 <URL>... as you can see Egypt and Sudan main areas Brittan still had control over was surrounded by the axis and as I said before if Germany just kept Brittan busy with bombings and concentrated the bulk of their forces into the Afrika Corps (yes its actually spelled Afrika) lead by Rommel Africa would have fallen easily you have to reamer Hitler barley supplied Rommel and his Afrika Corps which is why Montgomery seemed so powerful he was fighting an under supplied force with limited resources now it Hitler sent supplies to the Afrika Corps would have easily taken over Africa then the middle east. After gathering enough supplies all Germany would have to do is toughen the blockade against Brittan then run and air raid and land invasion at the same time Brittan would only fall in a matter of time as the only reason Brittan was still standing was because they were still being supplied by America. And I hope you know with all the resources that Germany would get by taking the Middle East there economy would be the best in the world. While with Japan yes they were fighting a formidable foe but the thing that ended the Japanese takeover of China was the US launching the Pacific front while Japan had to supply troops to the Pacific and China at the same time stretching their military thinly and due to the Burma road at that point it became inevitable that Japan lost the war but like I said if Japan never launched the attack on Pearl Harbor as I said all Japan would have to do is focus on China and if need be call Germany for help attacking on the west and Japan on the east as the USSR wouldn""t be an issue as Germany would have never attacked and with China taken Japan would have all the resources needed and could get oil from German held middle east and Japan would ship over needed metals to Germany to keep the war machine rolling. And you also bring up Lend lease in which America and Brittan supply the USSR with weapons well that all started in March 11, 1941 after the Soviets declared war on Germany due to German invasion, but as I""m proposing Germany would have never invaded which would lead to lend lease never happening. And as for Australia there would be nothing Brittan could do Blockades would stop aid going to Australia and Brittan would be occupied with its issues with the Germans than helping one of its colonies half way around the world. And while yes you are true Americans don""t take to kindly to being subjugated but if you look in our history you will see the Nazi party had already had placed some roots in the US and with a standing army of only 300,000 the US would be overwhelmed and would lose ground fast as the onslaught form both coasts would cripple the nation.

Well first out yet again you are mostly correct but if you read everything I put down you would have known that I said Hitler should have kept the British at bay by continuously bombing them, and as a side note you would know the bulk of the German attack force used during the battle of Brittan were bombers which as we know with the US bombing runs bombers were easy to take down and the bombers Germany used the Stuka, Junkers 88, Heinkel 111, Dornier 17, and Dornier 215 those were the bombers used with only the BF-109 and Messerschmitt 110 were the only fighters used; and as we know the b-17 was a very protected bomber and more protected and armed than any of the German bombers and as we see the B-17 was easily taken down now look at the German bombers easy to kill so all those losses were due to the massive amount of bombers used and the frail nature of them. That all said with regards to Africa look at this photo showing Africa and how it was controlled in 1940   http://en.wikipedia.org...   as you can see Egypt and Sudan main areas Brittan still had control over was surrounded by the axis and as I said before if Germany just kept Brittan busy with bombings and concentrated the bulk of their forces into the Afrika Corps (yes its actually spelled Afrika) lead by Rommel Africa would have fallen easily you have to reamer Hitler barley supplied Rommel and his Afrika Corps which is why Montgomery seemed so powerful he was fighting an under supplied force with limited resources now it Hitler sent supplies to the Afrika Corps would have easily taken over Africa then the middle east. After gathering enough supplies all Germany would have to do is toughen the blockade against Brittan then run and air raid and land invasion at the same time Brittan would only fall in a matter of time as the only reason Brittan was still standing was because they were still being supplied by America. And I hope you know with all the resources that Germany would get by taking the Middle East there economy would be the best in the world. While with Japan yes they were fighting a formidable foe but the thing that ended the Japanese takeover of China was the US launching the Pacific front while Japan had to supply troops to the Pacific and China at the same time stretching their military thinly and due to the Burma road at that point it became inevitable that Japan lost the war but like I said if Japan never launched the attack on Pearl Harbor as I said all Japan would have to do is focus on China and if need be call Germany for help attacking on the west and Japan on the east as the USSR wouldn""t be an issue as Germany would have never attacked and with China taken Japan would have all the resources needed and could get oil from German held middle east and Japan would ship over needed metals to Germany to keep the war machine rolling. And you also bring up Lend lease in which America and Brittan supply the USSR with weapons well that all started in March 11, 1941 after the Soviets declared war on Germany due to German invasion, but as I""m proposing Germany would have never invaded which would lead to lend lease never happening. And as for Australia there would be nothing Brittan could do Blockades would stop aid going to Australia and Brittan would be occupied with its issues with the Germans than helping one of its colonies half way around the world. And while yes you are true Americans don""t take to kindly to being subjugated but if you look in our history you will see the Nazi party had already had placed some roots in the US and with a standing army of only 300,000 the US would be overwhelmed and would lose ground fast as the onslaught form both coasts would cripple the nation. And yes while we know now that Germany, Italy, and Japan could never win due to economic restraints when you look at the scenario I bring up both economies would boom and grow huge with the Nazis controlling the oil fields and the Japanese controlling the Philippian oil fields and Chinese vast mineral reserves.

I've already defined amnesty and I feel that 'illegal immigrant' is a pretty commonly defined and well-known term, so let's get started. Key reasons why illegal immigrants shouldn't be provided amnesty in the United States : 1. Government benefits. In the United States, there are government-provided, taxpayer-funded services that illegal immigrants are welcome to acquire. Such services are not limited to welfare, education, and food stamps, which are meant for U.S. citizens .

This needs to be outlawed and they should not be allowed to enroll for these benefits that are for U.S. citizens, not undocumented illegals. 2. They take our jobs away Because of cheap labor demands by companies who want to save a buck, they take advantage of and exploit illegal workers instead of hiring a great amount unemployed legal citizens [2].

[3] They can even get tax returns and scam us by doing so![4] By being here illegally and taking away jobs and getting tax returns, they are taking away money to give back to their home country instead of contributing to our economy. They should not be allowed to do so. 3. They contribute to our drug war Aside from the safety concerns we face from violent drug cartels and smugglers who transport drugs to the States since we don't regulate narcotics, they also contribute to the clogging up of drug-related offenders in prison, even the prison system is corrupted as well because they choose to house these criminals, not deport them.

In the same episode, she only cares that she saves himself even if that means leaving her behind, trapped and completely helpless against uber timberwolf. Applebuck Season: Applejack, early on in the episode, saves Ponyville from a raging stampede. And they speak of this event as if it happens all the time. Applejack puts her life on the line in stampedes in order to save the town... all the time. The Last Roundup: Applejack wants town hall to be repaired. For this to happen, she goes to a rodeo with hopes of winning so the prize money can go toward fixing it. When she doesn't win, instead of returning home, she takes up a job on a cherry farm in order to earn the money needed. 2.

Consequently, they lose and have to leave town. But, the Flim Flam brothers quickly go out of business because their cider sucks. The following is from the first letter Applejack had to write to Princess Celestia: ""Dear Princess Celestia, I wanted to share my thoughts with you. *Ahem*. I didn't learn anything! I was right the whole time!"" ... thus becoming the first and only pony to have been right the whole time. 3. Super Strangth (spelled wrong for emphasis) Fall Weather Friends: Rainbow Dash, the most athletic flier in Equestria, hits the bell on the strength test game. Applejack, breaks the flipping bell. For the most part of the original competition, she is ahead of Rainbow Dash. Until Rainbow cheats and starts using her wings.

727,"Only a couple of points because I'm sick of losing sleep over this: I. My behavior with Mason lead him on to think it was acceptable. We cuddled, drank wine, etc. I quite obviously lead him on. But, I do agree with my opponent. His behavior was unacceptable. What he did was wrong. I agree. And yes, I would want him to apologize to Jenny if: A. I hadn't found out a week later that Jenny had cheated on me 3 times during the course of our relationship (1 week after this Mason incident she broke up with me). Thus, I lost all respect for Jenny and didn't make Mason apologize to her. B. Jenny knows about the incident and doesn't care, because, well, she didn't care about me at the time she found out. Nor does she probably care right now. I, Danielle's current girlfriend, however, care very much about the Sadie incident. II. I am appalled that my opponent would call me a cheater. I dd not make a single physical move toward anyone during my relationship with Jenny. I may have fallen in love with Emily, but I did not ever cheat on Jenny with Emily. III. My opponent has never brought up this issue she has with Mason with me until this very debate. If she would have discussed this outside of DDO, I may have taken her more seriously. Every time I asked her outside of this debate if she has a problem with Mason, or if he doesn't like me talking to him, she has said that she doesn't have a problem with him doesn't mind me talking to him. I have been quite vocal about her not talking to Sadie. IV. Danielle's best friend has never made a move to get to know me on a one to one basis as well. I don't hold this against her, though. Mason and I were estranged for a couple of months because, well, I lost contact with everyone in my life for quite a while when I went to New Jersey to be with Danielle for months upon months. I don't have much contact with any of my friends anymore (Danielle can attest to this) as the zero contact lead them to resent me. Mason and I have started talking again since winter break on a normal level. I've been promising him for about 2 years that I would go visit him again (as he has come here plenty of times and we have hung out). So, this trip has been in the planning for a long, long time. V. I also don't admire the guilt trip my more than willing girlfriend has offered me about her family and friends. I've gone with her to New York every chance I can manage (which is quite a few times, at least once every other month - sometimes more- and I'm a full time student). I've also, on every single occasion, driven Danielle 16 hours there and back. I am very committed to her seeing her family and friends, and obviously work hard to get her there. I am very appalled that she would give me a guilt trip because I wanted to visit one of my only friends - that I, for the first time in our relationship, wanted to take a trip to see *MY* friend. I never said she couldn't go to New York (as I am obviously letting her go). I offered to work over time to have her come with me to North Carolina to see Mason, and also have the ability to go see her family and friends in New York. VI. I, Danielle's current girlfriend, think that Sadie should offer me an apology. My opponent would love for you to believe that Sadie was on higher moral ground to do it in ""front of me."" But I believe this is by far more disrespectful. A. She didn't kiss Danielle in *front* of me. She tried to make out with her in the bathroom where I couldn't see them. Cowardly. B. The two attempted make out sessions were more than ""minutes"" apart. At the least, they were 15 minutes a part, and we were sitting far away from the bathroom. Both times Sadie got up and followed Danielle to the bathroom and attempted to do this. C. Danielle says that I could have told Sadie off at the bar. But, I hope that Danielle realizes that was there with a fake ID (I could have gotten in lots of trouble), and Danielle had begged me not to do anything. I was respecting her wishes. VII. And for my last point: I asked Danielle over and over if it was ok for me to go visit my friend in North Carolina. She said it was. If my girlfriend raises an issue, or says she is uncomfortable with me either talking to or visiting Mason, I would gladly respect her wishes and not go visit him in North Carolina. She hasn't brought this up to me at all. Mason, however, has never disrespected Danielle. He disrespected Jenny, whom doesn't care for an apology. Sadie disrespected *me*, Danielle's current girlfriend. And I care very much about the incident. And, as a side note, I know if this had happened between Sadie and Amelia, Danielle would have made Sadie apologize right there at the bar ;) If Sadie offers me an apology, I don't mind if Danielle and Sadie talk.

However, if that child was using that laptop in a school then it would automatically become the teacher's responsibility as the parent isn't at the school. Young children need to be monitored on a computer due to the harmful things out there such as cyber bullying. Secondly, a teacher monitoring a computer is not a matter of ""betraying trust"". It would be an illegal move on the teacher's part to do it after hours. As I said in the last round it just wouldn't be worth the risks of losing their career.

731,"Well MYTN, we agreed on something! Debate IS tiring but you have to admit that it's more educational and mind expanding than sitting around watching Discovery channel all the time. It's like exercising your brain muscle once in a while. Thanks for hanging in there. We've been through the pros and cons now so let me sew it up. What we were debating about was you assertion that ""There is a low enough probability for the existence of God to doubt his existence."" I obviously disagree and am at the far opposite end of your scale. I believe that science has done an amazing job showing that there is a low enough probability that all this just happened by chance that we MUST attribute the universe and everything in it to a very real God. If God chose to, he could have created this universe and all life in it without any possibility of ever discovering anything about how it works. By that I mean that if he didn't want to be detectable through his creation he certainly could have made it so. I find it fascinating that not only did he leave his work open for investigation he also endowed us with the ability, even the drive, to discover him through his works. I also find it fascinating that he designed this place so well that no one can doubt his hand in creation while at the very same time he has made it impossible to both prove or disprove his existence. God allows us to approach and appreciate his work through science but he made sure that we cannot come into his presence without that one final step called ""faith"". Probability? Science is finding that all of ""this"" at the quantum level is nothing BUT probability. In the early days scientists found out through direct experimentation what they didn't know. These days, the bar is pushed out so far that scientists are faced with the impassible fence of the quantum level on one side and the impassible portal of the ""Big Bang"" singularity on the other. Not only do the laws of nature break down at these two ends of the universe so too does the scientific method. There are still many things to discover within these boundaries and discover them they will slowly, bit by bit. With each new discovery more questions and with each new question more discoveries; but science will never be able to prove nor disprove that God exists. I've listened to many debates and read several books on the contemporary arguments on both sides. It is incredible just how much science does know and yet discoveries always beget questions. Science (and Theists) always have and always will fall just short of proving or disproving God's existence. It simply can't be done because God designed it that way. I think that it would be very appropriate to ask God to end this debate in his own words spoken through the Apostle Paul in the Christian bible: Romans 1:20-22 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities-his eternal power and divine nature-have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools.",1,3DCrew,"
  
Well MYTN, we agreed on something! Debate IS tiring but you have to admit that it's more educational and mind expanding than sitting around watching Discovery channel all the time. It's like exercising your brain muscle once in a while. Thanks for hanging in there.  
  
We've been through the pros and cons now so let me sew it up. What we were debating about was you assertion that ""There is a low enough probability for the existence of God to doubt his existence."" I obviously disagree and am at the far opposite end of your scale. I believe that science has done an amazing job showing that there is a low enough probability that all this just happened by chance that we MUST attribute the universe and everything in it to a very real God.  
  
If God chose to, he could have created this universe and all life in it without any possibility of ever discovering anything about how it works. By that I mean that if he didn't want to be detectable through his creation he certainly could have made it so. I find it fascinating that not only did he leave his work open for investigation he also endowed us with the ability, even the drive, to discover him through his works. I also find it fascinating that he designed this place so well that no one can doubt his hand in creation while at the very same time he has made it impossible to both prove or disprove his existence. God allows us to approach and appreciate his work through science but he made sure that we cannot come into his presence without that one final step called ""faith"".  
  
Probability? Science is finding that all of ""this"" at the quantum level is nothing BUT probability. In the early days scientists found out through direct experimentation what they didn't know. These days, the bar is pushed out so far that scientists are faced with the impassible fence of the quantum level on one side and the impassible portal of the ""Big Bang"" singularity on the other. Not only do the laws of nature break down at these two ends of the universe so too does the scientific method. There are still many things to discover within these boundaries and discover them they will slowly, bit by bit. With each new discovery more questions and with each new question more discoveries; but science will never be able to prove nor disprove that God exists.

Science (and Theists) always have and always will fall just short of proving or disproving God's existence. It simply can't be done because God designed it that way.  
  
I think that it would be very appropriate to ask God to end this debate in his own words spoken through the Apostle Paul in the Christian bible:  
  
Romans 1:20-22  
For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities–his eternal power and divine nature–have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.

He levels the claim that while Protestants decide when it is and when it isn't okay to kill another human being, Catholicism teaches that murder is ALWAYS immoral. As I stated in my previous round, this is simply not true, and moral absolutes like this are dangerous and wrong. Even murder, very arguably the worst thing you can do to someone, is sometimes justified. For instance, it is justified when your own life is in danger, or when the life of another person hangs in the balance. It may also be justified as a punishment for people who take the lives of innocent people, though this is arguable. Protestantism does not teach either specific viewpoint on the death penalty, but it does let people go through a rational though process and arrive at a conclusion from that, rather than just shoving a false ""absolute"" down people's throats. SECOND - Good works Yes, Catholicism preaches that good works get you into heaven. But how moral are good works when you're being threatened into doing them, threatened with eternal torment if ye do not comply? Once virtuous acts become simple acts of obeying an authority. While the additional good works Catholicism creates are positive, the means are negative and this entire point really comes out as a wash. THIRD - Individualism Individualism itself is a good thing, unless taken to extremes where greed and power wholly outweigh any thought for the welfare of the community. My opponent claims that Protestantism does take individualism to this level, but it does not. Protestantism still teaches charity to its members, and still encourages good works (though not at the edge of sword). Protestantism does NOT teach greed and self-worship as my opponent suggests, and it is not the religion's fault that many of its members prefer individualist economics rather than communal economics. Rather, it is likely that extreme individualists, at certain points in history (during the reformation, for example), were drawn to Protestantism. Protestantism didn't cause these people to become such extreme individualists; it is not the fault of the religion that these people exist.

738,"I would like to thank my opponent for this debate. ==Addiction== My opponent contends that food and water do not cause people to commit crimes. This is not the case. Man's addiction to food and water can cause him to commit theft and murder. Following my opponent's logic, the solution is to make food and water illegal. Unlike food and water, drugs are not necessary for the individual to survive, and the individual can quit such drugs without dying, so the criminal effect is much less. There are a few important things to note: -Making drugs illegal has not stopped their use. -The effect of making drugs illegal increases crime rate. Making drugs illegal increases the cost of drugs[1], which means that a poor man addicted to coke must pay more for it. The result is an increased desperation, leading to crime. -My opponent's source claiming that drugs make people violent is actually ironic. The violence is due to the Mexican government's crackdown on drugs. So, it is making drugs illegal that causes murder and drug violence, according to my opponent's source[2]. -Making drugs illegal increases the profits for drug dealers[1], encouraging the sale of drugs. ==My Opponent's Crime Proposal== I avoided the drinking and driving argument because there exists a high level of bias towards the issue. If my opponent wants to harp on this issue, then I will point out drunk driving facts. 2007: -503 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes, which was 40 percent of the 1,249 total crash fatalities.[3] -More than 49,600 DUI arrests were recorded by the Secretary of State's office.[3] -Fifty to 75 percent of drunk drivers whose licenses are suspended continue to drive.[4] -Between 2002 and 1997, the number of drunk driving trips INCREASED[5], in face of laws attempting to decrease them. -A first time drunk driving offender on average has driven drunk 87 times prior to being arrested[6]. From these statistics, we can conlcude two things: -The criminalization of drunk driving has not decreased or discouraged it. -Someone in a drunk driving crash has on average driven drunk 8700 times prior to causing death. And so, drunk driving laws do little to prevent death, contrary to popular belief, while doing much to ruin lives. But that's all besides the point. My opponent is advocating the criminalization of drugs, which I have shown to only make matters worse while punishing innocent civilians. My opponent's crime definition premise is invalid and impractical for the reasons stated last round. ==My Crime Definition Proposal== ""Following my opponents flawed logic, murder would be legal."" No, murder would not be legal for the same reason that rape would be illegal: it is coercion. It is a crime because it infringes on another's ability to govern their ability to govern their life and property. By making this illegal, government is protecting the individual's life and liberty. Seeing as that was my opponent's only objection to my proposal, it stands. ==Misc.== My opponent objects to drugs because they cause violence, but as I have shown, making them illegal only increases this violence. My opponent has only warranted his statement that drug use increases crime with a source about how a government drug crackdown killed 33 people, which only further proves my case. ==CONCLUSION== Not only do drug laws do more harm than good, they are an infringement of liberty and the coercive authority of government.

-The effect of making drugs illegal increases crime rate. Making drugs illegal increases the cost of drugs[1], which means that a poor man addicted to coke must pay more for it. The result is an increased desperation, leading to crime.  
  
-My opponent's source claiming that drugs make people violent is actually ironic. The violence is due to the Mexican government's crackdown on drugs. So, it is making drugs illegal that causes murder and drug violence, according to my opponent's source[2].  
  
-Making drugs illegal increases the profits for drug dealers[1], encouraging the sale of drugs.  
  
==My Opponent's Crime Proposal==  
I avoided the drinking and driving argument because there exists a high level of bias towards the issue. If my opponent wants to harp on this issue, then I will point out drunk driving facts.  
2007:  
-503 people were killed in alcohol-related crashes, which was 40 percent of the 1,249 total crash fatalities.[3]  
-More than 49,600 DUI arrests were recorded by the Secretary of State's office.[3]  
  
-Fifty to 75 percent of drunk drivers whose licenses are suspended continue to drive.[4]  
-Between 2002 and 1997, the number of drunk driving trips INCREASED[5], in face of laws attempting to decrease them.  
-A first time drunk driving offender on average has driven drunk 87 times prior to being arrested[6].  
  
From these statistics, we can conlcude two things:  
-The criminalization of drunk driving has not decreased or discouraged it.  
-Someone in a drunk driving crash has on average driven drunk 8700 times prior to causing death.  
And so, drunk driving laws do little to prevent death, contrary to popular belief, while doing much to ruin lives.  
  
But that's all besides the point. My opponent is advocating the criminalization of drugs, which I have shown to only make matters worse while punishing innocent civilians.  
  
My opponent's crime definition premise is invalid and impractical for the reasons stated last round.  
  
==My Crime Definition Proposal==  
""Following my opponents flawed logic, murder would be legal.""  
No, murder would not be legal for the same reason that rape would be illegal: it is coercion. It is a crime because it infringes on another's ability to govern their ability to govern their life and property. By making this illegal, government is protecting the individual's life and liberty.  
  
Seeing as that was my opponent's only objection to my proposal, it stands.  
  
==Misc.==  
My opponent objects to drugs because they cause violence, but as I have shown, making them illegal only increases this violence.  
My opponent has only warranted his statement that drug use increases crime with a source about how a government drug crackdown killed 33 people, which only further proves my case.  
  
==CONCLUSION==  
Not only do drug laws do more harm than good, they are an infringement of liberty and the coercive authority of government.  
Thank you, and vote CON.

740,"Is the Bible really evidence? The first thing I'd like to point out is that my opponent didn't defend the credibility of the Bible, but simply stated the flaws that exist in the Bible can also exist in science, making science not credible as well. There are a couple of flaws with this statement. My opponent claims that "" You say because it was written by man, it cannot be trusted as evidence "". I'd like to point out that the Pro was the one who said this, not me. I simply quoted what the Pro said to demonstrate that the Bible cannot be used to justify the Pro's claims if he doesn't even think it's credible. As for me, I also don't think that the Bible is credible, but that isn't because it was written by men, it's because there isn't any evidence to support the claims that it makes. The reason that science does not have this flaw is because accepted scientific theories are backed by evidence. But this is besides the point, what I was getting at here is that if my opponent thinks that his own evidence isn't credible, then why should it be accepted as evidence? In short, it shouldn't. The Big Bang I don't even think this is relevant, but I will answer it anyways. To clarify, atheism isn't automatically ""the belief in all science"". Like my definition states, atheism is the lack of belief in a higher power. That's it. You can be an atheist and not accept the theory of evolution or the big bang theory; you can also be an atheist and accept those theories as well. They have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Sure, there may be flaws in the big bang. That's irrelevant. It isn't my job to defend alternatives to the God hypothesis, because the God hypothesis hasn't been proven to be true in the first place. Many people seem to think that because there are no alternative explanations to how the universe was created, then God must have done it by default. This is, of course, another example of the argument from ignorance (where someone asserts that a position is true because it has not yet been proven false). God isn't the default answer, it's a claim that must be proven first. One does not simply accept a claim because there are no alternatives to the claim. It must stand or fall on its own merits. Pascal's Wager The problem that the Pro brought up actually had a name. Blaise Pascal, who was a French scientist, theologian, and mathematician, didn't really believe in the claims of Christianity.[1] However, he chose to accept the God hypothesis since the existence of God cannot be proved or disproved through reason, and there is much to be gained from wagering that God exists and little to be gained from wagering that God doesn't exist. He concluded that a rational person would simply wager that God existed and then continued living their lives. More simply, if one accepts the God hypothesis and is wrong, nothing will happen to them when they die. But, if one rejects the God hypothesis and is wrong, they will be sent to be tortured and burned forever (I thought God was all-loving?). It is therefore a safe bet to conclude that God exists. The problems with this theory arose almost immediately after it was published. Here are my main objections: 1) Belief is not a choice I do not choose to lack belief in God, just as you do not choose to lack belief in Bigfoot. I'm going to assume that no matter how hard you try, you will not believe in Bigfoot's existence until there is good evidence to prove that this claim is true. In the same way, I cannot choose to believe that God exists until I have evidence to prove this. Of course, I can always lie and say that I believe in God's existence. I could go to church every Sunday, sing along to all of the psalms, receive communion, and put my hand on a stack of bibles and say that I think every word in them is true, but your God, who is supposedly omniscient, will know that I don't actually believe that he exists. Thus, as soon as I make this 'wager', it would seem that I am destined for hell regardless. 2) The presupposition of a Christian God I think Homer Simpson said it best when he stated "" Suppose we've chosen the wrong god. Every time we go to church we're just making him madder and madder! "". This raises a valid point: how can you be sure that the Christian god exists? What if it was actually Zeus that existed? Or Vishnu? Or Ra? Simply put, none of these supposed ""Gods"" have been proven to exist beyond a reasonable doubt. So, as Homer would phrase it, the best way to avoid angering one of these gods is to lack belief in any of them, rather than openly worship something else. Status of the debate: 1) The Christian God exists, and he is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. The status quo stands 2) This God created the universe and everything in it The status quo stands 3) This God has sent his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth in order to absolve humanity of original sin The status quo stands 4) Jesus has died for the sins of humanity, and was resurrected three days later to live again The status quo stands Given this status of the debate, I urge a negative vote.

To blithely assert ""well, the arrangement we observe is unlikely, but every other possible arrangement is equally unlikely"" sidesteps the problem rather than actually addressing it.  
  
On modal realism, the probability that there is at least one life permitting universe is 1 (since all possible worlds are real worlds). By inputting the likelihood of given universe being life permitting (assuming that there is only one real universe), we can create a Bayesian inference showing the final probability of modal realism. Assuming that modal realism has a fairly high initial probability (which I established in C2), the final probability would be quite high.  
  
2. Modal realism is parsimonious  
  
Con misunderstands the law of parsimony. He writes ""what you're actually suggesting is that we should just believe in whatever it is that can be explained the quickest."" This is incorrect. What the law of parsimony actually states is that *all other factors being equal,* simpler hypotheses are more likely to be true.[1] This can be verified both empirically by inductive inference and a priori by appealing to epistemic pragmatism.

Burden of Proof By Islamic face veil, I assume Con is referring to the Islamic burqa, which covers the head, face, and body. My opponent, as Con, has the burden to show that the burqa is not a barrier to the integration of Muslim culture in the West. I will argue the burqa is a barrier to integration in the West. Multiculturalism No one can be a multiculturalist in any interesting or coherent sense. Multiculturalists will always resist the force of the cultures he/she tolerates, and stop short of approving other cultures when those cultures generate acts that are offensive to the canons of civilized decency. As Steven C. Rockefeller states, ""important as respect for diversity is in multicultural democratic societies, ethnic identity is not the foundation of recognition of equal value and the related idea of equal rights."" A multiculturalist may enjoy Native American religious ceremonies, but will turn away when those ceromonies include animal sacrifice. Or a multiculturalist may respect other religions, but draw the line when adherents of a religion engage in polygamy. At some point, even the strongest multiculturalist and liberal must be intolerant of another culture's core values. Wearing the burqa is an act offensive to Western culture and should therefore not be allowed. What does the Islamic veil symbolize? Patriarchy The problem with the burqa is that it is one of the greatest symbols ever invented of female humiliation and and oppression. Nazila Fathi, a reporter who has been instrumental in providing the West a perspective on Tehran, wrote the following about the burqa: ""If you want to wear it, go back to where you're from."" According to Fathi, the burqa exists as a tool for men to control their wives. The purpose and effect of the Islamic veil makes it truly unacceptable even by the West's lax standards of what is and is not acceptable. According to the rationalizations provided by Muslim men, women must wear the burqa because, if they don't, men will rape women who show their face in public. Of course, this is absolutely false, a rationalization used by Muslim men to justify repressing women's freedom by claiming they are protecting women. The history demonstratees the true purposes and effect of veiling. In her book Feminism in Islam, Margot Badran provides an extensive history of gender issues in Islam, delving into the history of hijab and the burqa and confirming its status as a symbol of patriarchal control over women. She provides examples that clarify what the burqa symbolizes: the complete exclusion and withdrawal from public life. Women are deprived of all rights. The history of Muslim attacks on the Islamic veil go as far back as 1899, when a Muslim judge, Qasim Amin, claimed veiling was the central political problem facing Egypt at the time. According to Amin, veiling had deprived women of the legitimate rights afforded to them by Islam. Because of veiling, women were not allowed to get an education, nor to have any role in political life. In fact, they were not allowed to have any role at all in public life. Final thoughts Con argues that it is the right of woman to wear the veil. Con has provided no evidence that woman have this right. Given the fact that it symbolizes female seclusion from the public sphere, and from engaging in political life, Con's claim that the veil gives woman the power to have a ""positive impact in society"" is completely unfoudned. It contradicts the history and meaning of the Islamic veil, which Con completely ignores. Con claims that those who see the veil as a barrier are ""ignorant or unaware of why Muslim women practice the veil."" That is, of course, not true. The veil clearly represents the patriarchal oppression of women, which in the West, is not tolerated, not even by the strongest multiculturalists.",1,FourTrouble,"

754,"Since this is the ending round, I will start by thanking the Pro side for this respectful debate. I'm looking forward to the next one! I'd like to thank our readers for their attention as well. I too, think that my adversary is very deserving of winning this debate. I highly affirm that the penalty of death is immoral, criminal and barbaric. The penalty of death is immoral: It is against the highest moral standards and universal human rights; as human life is to be valued more than anything else, whether it be material profit or else thing. The analogy used by the Pro side ""Just as it is sometimes cheaper to throw something out and buy a new one, it is cheaper to execute the worst criminals and put the resources that would go into them into the next generation."" is proof of the immorality of the penalty of death as it values resources over living beings that could be rehabilitated into the society. Every person can be rehabilitated unless they are mentally sick, and in this case, the said person need proper medical care. Killing them is immoral. The penalty of death won't help with poverty either, as crime itself is caused by mental sickness; and/or improper distribution of the resources, and NOT a lack of resources (1). The penalty of death is criminal: Most people seem to entirely focus on the crime, and on the criminal, as if the said criminal was entirely secluded from the society and its members. That is false. It should be known that a lot of the executed offenders have families, relatives, friends and most importantly children. Executed offenders leave behind mothers, children and wives; three of which are now orphans albeit of different kinds... Mothers grieve, wives are left without a supportive income, children are often lead to crime due to the poverty ensuing, as mothers most of the time are not able to provide the critical needs for their children. It's a vicious circle. The penalty of death leads to crime and more crime. The penalty of death is barbaric: ""He has committed a criminal act, and now he will be put to death, voila-tout"", is said. I wish this was true, but unfortunately there is more to the penalty of death than we think. It's not an easy process, especially for the offender who is a thinking, breathing human being. To know that you are going to be killed in two weeks is an insanely painful insight, and it is an excruciatingly monotonous wait, whence every second passing feels like years... and it just doesn't stop there; motion sickness, puking, the absolute mental torture involved in knowing that your life is going to have end to it. Many of these so called criminals have consciousnesses, they have loved ones, they believe in the Christ (I am not taking into account psychopaths, which are maladive states and shouldn't be subject to criminal law in the first place imo). There are many temoinages as well as diaries left by the offenders with descriptions of of unimaginable mental grief; but that is never taken into consideration ""he will be guiotined, it will be quick"", is said. I will leave you with a website documenting the last words of executed offenders in Texas. Not for the faint hearted: <URL>... These people feel regret. They feel remorse. They CAN be rehabilitated. Given a second chance, they would totally take it. They could've been working civilians, productive members of the society. But no, ""ecce lex"". This is the law. Just an example among many others: ""I hope this will bring you peace and I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering. I'm sorry it went on for a terribly long time. I'm sorry to you especially Grace Kehler. To the Kehler, Johnson and Crain family, I pray that you won't hate Jesus, the letter will explain more. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hope that my death will bring you peace and closure. I pray that maybe someday will bring you peace. I hope that you could forgive me, but if you don't I understand.

To say that this person (or the many people found on that website) is ""too far gone"", is an overstatement. Not to mention that most criminals and most violent crimes are not intended to be evil (2). The exclusion here is psychopaths and mental cases. As for Pro side's rebuttal about hypocrisy, it's a non sequitur. Pro admits that the penalty of death is hypocritical, but since all other accepted law penalties are hypocritical as well, then the death penalty should be accepted as moral too.

755,"I will, as previously, address my opponent;s claims point-by-point before returning to the core argument. ""Again my opponent makes a direct comparison to the acts. I am comparing the logic that gay activists use to normalize their behavior. The next logical step is to never let pedophiles out of prison based on the same logic that they use. It is biological and genetic and can't be helped. Whether one is against the law or not is irrelevant to the logic argument. Very, very few people can suppress sexual gratification, they will cave sooner or later, especially a pedophile."" I compare the acts because the difference between them is the key to understanding the difference between what would suffice as a rehabilitation - a pedophile is rehabilitated when he is no longer dangerous, regardless of the non-removable attraction, whereas a homosexual is only ""rehabilitated"" once he is no longer attracted to people of the same gender. Rehabilitation that is sufficient enough to be able to allow a pedophile out of prison is the same kind of rehabilitation that stops him from being a pedophile, or that stops a homosexual from being gay. If we take a look at my opponent's logical conclusions, there are two possible situations: both gays and pedophiles can be ""rehabilitated,"" and therefore pedophiles don't have to stay in prison, or neither can be ""rehabilitated,"" and a pedophile must stay in prison. To quote his own source from a few rounds back, ""Web MD web site ( <URL>... ) states, 'Sadly, there is no cure for pedophilia.' This is true. There is no cure, but there is treatment."" That article ( <URL>... ) goes on to state, more or less, that pedophiles can be treated, or made safer without being cured. Another way of thinking about this is that they remain pedophiles, but are kept safe, through a) treatment, b) close observation while outside of prison, and c) not being let anywhere near children. In other words, they don't have to remain in prison, but are not ""rehabilitated"" either, which directly contradicts both of my opponent's conclusions (either one of which he has been trying to prove). To make it a little bit clearer, at least for logic buffs - my opponent is arguing that ""if a, then b and c, and if not a, then not b and not c,"" where a is ""homosexuality can be cured,"" b is ""pedophilia can be cured"" and c is ""pedophiles can be released from prison."" He even tried to maintain the link by citing the difficulties people can have in always controlling their sexual urges, ignoring the fact that they can be ""helped"" to do so. The article takes as read the following: ""b, but not c,"" which directly contradicts both of my opponent's attempted claims. ""I put this link up to show that the ACLU is attempting to show it is normal to be a pedophile and that they have a right to talk about and lead pedophiles to children. It has nothing to do with bigotry it proves that the same logic is being used both by gay activists and pedophiles. Don't you just love how the ACLU protects us from the unjust suppression of pedophiles and their stalking of little children."" Except that's not supported by anything except the article itself, which has a strong leaning in the same direction as that of my opponent's argument. The ACLU is not attempting to show that being a pedophile is normal - they even say as much in their statement, that they condemn acts of pedophilia. They were attempting to keeps site from being taken down unconstitutionally. This may come as a surprise, but there are very few people out there whose goal it is to corrupt our minds and those of our children. ""My opponents second attempt at saying a bisexual doesn't make a choice is just samantics samantics samantics. 'Process of elimination' Make a choice will ya!!"" First-off, there's a difference between semantic abuse and logical reasoning. Second, there is no choice in preference involved in bisexuality, simply because a bisexual feels no need to choose a preference. It's literally all the same to them - you may as well say that they prefer people. ""My opponent affirms my statement that he minimises child porn as not as bad as molesting children yet children must be molested to constantly fill the needs of pedophiles appetites for new filth to watch."" Not at all. There is a difference between minimization and measurement. One evil is clearly the lesser of the too, and there is no reason not to acknowledge that as long as we keep in mind that both are evil, and that the difference is small. ""My opponents closing remarks are about treatment. This is not what gay activists want, they want their behavior to be considered normal. Treatment is not an option, but some how it is for pedophiles and it is done so at the expense of tens of thousands of children every year."" My opponent takes one last stab at getting away without making sense. No such luck. Even if we assume that he knows what gay activists want, we must again consider that the kind of treatment that is applied to a pedophile does not stop one from being a pedophile, but does (in most cases) stop them from doing anything dangerous. Treatment is as option for pedophiles because it's meant to stop them from molesting or viewing images of children, not to change their sexuality. The only thing that a similar treatment would accomplish in a homosexual is to make them less inclined to act on their sexual orientation, without actually changing said orientation. Having a bunch of gay people walking around and being miserable isn't going to help anybody; keeping a bunch of pedophiles from doing their favorite thing, on the other hand, is a little more useful. If you want to keep your children safe, the best way to do it is to focus on the problems instead of blaming them on somebody else because of some poorly-thought-out hypothetical if-then statement.",1,Levi3o4,"

""My opponents second attempt at saying a bisexual doesn't make a choice is just samantics samantics samantics. 'Process of elimination' Make a choice will ya!!""  
  
First-off, there's a difference between semantic abuse and logical reasoning. Second, there is no choice in preference involved in bisexuality, simply because a bisexual feels no need to choose a preference. It's literally all the same to them - you may as well say that they prefer people.  
  
""My opponent affirms my statement that he minimises child porn as not as bad as molesting children yet children must be molested to constantly fill the needs of pedophiles appetites for new filth to watch.""  
  
Not at all. There is a difference between minimization and measurement. One evil is clearly the lesser of the too, and there is no reason not to acknowledge that as long as we keep in mind that both are evil, and that the difference is small.  
  
""My opponents closing remarks are about treatment. This is not what gay activists want, they want their behavior to be considered normal. Treatment is not an option, but some how it is for pedophiles and it is done so at the expense of tens of thousands of children every year.""  
  
My opponent takes one last stab at getting away without making sense. No such luck. Even if we assume that he knows what gay activists want, we must again consider that the kind of treatment that is applied to a pedophile does not stop one from being a pedophile, but does (in most cases) stop them from doing anything dangerous. Treatment is as option for pedophiles because it's meant to stop them from molesting or viewing images of children, not to change their sexuality. The only thing that a similar treatment would accomplish in a homosexual is to make them less inclined to act on their sexual orientation, without actually changing said orientation. Having a bunch of gay people walking around and being miserable isn't going to help anybody; keeping a bunch of pedophiles from doing their favorite thing, on the other hand, is a little more useful. If you want to keep your children safe, the best way to do it is to focus on the problems instead of blaming them on somebody else because of some poorly-thought-out hypothetical if-then statement.",Society,3,Using-a-gay-activists-logic-a-pedophile-should-never-be-let-out-of-prison./1/,69638

761,"In order to win this debate, I much show that Caucasian-Americans are, on average, more intelligent than African-Americans. The standard measure of intelligence is IQ. Caucasian-Americans (whites) score an average of 100. African-Americans (blacks) score an average of 85, 15 points lower than the white average [1]. The existence of this gap is not in dispute. The cause, however, is. My opponent is claiming that this IQ gap is entirely the result of environmental differences between whites and blacks, with genetics playing no role. I will show that this is clearly not the case, and that, while environmental differences do play a role, whites do have an innately higher intelligence than blacks, on average. IQ and Environment My opponent claims that IQ is mostly a result of environment. This is clearly not true. IQ is almost entirely heritable. A 1996 statement from the American Psychological Association gave a heritability estimate of .75 during and after adolescence, and a 2004 meta-analysis in Current Directions in Psychological Science found that IQ is .85 heritable by age 18 [2]. My opponent's main argument for strong environmental effects is that heritability is much lower at younger ages. He is correct that heritability grows with age, but it is astounding that she finds this as evidence against heritability. It is well known that genes express themselves more as organisms grow. Early on in development in the womb, human fetuses look virtually the exact same as fish, chicken, cows, and numerous other animals [3]. However, as time goes on, genes express themselves more and these species begin to look different. Likewise, humans become more different throughout their lives, as genes express themselves more. The fact that IQ heritability grows with age is evidence for heritability, as it is a central prediction of hereditarians that IQ would become more heritable with age. The fact that it does is evidence for genetic differences. IQ and Malnutrition My opponent argues that malnutrition can lower IQ. In this respect, she is correct. Malnutrition can lead to a lower IQ. However, malnourishment's effect on IQ is not the topic of this debate, the black-white IQ gap is the topic of this debate. In order for this malnourishment point to be relevant, my opponent must do more than show that malnourishment can lower IQ. She must show that malnourishment is a major cause of the black-white IQ gap in America. Another important point is that only malnourishment has been shown to lower IQ. In other words, once an adequate level of nutrition is reached, there is no reason to believe that better nutrition after this point raises intelligence. So, all my opponent has shown is that malnourishment lowers IQ, and malnourishment is very uncommon in America. A common indicator of malnourishment at early ages is growth being stunted. However, only 2.6% of children that are considered poor have stunted growth [4]. Note, that this figure is only among poor children, meaning that growth being stunted is even less common among all children. The fact is that all my opponent has shown is that severe malnourishment can lower IQ. I have shown that malnourishment is not enough of a problem in America to account for the black-white IQ gap and is, therefore, not an adequate explanation for this gap. IQ and Drugs My opponent claims that drug use lowers IQ, and that this helps explain the black-white IQ gap. Once again, she is correct that drug use, especially extreme drug use, can lower IQ, but she is wrong in thinking that this explains the black-white IQ gap. The main reason for this is that black teens actually do fewer drugs than white teens and teens from other races, that also have higher average IQs [5]. Just like the malnourishment point, my opponent needs to do more than show that drug use can lower IQ for this to be serious point. IQ and Biracial Individuals My opponent claims that biracial individuals (specifically those who have one black parent and one white parent) have higher IQs than individual with two white parents. This is an interesting claim, but it is simply untrue. The famous Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study looked at individuals, some with two black biological parents, some with two white biological parents, and some with one black biological parent and one white biological parent, who had been adopted into upper middle class white families. So, the environments were somewhat similiar for all of these groups. At age 17, the IQs of each of these groups had their IQ measured. The adopted children with two black biological parents scored an average IQ of 89, the adopted children with two biological white parents scored an average of 106 IQ, and the adopted children with one biological white parent and one biological black parent scored an average of 99 IQ. So, to summarize, pure white children scored an average of 106, pure black children scored an average of 89, and half white and half black children scored an average of 99 [6]. So, biracial children (as in half black and half white) actually have lower average IQs than whites and higher average IQs than blacks. This is exactly what would be the case if whites had a gentically higher IQ than blacks. I look forward to my opponent's response. Sources: [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>...

763,"Thanks very much for your well thought round. Firstly I will deal with the questions you rasied: 1. Based on the drop in voter turnouts in Austrailia after AV was introduced (to the point where they had to introduce compulsory voting) isn't it reasonable to believe that voter turnouts would drop significantly in Britain also? To keep my answer simple, no it is not reasonable. You are assuming that the reason for low voter turnout in Australia is based on the complexity of the voting system (as you outlined above in your argument). On this point, you must concede that Single Tranferable Vote (STV) (which is exactly the same system but in multi-member consituencies) is just as 'complex'. This is used a large number of countries, some of which have some of the highest voter turn-outs in the world. One specific example I am aware of is Malta (as I am part Maltese). In Malta, all our elections are run under STV and we have one of the highest voter turn outs in Europe. Voter turn-out under First Past the Post is already incredibly low. The public disenchanted with politics. I put to you that AV would reinvigorate politics, and make thousands more people feel that their votes may make a difference. 2. Isn't it hypocritical to argue that FPTP results in minority rule when AV would lead to more coalition governments that give parties with even less support 'kingmaker' status as well as disproportionate political influence? No. I firmly believe it is no hypocritical. If you look at our system from a basic point of view there is a reason the Liberal Democrats would be the natural 'king makers'. They are the most centrist party and are the only party that lie somewhere between Labour and the Conservatives. First Past the Post actually leads to massive continuous swings from left to right and back again in the political spectrum. Now we are pursuing one economic policy, with a swing to the left in 4 years everything could be reversed. That causes instability. Coalition governments - and particularly a coalition with a centrist party - dampen down these effects of huge swings. Politicians have to learn to work together rather than merely take the opposing viewpoint for the sake of it. Indeed, it doesn't always work - and you could very easily argue that the current coalition is failing in some respects. However I would remind you that this was not a planned coalition. Under AV, all parties would have to learn to be more prepared. They would have to learn to accomodate and represent a broader range of peoples. Whether or not a 3rd party is 'kingmaker', the end result will be a government that has the support of over 50% of the population - something FPTP can hardly ever produce. This is more democratic. More people will be represented. 3. You argue that AV will lead to politicians being forced to appeal to a broader section of society. However, won't this lead to supporters of extremist parties like the BNP being given legitimacy because politicians will have to appeal to such people's second preferences? No. While you see the phenomena which you have described above in countries like France where the Front National (far-right party) garner over 10% of the vote in national elections, the BNP are a) very small in the UK and b) would actually lose out massively under AV. This is why the BNP are campaigning for a 'no' vote. While you make a semi-valid point that politicians will have to reach out to a broader range of people, you forget that for a politician to adopt some of the BNPs views in order to gain their second preferences would very often have a counter-effect. By taking on the BNPs views they could alienate either their own voters, or other more moderate voters from choosing them as a '2nd preference'. In addition to this, the BNP have far more chance of success in their own right under First Past the Post. Under FPTP they only need to aim at as low as 25% in some consituencies in order to get into parliament. Under AV they would be looking at the insurmountable target of 50%. While they have never had an elected MP so far, with increasing support in recent years, there is a real possibility under FPTP that in the not too distant future they might succeed. This of course is speculation, but speculation with a very valid basis. Is it complicated? Just to finish of my round here, you raised the point that the child with the chocolate bar is a highly simplified analogy. But its not really. With First Past the Post the public actually have to think more. They have to think about how they should tactically vote. If the person they really want to win has no chance of winning, then they have to vote for someone else to ensure the least favourite candidate doesn't get in. That is complicated. But AV makes it simple. You just list your preferences, and then the count votes tactically for you automatically. All you need to know is to list your preferences 1-however many. And its not forced either. If you want, you CAN just vote for 1 candidate, as you would under FPTP. Listing preferences is just a choice. Thats all there is to understand. I look forward to your closing statement.",1,andyh,"
  
Thanks very much for your well thought round. Firstly I will deal with the questions you rasied:  
  
  1. Based on the drop in voter turnouts in Austrailia after AV was introduced (to the point where they had to introduce compulsory voting) isn't it reasonable to believe that voter turnouts would drop significantly in Britain also?  
  To keep my answer simple, no it is not reasonable. You are assuming that the reason for low voter turnout in Australia is based on the complexity of the voting system (as you outlined above in your argument). On this point, you must concede that Single Tranferable Vote (STV) (which is exactly the same system but in multi-member consituencies) is just as 'complex'. This is used a large number of countries, some of which have some of the highest voter turn-outs in the world. One specific example I am aware of is Malta (as I am part Maltese). In Malta, all our elections are run under STV and we have one of the highest voter turn outs in Europe.   
  
Voter turn-out under First Past the Post is already incredibly low. The public  disenchanted with politics. I put to you that AV would reinvigorate politics, and make thousands more people feel that their votes may make a difference.  
     
     
     
  
2. Isn't it hypocritical to argue that FPTP results in minority rule when AV would lead to more coalition governments that give parties with even less support 'kingmaker' status as well as disproportionate political influence?  
No. I firmly believe it is no hypocritical. If you look at our system from a basic point of view there is a reason the Liberal Democrats would be the natural 'king makers'. They are the most centrist party and are the only party that lie somewhere between Labour and the Conservatives.   
  
First Past the Post actually leads to massive continuous swings from left to right and back again in the political spectrum. Now we are pursuing one economic policy, with a swing to the left in 4 years everything could be reversed. That causes instability. Coalition governments - and particularly a coalition with a centrist party - dampen down these effects of huge swings. Politicians have to learn to work together rather than merely take the opposing viewpoint for the sake of it. Indeed, it doesn't always work - and you could very easily argue that the current coalition is failing in some respects. However  I would remind you that this was not a planned coalition. Under AV, all parties would have to learn to be more prepared. They would have to learn to accomodate and represent a broader range of peoples.   
  
Whether or not a 3rd party is 'kingmaker', the end result will be a government that has the support of over 50% of the population - something FPTP can hardly ever produce. This is more democratic. More people will be represented.   
  
     
     
  
  3. You argue that AV will lead to politicians being forced to appeal to a broader section of society. However, won't this lead to supporters of extremist parties like the BNP being given legitimacy because politicians will have to appeal to such people's second preferences?  
  
No. While you see the phenomena which you have described above in countries like France where the Front National (far-right party) garner over 10% of the vote in national elections, the BNP are a) very small in the UK and b) would actually lose out massively under AV. This is why the BNP are campaigning for a 'no' vote.

I'd like to focus our attention on the sentence between stars. My opponent is absolutely wrong; no where does the Qura'an mean to kill people at any one point. To have such a ridiculous interpretation, one must deliberately abuse the teachings of the Qura'an by taking verses out of context or mistranslating them to come up with what is modern-day terrorism. As an example, there is a verse that is commonly cited that says ""slay the non-believers wherever you find them,"" or something along those lines. The problem is, this verse comes from a historical event- the ""non-believers"" in that passage is very specifically referring to the hostile family of pagan Mecca, the time period during which Muhammad was receiving revelation. Is a nation supposed to recite verses to a violent and armed Godless people like the Meccans were, who literally had a price on Muhammad's head?

They are violence loving extremists who are militantly mobilized; they kill other Muslims, how does that make ANY sense? Because they're NOT Muslims. ""It is also a fact that many Muslims reacted violently when a cartoon depicting Muhammad was published in a Danish newspaper. Is this not a sign of intolerance?"" This is false. It seems my opponent didn't read enough about the event, but here is the truth behind it [2]. As a tl;dr: there is a group known as 'RevolutionMuslim' who claimed to be the violent outcry of Muslims when, in fact, not one Muslim really even cared about SouthPark's cartoon or the Danish newspaper. Meanwhile, this group was run by 2 'Muslims'; in fact, they were 2 zionist Jews pretending to be Muslim who smeared the name of Islam in America, and quite successfully if I may say so myself. At the end of the day, though, my opponent's claims are false. Islam is actually the most tolerant religion in the world that claims ""Let there be no compulsion in religion."" (Qur'an 2:256), read more about it here [3]. ""Also, are Al Quaeda muslims or not?"" No. ""In Christianity, there are people even U.S. congressmen) who would consider a major terrorist attack, or perhaps a major natural disaster, as a god thing, as it suggests the second coming of Christ (it does not take much thought to realise how conter-productive and dangerous such an attitude can be).

In this benevolent act, Saladin was simply emulating Prophet Muhammad as the Prophet reentered his birth-city of Mecca.

""1. I can't use youtube due to internete blocking at school and limet of internet at home so I can't use youtube.""  
  
Understood, as from this point on, I will not use YouTube.  
  
"" spongebob would be like an ant still easy to kill when there is several""  
  
Like I explained earlier, Spongebob can change the size and ability of his body in mere hours. He could also do this through the simply absorption of water. Since the fight will be held underwater, The size in which Spongebob takes up is unpredictable.  
  
""spongebob was only able to absorb the hits: nothing on choke slams and tomb stones""  
Choke: exactly what will this achieve? Since Spongebob is able to split even scatter himself into multiple bodies, he can easily split his bottom self to create a new Spongebob completely independent from its original. Did i mention instant regeneration? Its is another skill Spongebob posses.  
Slam: kinda the same with punches, he can easily absorb the force from the slam. If he is pinned down, he can liquefy himself like he has done multiple times to escape his grasp.  
Tomb stones: Spongebob has been hit by a car, he has fell off multiple cliff, stung by jelly fish, and yes even we shan't forget the episode where the people of bikini bottom harassed his internal organs by punching his lungs, jumping of his brain e.t.c. I am pretty sure a tomb stone is noting new to his inventory of pains.  
  
"". Undertaker is 19-0 at Wrestlemania and he won't loose to Spongebob.""  
Exactly how does this finalize his win against Spongebob?  
  
"". Undertaker has been in Hell in a Cell, Elimination Chamber, Royal Rumble, Coffin Match, Burried Alive, and even hardcore matches. Spongebob has been in a Royal Rumble and Single.""  
  
This might be true, but Undertaker has never fought a cartoon character before. especially one with multiple abilities like Spongebob.  
  
""In the Kung Fu episode if you remember correctly the only reason he defeated the other wrestlers is that hes was being tricked into buying re-estate.""  
  
Yes, but i posted that clip not to show his wins but to demonstrate Sandy's power. If Spongebob can math a character like Sandy in a one on one fight, I am pretty sure his skills as a martial artist is off the scale.

In any case, surely prevention is better than cure? Wouldn't it be better for all concerned if women concentrated their time and efforts on their homes and families and left their husbands to bring home the bacon?

But let's assume the deist's God doesn't interfere with Nature. What next ?

And you didn't show how my examples of beliefs like the Bahai faith was wrong. That said, deism is of practical value in knowing the truth about reality, which matters to everyone and how they live. Furthermore, deists believe that man should follow the pursuit of good based on reason and empathy. As for deism solving life's problems, you may want to reconsider that.

He wrote his book 'On The Age Of Reason' in part to stem the tide of atheism in France during the period of the revolution; you may confirm this by reading the preface of the book. America's founding fathers a number whom were deists like Thomas Paine (also a founding father) specifically emphasized the seperation of church and state because they didn't want religion to be used to oppress people. They may not have done this if they were deists. 2) God can care about a universe he doesn't intervene in. For example, audience of a sport eg wrestling match, baseball etc care about it, but they don't intervene; they aren't allowed to. A father can deeply care about a child who is now independent and since being no longer a minor. Caring about things you don't interact with is very common. 3) Pointing out a hypocrisy undermines a rule being broken; especially if, as in your case, the rule is not consistently applied. You say because the deist's God doesn't care deism is absurd. I reply that the Christian God doesn't care too, now why shouldn't the Christian God be absurd; you still believe in Him and defend Him.

784,"Rebuttal Con begins the final round with questioning what is good. This actually confirms what I've been arguing. Good is good because it is in accordance with God's perfect and unchanging will. For something to be truly good it must be in alignment with a perfect unchanging standard of ""Good"". Only an unlimited omniscient mind can be guaranteed knowledge of ""Good."" Thus, if one does not have infinite power, one's knowledge is likewise limited and thus ""Good"" would be unknown and one could not be truly ""Good"". Con's next argues from his inability to understand God's infinite intelligence. Con actually points out the argument I've been making. The only thing worthy of an infinite intelligence is the infinite nature of God. Thus it is necessary that God be limitless in nature. As previously argued, an infinite mind contemplating something enormous, but not infinite cannot be satisfied. Thus God could never be internally satisfied. This means that his creation of us is an act of evil because over the eons of eternity we would eventually become dissatisfied with the limitations of God. That which seemed beautiful at first would become average and eventually hated because God has given us an internal desire for the infinite, but is only able to provide the finite. To do this with billions upon billions of people would be an incredible act of cruelty and not consistent with the ""Good."" Con's final argument is that if God's love and justice are perfect, there is no need to insist on ""room to grow"". This is a true statement, however Con follows this up with the concept that perfect need not be unlimited. This is not true. Let's assume that a judge perfectly judges someone guilty based on all the information available. You'd say that is just. However, if there was additional information not in the judge's purview at the time of the trial that proved the person's innocence then the judge would have judged perfectly, but unjustly. If this scenario resulted in an eternity in hell, this would be the greatest evil. Thus a limited ""perfection"" is obviously not sufficient for God, and an infinite perfection is ultimately required. To have this infinite perfection requires infinite power to enact anything that the infinite will and mind requires. In Con's conclusion he seems to actually argue my point of the infiniteness of God. This leaves me perplexed as I have been the one arguing for the infinite nature of God whereas Con framed his closing argument stating that I am arguing for a limited nature of God. Yet the very resolution being debated is the infinite power of God - to which Con is arguing against. This all comes as very confusing conclusion and is not consistent with Con's previous arguments. I will once again clarify my stance in my conclusion. Conclusion I will restate my argument again: - If God is not infinitely powerful, he cannot be infinitely intelligent. - If God is not infinitely powerful and intelligent he cannot be unchangeable because limitation implies the possibility for growth and change. - If not unchangeable, then a knowable perfect love and justice do not exist. - The application of any love or justice would be false as we cannot know true love and justice or not. - Additionally, if God is not infinite he cannot be self sufficient, because God would have limits. - If God has limits his love and justice may have flaws and thus not perfect. - If his love and justice are not perfect it would be immoral to condemn people to hell. - If he admitted us all to heaven, we would eventually exhaust the nature of God. - If we could exhaust his nature, we would be in an eternal torment of boredom. Ultimately we would come to hate everything and everyone because instead of them all leading us to something more, we would all be in an eternal state limitation to our mind. Heaven would then be an eternal torment like hell. Thanks to Con for the entertaining debate and to any readers who have made it to the end.",1,Geogeer,"

An interesting idea I suppose but Pro offers no substantiation. Pro just says Cato is backed by corporations. But his new thesis (brought in the last round) requires evidence surrounding the genesis of Cato, not with current affairs so just saying that Cato has received corporate donations is insuficient to show that the basis of its inception was to forward corporate interests. This requires Pro to offer evidence concerning the motivations of Cato's founders, something Pro hasn't even attempted to do. Pro also fails to offer a rebuttal to my point that the policy proposals of right-wing libertarianism would in some instances naturally coincide with those of corporations, meaning the argument fails to prove that Cato's policy proposals are a result of corporate donations as opposed to the ideological bent of the organization. Pro responds by saying that Cato claims to be an independent organization which he claims is false. But why does he say this? Because their interests naturally coincide at some points with corporations. Even so this doesn't prove that Cato isn't independent since Pro hasn't established a causal link from the interests of corporations to the content of Cato. Otherwise it's just a natural coincidence of interests. 2) Pro still hasn't shown why Cato's claims are biased or false. He's just shown that there is opposition. However, even if he shows Cato to be wrong, this doesn't prove corporate-backed bias. Pro also elucidated on his smoking bans point in saying he was referring to public-place smoking bans. Of course, Pro still fails to offer substantiation on why this is (a) wrong, (b) necessarily a result of corporate interests, or (c) why even if it is wrong, why it warrants withdrawing credibility from an entire organization. 3) Pro still hasn't shown why opposition to the FDA or other regulator institutions must be the result of corporate influence and cannot be explained by the ideological bent of the organization since its genesis. See a more full refutation in Point 1 of C1. C2: Cato and Climate Change 1) Pro fails to adequately respond to my point. Basically, Pro is saying that Cato scholars have a different opinion on climate change than him. Therefore they are undeserving of respect. Pro makes this claim without actually establishing why that should be the case. Now instead of backing up his claim in respect to the actual content of Cato's global climate change proposals, Pro is simply saying Cato makes its claims because of corporate donation. For full refutation of this see Point 1 of C1 above. Just because some third party has the same interests as X, doesn't mean X's actions must be the result of that third party. This is especially so in that Cato's ideological bent has been right wing libertarianism since its inception. 2) Pro's rebuttal here isn't actually a rebuttal at all. It's just more claims that conservative think tanks are generally biased. In failing to rebut my counter, Pro drops some important points. For instance, Pro hasn't shown which beliefs of Cato scholars are wrong or why if they are wrong, why that should destroy the credibility of an entire organization. Cato is a policy institute.

790,"We were all new at some point :P Trust me, you're doing fine. The burden of proof The Pro makes a couple of errors when trying to address his burden of proof: 1) Can the bible really be used as evidence? In short, no. But don't take my word for it, allow me to quote the Pro when he said: "" I will start off by saying i understand the flaws in the Bible and in Christianity. The fact that it was written by man is the cause for these flaws. "" This itself demonstrates why we can't look at the Bible as reliable evidence to demonstrate the four areas of proof for the Pro. What are the flaws in the bible? Where do the flaws begin? Where do they end? How can you distinguish flawed information from true information? When a source of information isn't credible in some areas, who's to say it isn't credible in others as well? 2) Can religion or atheism be proven? As my opponent and I agree, no. But how exactly does this stand on a debate over whether or not Christianity is an accurate representation of reality? Well, the fact that religion can't be proven is exactly what makes atheism the most rational position to take. Take a look at the definition I offered in my first post: Atheism - the lack of belief in a higher power. The reason as to why atheism is so appealing is because it isn't making a claim that needs to be justified. Atheism is simply the defense of the status quo. Atheists don't claim that a God doesn't exist, they simply lack belief that one does. As an atheist myself, I reserve my belief for when it is actually proven that a religion is true. Once that is done, I will gladly subscribe to that belief. Until then, I choose to not make a decision between the thousands of different religions that exist because not a single one had offered any justification for their claims. This is what makes atheism the null hypothesis, which is what should be accepted by default when an alternative hypothesis cannot be proven to be true. It is for this reason that it is more rational to be an atheist than a Christian (until, of course, proof can be provided, and I'll leave that area of the debate for the Pro) 3) The presupposition of God The Pro states that if God exists, then he is all powerful, meaning that he created everything, including science. Sure, that would be true, if God existed. In an argument like this, you can't presuppose that a God exists, because if you happen to be wrong, then you argument will be wrong as well. For this argument to count as proof that God is above science, God must be proven to exist first. Does science really support religion? 1) Evolution and the Bible In this argument, the Pro claims that it is possible that the Bible supports the theory of evolution. While I'm glad that the Pro isn't attempting to discredit evolution, I'm disappointed that he didn't give any specific examples of text in the Bible which could support it. Not only that, but this isn't exactly an example of science supporting religion; it's more along the lines of religion supporting science. Even if what my opponent is saying is true, it doesn't give any truth to the other claims in the Bible (e.g: a God existing). These are separate claims that stand or fall on their own merits. 2) The weight of the soul It's alright that the Pro didn't cite this study as I'm familiar with it as well. Unfortunately, this is a study that scientists have not been able to reproduce since the original experiment. This doesn't necessarily mean that the study is false, just that it can't be used to justify any claims made about a soul existing. Among the other errors made in this study, the sample size was also too small to prove anything. The study was done on six humans and fifteen dogs, and like I said earlier, was never replicated. Even MacDougall realized this problem when he said "" I am aware that a large number of experiments would require to be made before the matter can be proved beyond any possibility of error, but if further and sufficient experimentation proves that there is a loss of substance occurring at death and not accounted for by known channels of loss, the establishment of such a truth cannot fail to be of the utmost importance "" [1] Christianity can benefit you as a person. As I said earlier, this argument does nothing to demonstrate the truth of the claims that are being made. Status of the debate: Look back to the argument I made about atheism being the most rational position to take if there is no evidence to justify the claims made by religion. If the status quo stands on any of the four areas of this debate, then the Pro has failed to support Christianity, and we must accept the null hypothesis (atheism).

  We were all new at some point :P  Trust me, you're doing fine.  The burden of proof  The Pro makes a couple of errors when trying to address his burden of proof:  1) Can the bible really be used as evidence?  In short, no. But don't take my word for it, allow me to quote the Pro when he said: ""  I will start off by saying i understand the flaws in the Bible and in Christianity. The fact that it was written by man is the cause for these flaws.  "" This itself demonstrates why we can't look at the Bible as reliable evidence to demonstrate the four areas of proof for the Pro. What are the flaws in the bible? Where do the flaws begin? Where do they end? How can you distinguish flawed information from true information? When a source of information isn't credible in some areas, who's to say it isn't credible in others as well?  2) Can religion or atheism be proven?  As my opponent and I agree, no. But how exactly does this stand on a debate over whether or not Christianity is an accurate representation of reality? Well, the fact that religion can't be proven is exactly what makes atheism the most rational position to take. Take a look at the definition I offered in my first post:  Atheism -   the lack of belief in a higher power.  The reason as to why atheism is so appealing is because it isn't making a claim that needs to be justified. Atheism is simply the defense of the status quo. Atheists don't claim that a God doesn't exist, they simply lack belief that one does. As an atheist myself, I reserve my belief for when it is actually proven that a religion is true. Once that is done, I will gladly subscribe to that belief. Until then, I choose to not make a decision between the thousands of different religions that exist because not a single one had offered any justification for their claims. This is what makes atheism the null hypothesis, which is what should be accepted by default when an alternative hypothesis cannot be proven to be true. It is for this reason that it is more rational to be an atheist than a Christian (until, of course, proof can be provided, and I'll leave that area of the debate for the Pro)  3) The presupposition of God  The Pro states that if God exists, then he is all powerful, meaning that he created everything, including science.  Sure, that would be true, if God existed. In an argument like this, you can't presuppose that a God exists, because if you happen to be wrong, then you argument will be wrong as well. For this argument to count as proof that God is above science, God must be proven to exist first.  Does science really support religion?  1) Evolution and the Bible  In this argument, the Pro claims that it is possible that the Bible supports the theory of evolution. While I'm glad that the Pro isn't attempting to discredit evolution, I'm disappointed that he didn't give any specific examples of text in the Bible which could support it. Not only that, but this isn't exactly an example of science supporting religion; it's more along the lines of religion supporting science. Even if what my opponent is saying is true, it doesn't give any truth to the other claims in the Bible (e.g: a God existing). These are separate claims that stand or fall on their own merits.  2) The weight of the soul  It's alright that the Pro didn't cite this study as I'm familiar with it as well. Unfortunately, this is a study that scientists have not been able to reproduce since the original experiment. This doesn't necessarily mean that the study is false, just that it can't be used to justify any claims made about a soul existing.  Among the other errors made in this study, the sample size was also too small to prove anything. The study was done on six humans and fifteen dogs, and like I said earlier, was never replicated. Even MacDougall realized this problem when he said ""  I am aware that a large number of experiments would require to be made before the matter can be proved beyond any possibility of error, but if further and sufficient experimentation proves that there is a loss of substance occurring at death and not accounted for by known channels of loss, the establishment of such a truth cannot fail to be of the utmost importance  ""  [1]  Christianity can benefit you as a person.  As I said earlier, this argument does nothing to demonstrate the truth of the claims that are being made.  Status of the debate:  Look back to the argument I made about atheism being the most rational position to take if there is no evidence to justify the claims made by religion.  If the status quo stands on any of the four areas of this debate, then the Pro has failed to support Christianity, and we must accept the null hypothesis (atheism).  The four proofs:  1) The Christian God exists, and he is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.  The Pro attempted to prove this using the Bible. Given my response, the status quo stands  2) This God created the universe and everything in it  Same as #1  3) This God has sent his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth in order to absolve humanity of original sin  Same as #1  4) Jesus has died for the sins of humanity, and was resurrected three days later to live again  Same as #1  With that being said, I urge a negative vote.

"" shakuntala must show that beyond any degree that this poem by C. L. Dean is the best poem ever. ""  
  
point 1  
I am comparing deans poem to sonnet 116-which it is claimed by some to be the best love poem ever  
so if I can show why deans love poem is better then sonnet 116 I have shown why deans love poem is the best ever  
  
so lets start with a definition of love  
  http://www.thefreedictionary.com...  
1. A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.  
2. A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance.  
3.  
a. Sexual passion.  
b. Sexual intercourse.  
  
so words like desire feelings of affection sexual desire romance are keys to anylising both poems  
so  
point 1  
sonnet 116  
has no desire feelings of affection sexual desire  
  
proof  
constrast these lines of Shakespeare  
""Sonnet 116  
""Let me not to the marriage of true minds  
Admit impediments. Love is not love  
Which alters when it alteration finds""  
these are lifless words evoking no passion no desire  
  
now see dean poem  
Breathe thy hot breath into my ear  
Breathe thy hot breath that I can hear the pounding of thy heart for I to hear thy soul cry out for I  
  
where Shakespeares is lifeless no passion  
we can hear the desire the passion in these lines  
  
or again these lines  
oh come beloved and make my heart to thud and my veins to sing with thy lips make my ears ring with the love thee does to I do bring oh oh ever so slowly run thy lips o""er the neck of I  
  
now for sexual passion  
tual passion in sonnet 116  
but in deans poem these line  
  
I be the fig mushy soft for the lips of thee  
press thy tongue into me slip its tip up my slit and languidly slither it along the scarlet crease  
run that tongue of thee along the Ganges stream of me  
run that tongue of thee thru the frothy foam that flows fromst my pink rimmed hole to froth o""er the earth like streaming milk white-like like moonlight coating the earth in silvery frost  
  
nothing of a sexual tone is found in Shakespeare  
  
so based on the meaning of love ""desire"" ""passion"" ""feelings "" ""sexual passion"" deans poem is superior to Shakespeare  
thus  
making deans poem the best ever  
  
what con has to do is show us where ""desire"" ""passion"" ""feelings"" and ""sexual passion"" are in sonnet 116 and show us why -if he can find them- Shakespeare rendition of them is super to deans",Arts,1,This-must-be-the-greatest-love-poem-ever/1/,67929
806,"I would like to thank my opponent for responding. My opponent has failed to refute my points about pain. He then uses my argument in saying ""...how would you feel if you heard you are going to be sentenced to electricution or be hung."" There are a few problems with this. First of all, like I stated above not all murderers get the death penalty. Secondly, most murderers do not get the electric chair, I am pretty sure no one gets hung anymore. In most cases today the judges simply give the murderer life in prison. Although the electric chair and life in prison are frightening, it is nowhere near as frightening as being shipped to another country to be eaten. My opponent says that the word 'electric' scares people more than the word 'eaten'. I really doubt that statement, especially since most people know the electric chair does not really hurt. As I briefly stated above, many people do not get the death penalty these days. Instead, they are put in clean prisons, fed well, participate in sports, watch television, write letters, ect... All these things are being paid for by working Americans via taxes. This system is extremely flawed, seeing as they murdered an innocent person. If they were instead shipped to the poor to be eaten, the amount it cost to deal with the murderers would go down. The extra money could be used to build park, schools, or even feed our people. My opponent says that people shouldn't eat other people unless they have to. If my opponent looks at my source, he will see that it states how many people die from hunger. Sending these murderers to poor villages would in the end save peoples lives. Even though there may be side effects, it is better then letting them simply die. My opponent's source proves nothing to the public. There is a fee (which I am not willing to pay) to read the article he provides. The little preview is not enough proof needed for his argument.

Phil gets his ticket and proceeds to security. He gets to the front of the line and takes off his belt and shoes and jacket, which has his pistol in it, and then walks through the metal detectors when a high pitched beeping noise is heard and soon Phil finds himself face down with 7 TSA guards on his back.  
Phil is taken to prison and is considered a ""suspected terrorist."" And if the US legalizes water boarding then this innocent citizen is subject to that treatment.

My opponent talks about currency manipulation, specifically that currency manipulation keeps products cheap and that there is no correlation between unemployment and currency manipulation. Since my opponent does not cite any statistics, one cannot assume that this outweighs any of the statistics that I have cited. Thus, the judge cannot look to this refutation. My opponent's statement that China and unemployment are not connected is inaccurate; studies, such as those from the EPI [1], connect the China-US trade deficit to severe job losses. Currency manipulation plays a critical role in the amount of the deficit [1], resulting in severe negative effects to the economy. The judge cannot look to my opponent's refutations on currency manipulation; thus, my points on currency manipulation still stand. My opponent proceeds to state that because I am not providing clash, his refutations still stand. This cannot be looked to on the ballot. This completely ignores the facts that several of his rebuttals do not even address the contention I was advancing and that the other refutations are outweighed by statistics I provided. The judge cannot look to anything my opponent provides on this contention. Next, my opponent talks about Irani sanctions. My opponent's comment that I do not discuss the intent and that therefore you cannot look to China or Iran as threats is, again, inaccurate. I have shown previously that China has funded Irani weapon programs, which automatically is a threat to the United States. Not only that, but I've shown that China is threatening the United States' cyber security, which in turn threatens national security. Clearly, China is a threat. Since Iran has several weapons programs and is a well-known enemy of the United States, it is clear they are a threat as well. The judge cannot look to my opponent's points on this issue. My opponent is not able to definitely rebut my points on cyber security either; my opponent's first rebuttal is, as I've mentioned before, entirely irrelevant (no matter the US' ability to challenge China, as long as China is attacking and poses a serious threat to US security, the point stands) and his second rebuttal has no evidence or support, just the citation, ""looking at the data"". The judge cannot look to any of my opponent's refutations, and thus my contentions remain standing. Not only do all of my contentions stand, but all of my opponent's contentions fall as well. My opponent's economic impacts are all outweighed by the impacts I raised throughout this debate (especially dealing with the trade deficit), and since all of his contentions are centered around these impacts, all of my opponents' contentions fall.

816,"Before going on to anything else, I will clarify some of the terms stated in the topic. The setting should be limited to democratic countries where the capitalistic distribution is possible, and 'privatized' as letting the distribution and sales of water be responsible to entrepreneurs and companies. In this debate we have to interpret whether water privatization's advantages out weigh the disadvantages, and I say no. This issue has been brought up because some think that a product managed by the private companies and the market increases quality and efficiency. This can be true in some cases of the products, but let me prove throughout this debate why 'water' is exclusive and should be provided by the government. First, let's think about the nature of water. Water is the resource that directly affects human life. Access to potable water is included in the UN human rights charter as well. Because water is related to the rights to life, it should not be regarded as a product, but rather a basic, fundamental human rights service that should be provided to everybody. And sources with qualities like these should be provided by the government. Other sources related to rights of citizens such as basic education, access to electricity and protection of the citizens are all provided by the government, not in the company's hands. The government should be responsible in providing the citizens the basic rights. Second, I will compare the nature of the private companies and government, and state why the government does a better job in providing water citizens. We should keep in mind that the aims of the companies are maximizing profits, not providing water to citizens. In these cases, citizens are not seen as citizens that deserve rights, but rather seen as customers providing profit to the company. And when they don't, their water supplies will be cut. It is true that market economy encourages competition and targets lower price and best quality. However, the company will need to suffer a loss in order to acheive this. And when this happens, the company will turn to making a profit at an expense of either increasing the price or lowering the quality. It is very likely that companis are likely to increase the price of water aiming for profit, because they know it is a life source and people would have to purchase it anyway. In contrast, government targets providing the waters to everyone. Their main goal is to provide their citizens what they need. By this goal, at least the distribution is made. Even if it is underpriced, the citizens get to encounter a source of water. Let's take a look at some of the examples of the countries where the water was privatized and suffered of negative results. In a case of England, where there are sixteen different water companies, even though the price went down from the initial cost, their prices are still five to ten times higher that that of countries where water is provided by the government. Plus, their tariffs increased by 46%. In Tanzania, where it is a developing country, the bills went up for the users. And people turned into unsafe water resources rather than paying the increased bills. These were examples of some of the harms that came with the privatization of water. Finally, let me talk about the environmental harms that can come with the privatization of water. The exploitation and depletion of resources can come. The companies are too much interested in making profits to care about how much resource is actually 'left' to use. Even if there were lack of resources, it wouldn't really matter because little supply can be a good reason for higher demands and increased prices. This might cause the water to be gone, and also affect the plans on various projects in water, such as hydroelectric power or projects in canals. Because water is so exclusive and necessary for life and all citizens, it should be provided by the government and not be privatized.",1,caroline327,"

819,"I thank my opponent for his response. My opponent is making his case based on the effects of anabolic steroids. This is only one type of steroid whereas the resolution calls for the ban of steroids in general. In my argument I contend that if steroids were completely banned from use in all professional sports then athletes that use corticosteroids to treat their conditions would be barred from competition. I will state again that corticosteroids are used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis and allergies. They also are used to treat hay fever, many autoimmune disorders such rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and polymyalgia rheumatica. Corticosteroids are also used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. Sometimes they are injected into joints to reduce joint pain and swelling. If these facts are not enough to convince the voters I will also provide an argument as to why Anabolic steroids do not need to be banned from _all_ professional sports. Anabolic steroids are used to improve and accelerate muscle growth. This gives these athletes an unfair strength advantage and is the main reason that they are banned.

--ZOMG FOUR WEEKS! Is that like the 15 weeks Titanic was #1 or the four weeks Return of the King was #1? Also look at the midweek values. For daily totals Dark Knight dropped down to as low as 3rd last Wednesday and regularly is second for the mid week days.  
  
----  
  
Dark Knight isn't going to make 1.1 billion dollars world wide to offset the all-time grossing list. Dark Knight isn't going to make the 445 million domestically to overtake Titanic's inflation adjusted gross. Dark Knight isn't even going to make the 159 million to overtake Titanic's non-adjusted gross. It'll probably make about 70 million dollars more in the coming weeks. Probably overtaking Star Wars: A New Hope position as #2.

4: Tuvix, is Tuvix and is Tuvok and is Neelix. As a result in the absence of a separate opinion from Tuvok and Neelix only Tuvok has the right to make life or death decisions concerning any of them.  
5: Tuvix combined the abilities of both crew members, but would only require the resources and living space of one crew member in doing so he was far more efficient and useful than Tuvok and Neelix.

832,"I should like to take this opportunity to thank my opponent for accepting this debating challenge in such good humour and also for his very generous remarks. He firstly picked me up on my use of ""the"" preceding ""fat"" but I would contest that this is not inappropriate. After all, we are often approached by charity workers who state that they are collecting: ""money for 'the' blind"" or ""old clothes for 'the' homeless"" or ""spare cakes for 'the' fat"". Well, perhaps not that last one so much, but you see the grammatical point I am making? Reading on, I was highly amused by my opponent's alternative suggestions as to the best ways to resolve the situation to my advantage. If only I'd have thought of them myself! I note with interest that my opponent is clearly familiar with the natives of Aberdeen, lovely people, but a tad cautious with their cash I think it's fair to say. I remember not so long ago was out drinking in Aberdeen with a Chookter (someone from the hills surrounding the city) and an Irish fellow who was rather fond of his glass, if you see what I mean. Anyway, we had been in every pub and bar on Union Street and me and the local lad decided to call it a night because we'd all had a skinfull and, anyway, run out of cash. But Paddy was having none of it. ""No, no"" he said ""I'll lend you each a tenner and we'll get one more round in each"". So we went to the Hen Hoose for one, had one in The Bridge and ended up in The Grill, downing pints of heavy chased by double nips of single malt. Unfortunately, this did for poor old Paddy (the Irish are good drinkers but they can't keep up with the Scots or Geordies, like me) and he collapsed. We took him to the hospital but, sadly, he passed away as the result of alcohol poisoning. Me and the Chookter went to his funeral to say our goodbyes and I placed 10 in his coffin and said ""there's that tenner I owe you Paddy"". Then the Chookter came over, took the tenner out and replaced it with a cheque for 20 and said ""Aye, an' afar ye gaan an' caall m'athin, there's ma tenner aanall""! Sorry, I digress. My opponent made a very good point about the airlines' policies. Most are not willing to insist the fat pay their fair share on planes because they don't want to be depicted as ""sizist"". One notable exception is Southwest Airlines, who have very clear policy on the matter: ""Why ask large Customers to purchase additional seating? We could no longer ignore complaints from Customers who traveled without full access to the seat purchased due to encroachment by a large seatmate whose body extended into the neighboring seat.

Thank you.",1,brian_eggleston,"
  
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my opponent for accepting this debating challenge in such good humour and also for his very generous remarks.  
  
He firstly picked me up on my use of ""the"" preceding ""fat"" but I would contest that this is not inappropriate. After all, we are often approached by charity workers who state that they are collecting:  
  
""money for 'the' blind"" or ""old clothes for 'the' homeless"" or ""spare cakes for 'the' fat"".  
  
Well, perhaps not that last one so much, but you see the grammatical point I am making?  
  
Reading on, I was highly amused by my opponent's alternative suggestions as to the best ways to resolve the situation to my advantage. If only I'd have thought of them myself!  
  
I note with interest that my opponent is clearly familiar with the natives of Aberdeen, lovely people, but a tad cautious with their cash I think it's fair to say. I remember not so long ago was out drinking in Aberdeen with a Chookter (someone from the hills surrounding the city) and an Irish fellow who was rather fond of his glass, if you see what I mean. Anyway, we had been in every pub and bar on Union Street and me and the local lad decided to call it a night because we'd all had a skinfull and, anyway, run out of cash. But Paddy was having none of it. ""No, no"" he said ""I'll lend you each a tenner and we'll get one more round in each"". So we went to the Hen Hoose for one, had one in The Bridge and ended up in The Grill, downing pints of heavy chased by double nips of single malt.  
  
Unfortunately, this did for poor old Paddy (the Irish are good drinkers but they can't keep up with the Scots or Geordies, like me) and he collapsed. We took him to the hospital but, sadly, he passed away as the result of alcohol poisoning. Me and the Chookter went to his funeral to say our goodbyes and I placed ï¿½10 in his coffin and said ""there's that tenner I owe you Paddy"". Then the Chookter came over, took the tenner out and replaced it with a cheque for ï¿½20 and said ""Aye, an' afar ye gaan an' caall m'athin, there's ma tenner aanall""!  
  
Sorry, I digress.  
  
My opponent made a very good point about the airlines' policies. Most are not willing to insist the fat pay their fair share on planes because they don't want to be depicted as ""sizist"". One notable exception is Southwest Airlines, who have very clear policy on the matter:  
  
""Why ask large Customers to purchase additional seating?  
  
We could no longer ignore complaints from Customers who traveled without full access to the seat purchased due to encroachment by a large seatmate whose body extended into the neighboring seat. These Customers had uncomfortable (and sometimes painful) travel experiences, and it is our responsibility to seek resolution to prevent this problem.""

----> Just a rule of thumb. Which seems more plausible: SEX is actually SFX (an inside signature for techies), or that the Disney corportation plotted to sneak in ""subliminal sex messages""?  
  
""Anyway my belief is""  
----> In a debate, this hardly matters.  
  
""because Disney has alot of examples of sexual messages/ pictures, both hidden and plainly visible""  
----> You failed to supply more LEGIT examples of sexual messages/pictures, thus making your point null.  
  
My opponent has failed to bring up any new point in refutation of the ones I offered.

It should be crystal clear that my opponent drops this argument.

""Removed or not, it's still there. Have you ever had a friend who did something really bad to you and later said sorry after it? The action still remains, and it will always remain.""  
----> There's several things to consider however:  
1. Further editions removed it  
2. You have failed to give proof that Disney corportation inserted these pictures, and not some person who did it behind-the-lines. If this was perpertuated by one person, then Disney shouldn't be at blame.  
  
""but subliminal messages are ment to catch you off-guard and subconsiously make you think about something.""  
----> And what demonsratable effects have arised from these examples from Disney?  
  
=====Conclusion=====  
  
My opponent has conceded several of his points,and dropped one of his arguments. He has failed to show why Disney corporation should be shut down EVEN if they were rightly accused of inserting sexual images. He has failed to show they were even inserted by Disney. Having failed his burden, I urge readers to vote PRO.",Education,2,Disney/1/,14283

850,"Same, just line by line. Some of it might be messy or repetitive due to how some of the arguments are fundamentally the same. Ok, the quote is dropped then. I will concede that a crime against humanity is ""murder or an inhumane act against a civilian"". Although I concede that the USfg should not be locked up in jail for killing soldiers, the definition still works against the affirmative. A ""crime against humanity"" is any inhumane act against a civilian. This inhumane act does not need to be on the governmental level, but on an individual level. By my opponents own definition places the foundation that a ""crime against humanity"" is anything bad that is ""inhumane"" against a civilian. As you can see, this definition is so very broad. There are hundreds of definitions of ""inhumane"", what does inhumane entail? Leaving one starving? A hate crime? Tripping someone when walking down the street can be classified as inhumane because the word itself is ""not-humane"". Dictionary.com says ""humane"" is defined as ""characterized by tenderness, compassion, and sympathy for people and animals"". Now I am not trying to stick the affirmative with having to prove every ""not compassionate"" act should be tried, but my point is simple. Inhumane acts occur all the time, every crime in the US can be defined as ""inhumane""- even by his own definition. This would cause for the United States to have to give up its autonomous judicial system for even domestic crimes. We will have a world ""standard"" for what is a crime, and how to deal with that specific crime. Doing this on an international level strips every country of its own identity. Countries that have one predominant religious system will have to change their laws in order to conform to what the new ""international"" order says is ok. Even if the USA is not what chooses the punishment, the independence of the country is still taken. At this point, when the USA loses its individuality and merely conforms to a world order you cannot vote for the affirmative team. All of the laws worldwide will have to conform to what the ""consensus"" says is ok. Religions are different, some religions call for huge punishments on little crimes such as stealing. Succumbing to the international judicial system will violate those countries values, and strip us of our individualism. The first thing my opponent is going to say is that ""I am not advocating other countries to come into it also"" but at his arguments base, he is. His value criterion can only be accessed when the entire world is ""Equal"" onto the ""equal"" judicial system. So although he is not directly advocating for other countries to join, he cannot access his value or value criterion until he can prove why it is good for every country to be a part of the system. On his first contention- Yes, I agree that the US has not done a great job of punishing crimes against humanity. However, the policy that is needed is not one of giving up our individuality and succumbing to an international order if anything is to be done, we should change America at the individual level, not give in to other people standards. First- He says they cant make laws, only prosecute Second- No one country can lead the court Only providing two answers to this argument was a fatal flaw by the affirmative team. I concede they can only prosecute, but the way in which they prosecute will be based on western philosophy. The second point he makes is the last leg he stands on and really the only standing defense in the round. When I believe that you should have already made your decision based on the fact America will have no individual say and it will violate other countries religions, I will still defeat this to leave absolutely no doubt in your mind. However, even if I do not, the previous arguments are still enough to vote on. Onto his second point. (Pretty much the rest of the debate grouped) At this point he is standing behind the quote of Madeline Morris to defeat the logic that I presented. The problem is that the Morris quote does not even apply in a world post plan. She says that not one country has control, but you have to look to the fact that the countries involved now are just random countries with absolutely no pull in the world so of course 1 country does not have any more pull than another. When the hegemon United States of America steps in they will mold the decisions based on the United States values and nothing will change at all. He can say that safeguards are put in, but you have to look to the fact that the United States will be the ones catching the criminals, they will feel as if they have more pull then the other countries because they actually caused for the capture of the criminal. The record of the ICC is pretty horrible, they have only put out warrants for 12 arrests and only a couple have actually been tried. The United States will see that and think ""we are the one arresting everyone, we should try them based on what we say"" and then status-quo still happens. So if the United States, and the world, followed suit we would see no variation in the realm of judicial systems. This is bad. When you take this away religious standards are not met, and a country has no independence. Independent countries are needed in America because this stimulates competition between them all and moves society as a whole forward. Seeing that the affirmative calls for every country to be the same in their ethics calls for an immediate vote for the negative. When every single attack against a citizen must be taken to the international court, you have no alternative but to vote for the negative. Thank you affirmative debater, I am thankful this debate has been kept on friendly terms and has remained very competitive. Thank you",1,fresnoinvasion,"

These particles, as is evident from their names, carry the four forces in our world: the electromagnetic force, gravity (we're still searching for evidence for this force carrier), the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Respectively these are photons, gravitons (still hypothetical), gluons, and the W and Z bosons. Here's the crazy part: at temperatures in the universe today these particles exist together. However, we have reason to believe that at the beginning of the universe the four forces were all carried by a single particle. That is, instead of these five little particles running around mediating forces, we had one doing all their jobs. Also, forces diminish in strength with distance. Imagine that there was only one gigantic planet in the universe. As you get closer, you feel its gravitational pull more. But the further you get away, the weaker the pull. In our universe with three large spatial dimensions, gravity diminishes by a rule called the inverse square: 1/r^2, where 'r' is the distance from the object. So if I am 10 meters from the object, the force felt is 1/100 as strong. However, if our universe had only two large spatial dimensions, gravity would diminish by the rule 1/r. 10 meters away, gravity would be 1/10 as strong. This is only one example (electromagnetism follows the same rule) in which the laws of physics can change. 2)Areas which can neither be proved nor disproved. Mongeese does not address my argument on areas which can neither be disproved nor proved. The Continuum Hypothesis, for example physically cannot be proved nor disproved. If a set of over-arching laws existed, surely they would describe all of math. Mongeese's arguments necessitate the existence of a complete set of mathematical laws which we are moving closer to. However, such a set of laws which encompass all of math are impossible to achieve, which is demonstrated by such areas. If therefore no such set of laws exist, then math is something we are laying down for ourselves. To summarize the above two points, just because something is a science doesn't mean it has a set of always-existent laws, and even in fields where such laws exist, the laws are not unchangeable. ""Applied math, such as physics, is different from regular math, as you already said..."" I was noting that physics is pure mathematics which we have molded to describe the real world. We prove different things about infinity, adding to the laws of mathematics. ""The concept is just sitting out there, laughing at our mistakes, waiting for us to finally discover and prove what it really is"" The concept is constantly growing, like a silent sapling (also metaphorical). ""Math is both very abstract and very real"" And yet we develop areas of math without application in the real world. Fields like number theory which do not have bases in real world problems defy this argument. In conclusion, a set of over-arching mathematical laws cannot exist as there are areas which cannot be explained. Just because a study is a science does not mean it will have laws, and laws that are present can change. The laws of mathematics are changeable, and the resolution is CONfirmed (negated).",1,ToastOfDestiny,"

If members would be banned for forfeiting, let's say, 4 debates in a month, members suffering from an untimely internet loss, computer problem, family emergency, etc. could still be banned in a matter of days. There would be no special circumstances for ""severe cases"" under any of your proposed systems and well-intentioned debaters would be banned because of bad luck. Also, you have presented at least four different punishment systems at this point, uncovering another flaw in your premise: each method suggested is imperfect and will inevitably punish those who you admit do not deserve it. 2.

863,"I thank Zaradi for participating in this debate, especially considering he wasn't very familiar with Batman at the start. I hope this has made him a bigger fan! Why Pro Can't Win Before I recap my case and address Pro's new argument, allow me to briefly explain how Pro has sabotaged himself in this debate. In Round 1, Pro laid out two contentions meant to prove Batman is a positive role model: Batman is a good guy and he works where the police can't. Last round, however, he dropped both of these contentions and focused only on attacking my case. In doing so, perhaps unintentionally or perhaps as a result of my rebuttals, Pro just conceded the only affirmative arguments in favor of the resolution. Without these arguments, Pro cannot prove Batman to be a positive role model, he can only hope to negate my case. In other words, Pro made it impossible to affirm the resolution. He can't win. What Pro Has Conceded The following list compiles the points that Pro conceded to in this debate. Combined or separate, they clearly paint the picture of what society would deem a ""bad"" role model. Not only are his motives and actions not to be applauded, but if they were emulated, the physical, emotional, social, and legal ramifications would be devastating: Batman is a career criminal, committing literally thousands of offences, ranging from theft to attempted murder. Batman exhibits an extremely aggressive, sociopathic, self-destructive mentality. Batman has raised and trained a half-dozen teens and pre-teens for battle, leading many to death, disability, and/or serious psychological trauma. Batman's so-called ""good deeds"" are always the result of illegal and highly dangerous methods. Batman regularly interferes with and inhibits police operations in his own city. Pro's New Argument Pro makes two claims here. First, he states that my arguments cannot be understood by youths and thus should not be considered. However, as I explained last round, my arguments - Batman breaks the law, is crazy, and hurts kids - could not be more straightforward and universally understood. One does not need to understand the sociological implications of renegade justice to know that it's not okay to beat people up or run from the police, nor does one need a masters in psychology to know that it's not normal to live in a cave all alone for the rest of your life. Also, notice that Pro doesn't mention Batman's child abuse AT ALL. Could it be because there is nothing more obviously bad to kids than ABUSING KIDS? Pro's second claim is really his downfall. He states that because kids think Batman is a positive role model, he is a positive role model. However, Pro already conceded that Batman's crimes, sociopathy, and child abuse make him a negative role model. He just proved those kids wrong! Batman is a role model alright, but simply being admired does not mean he is worthy of admiration. Kids might also think bullies are popular and strong or killers are cool and powerful, but that doesn't make their deeds positive. Pro says as much himself: ""The methods, while maybe more important to older viewers, are not important to the younger viewers, who are more likely to model their actions after someone they view as a role model."" Those old enough to understand Batman's negative traits do not consider him a role model, and those too young to understand these traits are modeling negative actions without yet realizing it. That doesn't somehow make him a positive role model, it simply means the children have a bad role model. Summation So that's it. Pro conceded my entire case, his entire case, and presented a new and completely faulty argument in the last round. Batman is a negative role model. The resolution is negated. There's really nothing more to say, except... . . . . . . . . . .",1,Maikuru,"
  
  I thank Zaradi for participating in this debate, especially considering he wasn't very familiar with Batman at the start. I hope this has made him a bigger fan!  Why Pro Can’t Win  Before I recap my case and address Pro’s new argument, allow me to briefly explain how Pro has sabotaged himself in this debate.   In Round 1, Pro laid out two contentions meant to prove Batman is a positive role model: Batman is a good guy and he works where the police can't. Last round, however, he dropped both of these contentions and focused only on attacking my case. In doing so, perhaps unintentionally or perhaps as a result of my rebuttals, Pro just conceded the only affirmative arguments in favor of the resolution. Without these arguments, Pro cannot prove Batman to be a positive role model, he can only hope to negate my case. In other words, Pro made it impossible to affirm the resolution. He can’t win.   What Pro Has Conceded  The following list compiles the points that Pro conceded to in this debate. Combined or separate, they clearly paint the picture of what society would deem a “bad” role model. Not only are his motives and actions not to be applauded, but if they were emulated, the physical, emotional, social, and legal ramifications would be devastating:  
  
  Batman is a career criminal, committing literally thousands of offences, ranging from theft to attempted murder.  
  Batman exhibits an extremely aggressive, sociopathic, self-destructive mentality.  
  Batman has raised and trained a half-dozen teens and pre-teens for battle, leading many to death, disability, and/or serious psychological trauma.  
  Batman’s so-called “good deeds” are always the result of illegal and highly dangerous methods.  
  Batman regularly interferes with and inhibits police operations in his own city.

This argument was NOT about the integrity of Joseph Smith, it was about the fact that the LDS church is the closest to what Jesus established while he was here. The fact that you do not believe that God would encourage that violence within people only deepens my point that it was the Devil.

Would the Devil not encourage that; seeing as it draws people away from God? My response to your question ""Why would God send someone after Jesus?"" is EXACTLY. God didn't send those evils after Jesus; the Devil did in order to destroy what was good and pure and drawing men closer to God and truth. As for baptism... The LDS church also believes that before you get baptized you must accept the meaning of it. You're not supposed to be baptized unless you understand the symbolic meaning of it. The LDS church *again* DOES worship Christ, our Savior, and God the Father; NONE ELSE! His word IS all that matters and the LDS church and I believe that.

Law enforcement agencies in Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse have reported an increase in drug-related violence resulting from an influx of Jamaican criminals who are challenging drug distribution areas long controlled by local marijuana distributors. Cannabis cultivation occasionally is associated with violent crime in New York. Typically, growers cultivate cannabis outdoors with booby traps situated among and around the plants.

881,"Thanks again to my opponent for this debate. Readers, please disregard the first two rounds. To the debate! I negate: McCain is not fit to be president. ""VOTING FOR MCCAIN IS ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF BUSH"" - This is a common talking point - you might as well say a campaign-driving catchphrase said as often as ""Change!"" and ""Hope!"" - of the Obama camp. Unfortunately, my opponent provides no support for this assertion in her argument, except a vague reference of how Bush and McCain have similar viewpoints on ""the Surge"" in Iraq and the military in general. Also unfortunate for her is that ""the Surge"" worked, at least ostensibly. <URL>... <URL>... I hasten to bring out the contrast of the politics of the newspapers The Wall Street Journal, known in the mainstream corporate media to be generally ""on the right,"" and The Washington Post, known to stand on the left of things. (Amazingly, both papers are able to have these slants and still be bastions of objectivity in the journalism world.) ""Nearly all of Senator McCain's ideas, plans, and morals are identical to those of President Bush."" -Really? I see one plan, about the direction the country should take in the Iraq War, and no ideas or morals of any kind to compare. Because they agree on military strategy does not make them identical, no matter how many times the Obama campaign says it. As far as the wonderful statistics that you go on to cite are concerned, none of this makes McCain unfit to be president. Bush *is* the president, and he is responsible for the things in the first place. So there is the precedent that none of these things disqualifies one from being president, as Bush is still president, even after the fact. (As a sidenote: Shame on the Huffington Post. They totally ripped off Harper's magazine with the format that they presented their statistics in. Harper's should sue.) ""My guess is this does not help the economy. You think McCain would learn from his friend's mistakes, but apparently not. Let's not go there again.

Thanks again to my opponent for this debate. Readers, please disregard the first two rounds.  
  
To the debate!  
  
I negate: McCain is not fit to be president.  
  
""VOTING FOR MCCAIN IS ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF BUSH""  
  
- This is a common talking point - you might as well say a campaign-driving catchphrase said as often as ""Change!"" and ""Hope!"" - of the Obama camp. Unfortunately, my opponent provides no support for this assertion in her argument, except a vague reference of how Bush and McCain have similar viewpoints on ""the Surge"" in Iraq and the military in general. Also unfortunate for her is that ""the Surge"" worked, at least ostensibly.  
  
  http://www.washingtonpost.com...  
  http://online.wsj.com...  
  
I hasten to bring out the contrast of the politics of the newspapers The Wall Street Journal, known in the mainstream corporate media to be generally ""on the right,"" and The Washington Post, known to stand on the left of things. (Amazingly, both papers are able to have these slants and still be bastions of objectivity in the journalism world.)  
  
""Nearly all of Senator McCain's ideas, plans, and morals are identical to those of President Bush.""  
  
-Really? I see one plan, about the direction the country should take in the Iraq War, and no ideas or morals of any kind to compare. Because they agree on military strategy does not make them identical, no matter how many times the Obama campaign says it.  
  
As far as the wonderful statistics that you go on to cite are concerned, none of this makes McCain unfit to be president. Bush *is* the president, and he is responsible for the things in the first place. So there is the precedent that none of these things disqualifies one from being president, as Bush is still president, even after the fact.  
  
(As a sidenote: Shame on the Huffington Post. They totally ripped off Harper's magazine with the format that they presented their statistics in. Harper's should sue.)  
  
""My guess is this does not help the economy. You think McCain would learn from his friend's mistakes, but apparently not. Let's not go there again. The people of our country need help now more than ever.""  
  
- I assure you, Bush and McCain are not friends. Bush is simply a plain moron. McCain is actually an ok guy, in my opinion, that happened to get stuck with the legacy of Bush as the Republican nominee.  
  
""Graduated next to last in his class, and spent his school years partying. Hmm... Good role model for America? Maybe not.""

Perhaps, however at the same time that the Western Allies were fighting 150,000 German soldiers in Africa, the Soviet Union was fighting 3.5 million on the eastern front. The Soviet Union might have won even without the help of the Western Allies. ""The dissolve of the Nazi German Economy was the major factor that lead to the downfall and ultimate defeat of Nazi Germany."" And that was brought about by the Soviet Union, not the Western Allies. ""From late 1944 on, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945 (Stunde Null). Food became drastically scarce.

Nobody doubts the damage done to Germany by Western Allied bombings. The bombings killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and destroying many factories and cities, one of the greatest crimes of WWII. The bombings however had no impact on the outcome of the war, just like D-Day had no impact on the outcome of the war.

""If the western allies hadn't been there to distract the USSR would haven't had the ability or the power to get threw the defense of Nazi Germany."" That is a possibility. However like you said, the Western Allies distracted Germany. They did not defeat Germany. ""The reason that the USSR was able to even push Germany back has to due with failure of re supplies; without that the Nazis would have even won the battle of Stalingrad."" Completely untrue. The only reason Hitler lost in the east was because of Hitler's mistakes. ""All together the western allies made up a bigger force then that of the German western campaign."" I would agree with you there. Overall, the western allies had more men than Germany, as did the Soviet Union. However this does not prove your point. ""The western allies also preformed operation torch which managed to cut of Germany from some precious fuels."" Actually it was the oil in Romania that the Soviets captured which cut Germany off from fuel. There was no oil in Africa. Africa had no economic importance. Conclusion: Not only does Con use incorrect English, he has many incorrect facts. His strongest argument is that without the Western Allies the Soviets would definitely have lost. Not only is that untrue, the Soviets might still have won without the Western Allies, it is not an argument since without the Soviet Union, the Western Allies would most likely have lot.",1,STALIN,"

884,"OK I suppose I should have done that initially. To begin would be to mention a common counter argument which is that not teaching a child religion is the same as teaching them one. This is a fallacy because even if the parents are non religious people they are not demanding the child except some ultimate claim about the universe. If the parents are atheists they should not just say ""ok son you have to be an atheist"" just as a Muslim, Jew or Christian should not do the same. But by not passing down your religion to your child by indoctrination or force (force being I'll ground you if you do not go to church etc..) you are in no way acting as the opposite equivalent. I mention this first because I did not want to have to deal with the fallacy later wasting time. Now for an argument against. Well first of all this is in a great sense removing a persons right to religious freedom which has no age limitations. A parent does not have the right to make their child practice a religion. If a child refuses to go to church with them they do not have the right to punish them for not coming nor force them to in anyway. Would one let a Satanist parent force their child to go to a service? One could say 9 times out of 10 one would say no but we let other religions do it by the millions and think nothing of it even though it is the same thing. To continue this is indoctrination which keeps the child from being able to make decisions about religion in the future that are more thought out. No to say this makes someone stupid, NOT AT ALL, but you can understand the logical fallacy of saying I'll raise them Christian and then when they move out they can make up their mind about this stuff just fine. If a child is not forced to practice a certain religion while growing up this would allow them to critically evaluate religion rather than look at it through the lens of the religion they were made to believe. From my own experience (perhaps worthless) I was raised catholic and even when finally allowed to see religion for myself I found that I was making judgement about Islam, Judaism and non believing based on my own catholic beliefs rather than critically thinking about the claims/reasons for all this. It took me years to myself out of that hole so that I could view religions on a fair and logical basis. Yes I am atheist but I could have chosen any other religion. Plenty of people are raised without religion and later join one thus logical fallacy in saying you are taking religion away from the child forever. We do not label our children as Republican, Democrat etc why label them with religion and raise them so that they are forced to accept an ultimate truth they don't get to evaluate critically.",1,Charliecdubs,"

886,"Ave. The cosmological argument is a simple argument for the existence of god. The premises go like this: 1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause. 2) The universe began to exist. 3) The universe had an (uncaused) cause. [1] The argument is in a logically valid Modus ponens. [2] If everything that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then it logically follows that the universe had a cause. The only issue with this argument is the truth of the premises. Therefore, I will attempt to demonstrate the premises to be true. Premise one is based on the Principle of Sufficient Reason.[3] The Principle of Sufficient Reason is a philosophical principle postulating that everything must have a reason for its coming into being. I think that there are very good epistemological reasons to accept the PSR as true. How would we practice science if things came into being without any cause? Science is predicated on the idea that there are explanations for why things happen, and we should go out and discover the cause of why it happened. It's deeply anti-scientific to suggest that things can begin to exist without reason. [4] There are three major explanations for the origin of the universe. The universe came from nothing [5], the universe existed eternally [6], and the universe had an absolute beginning [7]. The hypothesis that the universe had an absolute beginning is the most convincing of these three, so premise two is upheld. Let's investigate the three hypothesis and their plausibility. The universe couldn't have come from nothing. This is affirmed by the metaphysical principle ex nihilo nihil fit [8]. In English, this means ''Out of nothing, nothing comes''. There is no way for something that exists to come from a state of absolute nothingness. I'll give two arguments as to why this is true. Firstly, the potentiality argument. If there is a state of absolute nothingness, then there is no potential for anything to happen. If there is no potential for anything to happen, then there is no potential for a universe to come out of nothing. Therefore, it is impossible for the universe to have come from state of absolute nothingness. Secondly, the property argument. If you have absolute nothingness, then you have the universal negation of everything. Logically, you would then have the universal negation of all properties. But if something can come from nothing without cause, then that nothing does have a property. The property of something coming from it. By definition, something cannot come from an absolute nothingness, because then you never had an absolute nothing to begin with. An eternal universe would require an absolute beginning. Cosmologists have explored the mathematics of an eternal universe and concluded that it had a beginning. Even if the universe existed forever, it still began to exist, so the eternal universe hypothesis does not refute premise two. [9] All of the current astrophysical evidence demonstrates that the universe began to exist. On Steven Hawking's seventieth birthday, cosmologists gathered to discuss the current state of cosmology. Physicist Alexander Vilenkin concluded his speech by saying , ''All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning''. [10 ] There are also philosophical reasons to believe that the universe had a beginning. If the past existed eternally, then there would be an infinite number of events occurring before the present moment. If there were an infinite number of events occurring before the present moment, we would never reach the present moment. However, we have reached the present moment. Therefore, the past could not have existed eternally. [11] The cause of the universe beginning to exist is most plausibly god. The cause would exist before time, space, and matter, because it caused them to exist. The cause is, therefore, timeless, spaceless, and immaterial. The cause is most plausibly personal as well. I quote Apeiron, DDO geophysicist and philosopher: '' If you walk into your kitchen as ask, ""why is the kettle boiling?"" two types of explanations can be given but only one is sufficient - the first type is a scientific explanation: that the water is heated to a point where atoms speed up their collisions, etc. But the second explanation is a personal one in terms of will or volition, ""I wanted to make you tea."" In some contexts it would be inappropriate to give one explanation over the other. Now the universe can't be given a scientific explanation since it's the cause of space and time we're talking about here, there's no spatio-temporal thing before or beyond space and time so it couldn't be accounted for in terms of laws operating on initial conditions. It can only be accounted for in terms of personal explanation in terms of volition, a personal explanation. '' [12] It's also important to note that something which can cause the universe to exist must be extremely powerful, which suggests omnipotence. In conclusion, the cosmological argument establishes a cause of the universe that is timeless, spaceless, immaterial, eternal, personal, and probably omnipotent. Using inference to the best conclusion, this cause is most likely god. Vale. References [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>... [5] <URL>... [6] <URL>... [7] <URL>... [8] <URL>...

888,"First I thank Pro for this entertaining debate. She's offered a good perspective of her side and brought up points I hadn't thought of, though she apparently forgot to run the spell check in her last round. Its still been a good clash. In compliance with tournament rules the last round is a conclusion. I'm keeping this under 4000 characters and ask my opponent to do the same. I'm gonna make this easy for the judges and just state the main points you should vote on. 1. Vote on universal timeline Remember the argument I brought up last round, that after 10^40 years, all nucleons will have decayed. Nucleons make up almost everything in the universe. With no nucleons there will literally be nothing except you and black holes. Because our immortal must live 10^100 years, that equates to 10^60 years you have to live, with essentially nothing. No Internet, no electricity, no nothing. My opponent says that it wont be all bad because we can actually go into one of those black holes and see whats inside them. This is probably the strangest argument I've ever seen. First off, the gravity inside a black hole is so strong that you would literally be immobilized the second you entered and would never be able to move again due to the gravity weighing you down. Second, seeing whats inside a black hole would only fascinate you for so long. After a few days you'd want to leave, but you couldn't because the gravity is too strong. Seriously, voluntarily going into a black hole makes no sense. This means there's really nothing for you to do for 60% of your ""lifespan"". A universe with no sustainable objects puts a new meaning into sensory deprivation. 10^60 means 10 with 60 zero's added onto it. Thats how many years an immortal would have to live with basically nothing in the universe. Prefer mortality. Its not even close. 2. Vote on human extinction Her argument for immortality that she introduced in R1 is entirely predicated on humans being around. She's conceded that an immortal will live so long that life with humans will equal .000000001% of their life. This is extremely negligible, making Pro's benefits minuscule. Pro also straw man's my Memory argument. I never said the immortal would forget life with humans due to psychological memory problems (or amnesia). I said that they just might naturally forget over time. Just as we all probably forgot what happened on our 5th birthday party, because it was so long ago. We forget things all the time. This is no different. Finally, she says that if an immortal isn't motivated to maintain energy sources (like electricity) by themselves. then they just don't want it enough. This is absurd. An immortal is going to want electricity. They'll want the internet. They'll want sources of entertainment. But look back at all the things I listed last round, that are necessary to keep things like electricity, when all other humans die out. No one would be motivated to do all those things no matter how much they wanted to keep energy sources. The fact is that we need other humans around to keep our electricity running, to keep our cars working, and to keep updating our iPods. When they finally go extinct, someone who lives forever will not have access to these and will not be able to do the abundance of tasks necessary to maintain them. Its common sense. 3. Vote on planetary destruction Pro drops my argument that we may not develop advanced space travel before earth is destroyed. This is huge. If Earth were to collide with another planet, be torn up in a nuke war, or be hit by an asteroid, she cannot guarantee that an immortal would be able to escape the devastation. The most likely scenario is that because they wouldn't die in the explosion, they'd simply be thrust into space where they would float meaninglessly for who knows how long, before they run into another celestial body. Which probably is nothing like Earth, and likely is just a large barren rock, on which life is pretty meaningless. Immortality has short term benefits but is not worth it in the long run.",1,BlackVoid,"

Seriously, voluntarily going into a black hole makes no sense.   This means there's really nothing for you to do for 60% of your ""lifespan"". A universe with no sustainable objects puts a new meaning into sensory deprivation. 10^60 means 10 with 60 zero's added onto it. Thats how many years an immortal would have to live with basically nothing in the universe. Prefer mortality. Its not even close.  2. Vote on human extinction  Her argument for immortality that she introduced in R1 is entirely predicated on humans being around. She's conceded that an immortal will live so long that life with humans will equal .000000001% of their life. This is extremely negligible, making Pro's benefits minuscule.  Pro also straw man's my Memory argument. I never said the immortal would forget life with humans due to psychological memory problems (or amnesia). I said that they just might naturally forget over time. Just as we all probably forgot what happened on our 5th birthday party, because it was so long ago. We forget things all the time. This is no different.   Finally, she says that if an immortal isn't motivated to maintain energy sources (like electricity) by themselves. then they just don't want it enough. This is absurd. An immortal is going to   want   electricity. They'll   want   the internet. They'll   want   sources of entertainment. But look back at all the things I listed last round, that are necessary to keep things like electricity, when all other humans die out.   No one   would be motivated to do all those things no matter how much they wanted to keep energy sources. The fact is that we need other humans around to keep our electricity running, to keep our cars working, and to keep updating our iPods. When they finally go extinct, someone who lives forever will not have access to these and will not be able to do the abundance of tasks necessary to maintain them. Its common sense.  3. Vote on planetary destruction  Pro drops my argument that we may not develop advanced space travel before earth is destroyed. This is huge. If Earth were to collide with another planet, be torn up in a nuke war, or be hit by an asteroid, she cannot guarantee that an immortal would be able to escape the devastation. The most likely scenario is that because they wouldn't die in the explosion, they'd simply be thrust into space where they would float meaninglessly for who knows how long, before they run into another celestial body. Which probably is nothing like Earth, and likely is just a large barren rock, on which life is pretty meaningless.   Immortality has short term benefits but is not worth it in the long run.",Philosophy,3,Immortality/1/,27570
889,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank my opponent once again for engaging in such an interesting debate with me. I wish him the best of luck during the voting period. First of all, I apologize if I exaggerated my opponent's position. I understand that he does not truly believe free trade to be ""deadly."" I will refute his other claims pertaining to assumptions and conflation later in this round. My opponent states that I have made an exaggeration about the extent of wage reduction because of trade with China. Excuse me. However, my point still stands, free trade will cause neither income annihilation nor wage reduction. Contrary to my opponent's allegation's, the US can both encourage economic growth and free trade at the same time. As I have already shown, our societal values will not necessarily change simply because China commits unfair practices and we trade with China. My opponent has asserted that there is a difference between a job that is closely associated with trade from China, and a job that depends on trade with China. Beyond this, though, he does not make any real distinctions between the two. Let's look at it this way. If there are two businesses in a small town, and they are said to be closely associated with one another (that is, the success of one is linked to the success of the other and vice versa), the two establishments clearly depend on one another. The same is true of the millions of American jobs that are closely associated to trade with China. They depend on this trade. My opponent next brings up the idea that trade with China has cost the US 2 million jobs. he specifically targets outsourcing techniques, the process of moving American jobs overseas. Though I agree that this may be true, the statistic he references here is a gross statistic, not a net figure. This mean that he is not accounting for the number of jobs that have been created by the economic growth that this trade has encouraged. If we look to a 2005 study by the economic forecasting company Global Insight, we can see that, """"[Outsourcing] lowers costs, frees domestic resources to pursue other productive ends . . . and increases labor productivity . . . These benefits flow through to lower prices, lower interest rates, and higher spending throughout the economy. . . . Increased economic activity creates a wide range of new jobs . . . over time, the U.S. economy operates more efficiently, [produces more], creates more than twice the number of jobs than are displaced, and increases the average real wage"" [1]. This same study found that, for example, outsourcing had created more than 257,000 net new American jobs in 2005 alone. Obviously, this movement of jobs only encourages economic growth and in the long term is highly beneficial. Again, excuse me if I misrepresented my opponent's position. My opponent seems to recognize that trade is mutually beneficial, but he then goes on to say that it has been proven not to be. I am somewhat confused by this contradiction. he then cites the Opium Wars and the Slave trade, stating that they are examples of when free trade has failed. However, the Opium Wars occurred because Britain was smuggling opium past Chinese borders, despite Chinese restrictions on drugs. This shows that restrictions and tariffs cause trade conflict. In the example of the Slave Trade, Europeans and Americans forced Africans into slavery. China is doing nothing that serious to America, so this example should be disregarded. Furthermore, trade restrictions could hardly have prevented slavery. My opponent also claims that I simply repeat the assertion that trade is mutually beneficial. I would like to point out that I had several sources to back this up; it is in no way an empty claim. Even if China has committed unfair labor practices, these would not have made that country rich on their own. China needed one more ingredient to become wealthy: trade with the US. Without trade, China would still be poor and underdeveloped, ad have an enormous incentive to continue using unfair policies. Now that free trade has allowed for Chinese growth, China can afford to level the playing field. My opponent next moves away from economic impacts and asserts that free trade, because it has allowed China to grow, will elevate China to the status of a superpower, and allow China to spread oppression. However, as China grows, it will be able to integrate itself into the global capitalist system, and will have a motive to decrease oppression and allow justice to reign. A developed China will be a free China. We are already starting to see this in Chinese trade practices. Free trade is important not only to the US economy, but to the entire world.

Batting Average-Ruth .342, Gehrig .340  
Total bases-Ruth 375, Gehrig 379  
SO%(SO/plate appearances)- Ruth 13%, Gehrig 8.2%  
Runs created-Ruth 176, Gehrig 167  
Ruth and Gehrig played the in same years as team mates. As you can see their stats are similar. So Ruth at the time was not dominating the game.  
  
Ruth's numbers were not so dominant that they are the greatest. The year he set the record of 60 HR in a season, Lou Gehrig hit 47 HR. Gehrig outhit Ruth (.373 to .356) and almost matched him in on-base percentage (.474 to .486), and slugging (.765 to .772). Gehrig led in extra base hits (117 to 97), total bases (447 to 417), and RBIs (175 to 164). Gehrig led the league in doubles, was second in triples, second in home runs, second in hits, and third in batting average. Ruth set records but many of them have been broken.

My opponent says ""Babe was always personable and friendly with others"", but he did many inappropriate and irresponsible things during his career.  
-He ate and drank to excess. Ruth often frequented prostitutes.  
-Fought fans during games.  
-He broke his toe after kicking a bench due to being walked.  
-He constantly argued with umpires/challenged them to fights.  
-Punched an umpire after walking a hitter in four pitches. Also threw dirt in another umpires face for calling him out.  
-feigned exhaustion or a sore arm to avoid pitching, wanting to hit.  
-Quit team because he wanted to hit more.  
-Refused team rules on curfew.  
-""I didn't mean to hit the umpire with the dirt, but I did mean to hit that bastard in the stands""

Many American jobs exist solely because of this trade. A study by Morgan-Stanley found in 2007 that, ""...four to eight million American jobs are closely associated with trade with China... Chinese exports have saved American consumers $600 billion over the past decade and nearly $100 billion alone in 2004..."" [1].

However, we must disregard the current policy positions of companies, and look to the underlying factors that have allowed China to become as wealthy as it is today.

I didn't do any elaborate calculations. Case for ID: My case for ID is a case against evolution. ID is currently the only alternative to evolution with any real support.

3d. In order for living things to be able to get energy from the sun, they must have some form of photosynthesis. But there is no way in which photosynthesis could develop without already having energy to develop it with. There is therefore no way in which photosynthesis could evolve.  
  
3e. Information not rising is simpler than information rising, so you have the burden of proof.  
-Bacterial mutations do not necessarily create new information. They only modify or rearrange existing information.

Chile First off I never said we helped set up a dictatorship, so I am confused as to what my opponent is talking about? Also, my opponent's own source works against him. Let me post some experts from it. CIA actively supported the military Junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency. In fact, many CIA officers shared broader US reservations about Pinochet's single-minded pursuit of power. Evidence s that the government had not supported Pinochet's Rise of Power, and actually discouraged it IE reservations. In the 1960s and the early 1970s, as part of the US Government policy to try to influence events in Chile, the CIA undertook specific covert action projects in Chile. Those hereby acknowledged are described below. The overwhelming objective--firmly rooted in the policy of the period--was to discredit Marxist-leaning political leaders, especially Dr. Salvador Allende, and to strengthen and encourage their civilian and military opponents to prevent them from assuming power. These actions, as stated by Lannans source, were to prevent a dictatorship from growing. Kyrgyzstan The things that my opponent lists as ""bad"" intervention, are false. ""rationing water"" for example. We were giving water to a country that was already lacking it. They wouldn't have had the water had we not been there to give it to them. We ration it so we can distribute it equally among them. Also my opponents claim of us ""ousting"" a leader because he is Muslim, is false, and not backed up by any source, meaning we must drop this point. Middle East We didn't ""help cause 9/11"" by funding them. You realize that 9/11 was caused by two terrorists driving a plane right? This required no more resources than two human beings with access to an airplane to be able to take over these flights. Any of our support towards Al-Queda, had nothing to do with 9/11. Terrorists made a choice, and by that choice, Americans suffered. We didn't cause this by trying to help out other countries. Rockets Arguments Argument 1: Dropped. Argument 2: U.S's protecting the value of it's citizens, why not others? How do we hurt their citizens? My opponent fails to explain this. Human Rights meets the definition that Lannan provided in R1. The basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are considered to be entitled, often held to include the rights to life, liberty, equality, and a fair trial, freedom from slavery and torture, and freedom of thought and expression. (3) This means, by my opponents own argument, that all humans are defined by the same rights. By protecting these rights, they aren't different from our own rights at all. Argument 3: Dropped.

That information in the source, is readily available on other websites, meaning the information still holds true. What my opponent should have done if he wanted to attack my sources, would be to point out something within them that is wrong or flawed.

In fact all humans could be called, ""just a bunch of cells"" for that is what we are made up of. I'm not sure what definition of parasite you are using but it's certainly not a technical one. A parasite is an organism that lives on or in another organism of another species(1). An unborn baby or fetus is dependent on the mother for the first stages of life, just as any other mammal. To be technical a fetus is a mammal not a parasite. The government is not ""forcing"" anything upon the woman. Prolife does not take away a woman's choice to not have a baby. The woman has full freedom over her sexual behavior. She has freedom to choose whether or not she has a baby before conception. Prolife promotes responsibility for the choices the mother has already made and protects the human life she is now responsible for. You said: ""yet if you do believe that a fetus is a human...""(emphasis added) It's not a matter of believe, it's a matter of scientific fact(2). I mentioned this in my opening case. You cannot claim that an unborn is not human because it is less developed. Is an adult more human than a baby? Of course not! That's discriminatory. Why should it be any different for an unborn baby? You said you are against abortion after 6 months. Why should a baby of 6 months be more valuable then that of 5 or of 1 day? Did you know that at 4 months a baby has developed reflexes and can even suck their thumb?(3) Did you know that by the 8th week a baby can feel pain?(4) If an organism can feel pain it must have a level of self-awareness. But neither of these facts make the fetus any more or less ""human"". To discriminate against a living human being because of their age or physical development is not right. Why should it be okay inside the womb they are most vulnerable? You said: ""nor does the fetus have the right to use another humans organs without his/her permission"" The fetus did not invade the mother or choose to live inside her. These choices were made by the mother. The mother chose to have sex at the right time of the month, without proper contraception. The mother chose to create life, not the child. Why should the human life who was created by the choices of the mother then be neglected and killed? The choices of the mother are permission enough. It's her very own doing! You said: ""Childbirth is the 6th leading cause, causing over 200,000 deaths in 2013..."" Yes, but abortion has killed even more lives!

You said: ""..putting a baby up for adoption costs a lot more money than an abortion, usually around 3,500$-7,000$"" Adoption can certainly be expensive, but whether it's a viable solution does not build a case that abortion is not murder. Many times aborting the unborn baby would make life easier for the mother, this does not change whether abortion kills an innocent life and is therefore murder. We need to support mothers in difficult situations from unplanned pregnancies. In a recent letter to my federal member of parliament, I raised the issue of more support for our single mums.

It makes it difficult for voters and goes beyond the rules of the debate. Arguments not answered 1) Was the sample from the WTC chemical signature analysis? I am not lying, regarding the resignation of Prof Pileni. The resignation was due to the fact that the manuscript was published without permission. (1) This is the same newspaper source cited in the first round and my opponent keeps denying. Here is a translation to help the voters and my opponent. """" I resign as the editor in chief,"" was the succinct answer in an email to videnskab.dk. Printed without permission A phone call reveals that the chief Marie-Paule Pileni never been informed that the article would be published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal, which is published by journal juggernaut Bentham Science Publishers. ""They have printed the article without my authorization else, so when you wrote to me, I had no idea that the article was published. I can not accept, and therefore I have written to Bentham that I resign from all activities with them, ""says Marie-Paule Pileni. "" My opponent has conceded the chain of custody point. The fact that it is extreme circumstances is not a reason to doubt the validity of the chain of custody argument. Pro also states nano thermite can only be made in one or two laboratories in the world. This is false as any nano-lab anywhere in the world can produce nano thermite as can be seen in the publication history of nano-thermite manuscripts. Please do a simple Google scholar search for nano thermite. Con rightfully points out the difference between the grey and red layers. However, this casts in doubt as to what was been analyzed in the studies and whether the compositions of iron and aluminum calculated using EDS are correct. The correct method would have been to separate the layers, then purify them and then analyze them independent of each other. This is a failure of the experimentalists and casts massive doubt on the results. Regarding the use of EDS, EDS is a surface measurement and as such does not measure the total content of the sample. As such it is usually used only for preliminary analysis, structural analysis and not complete elemental analysis. This is due to analysis peaks overlapping, scattering of electrons and adsorption of electrons by the sample.(2,3) These two reasons are why I doubt the ratios found as stated in my round 2 argument. Pro has said Figure 14s extra peaks are due to surface contamination. This does not explain why this similar contamination was not found on the other samples in figure 7. Please elaborate further as this is from the same sample set and again casts huge doubt on the analysis employed. The fact that Al and Si are inherent in minerals on earth and not thermite manufactured in the lab proves that this material could be natural and not manufactured in a lab. To counter this Pro cam up with the following argument. ""Con must come up with a reaction that reduces iron(III) oxide forming iron spheres that does not include a thermitic reaction. "" Pro maybe does not understand that iron oxide can be easily reduced to multiple forms in multiple ways, even spheres.(4-6) The fact that spheres formed is irrelevant as this does not prove thermite, this only proves the reduction of iron.

This is true, but not a point under contention.

The second is simply a rehash of the above discussion, that the descriptor of an egg, whether it is a chicken egg or a hybrid junglefowl egg, is defined by parentage, not genetics.

Con did not dispute that the definition of an egg depends on parentage not genetics, thus a chicken egg can only exist when a chicken has laid it, thus the chicken comes first.  
  
Con did not use in-line citations and so it is impossible to ascertain which of his links support which of his arguments. Please vote sources for Pro.",Entertainment,1,The-chicken-comes-before-the-egg/1/,63892

Here is the definition of concern we will be following: Concern: to make (someone) worried : to cause concern for (someone) In the comments, my opponent said this: ""Population as a broad subject is not a concern. But you may have well as already won if you just need to prove that population has concerned people before. Guess I fell for this trap. Ill give it my best."" We both agree that if I prove that population is a concern to someone, I win. It wasn't really a trap, but rather what I believe. That being said, on to the arguments! Humans are concerned by population: Upon the fact that my opponent and I agree with the same terms, I will start out by showing you that at least one person is concerned by the population problem. On our very own site, an opionion question asked if any think that overpopulation is a global crisis. [2]. 81% responded by saying yes, and explaining why it concerns them. Therefoe, my point that at least one human is concerned by population is proved. This is a rather weak starting point, but it actually does prove what the resolution says. I will now go on to say why humans should be concerned by this, rather than who is concerned by this. Why we should be concerned: For this standpoint, I will turn to environmental issues. As we all know, most things in life are limited. And recources and environment are one of them. Without trees or food or water, the human race, nor any other animal, would ever be able to survive. The human race is slowly depriving our planet of natural resources. We are putting a ton of carbon dioxide out there, and it is only going to get worse as the population increases. Studies show that the carbon levels have risen 32% from 1750 to today, with 60% taking place in the 1960's-current time [3]. Carbon makes the air very unhealthy and almost unbreathable. As for resources, it is freakin' scary. The U.S contributes to almost 40% of all resource depletions. If everyone lived like a normal American, we would need FIVE EARTHS [4] to support the population. And since we are trying to give people better homes to live in, the amount of people living like an American will go up by a lot. Also, there are 310 million people in the U.S compared to just 90 million a century ago [5]. That is about a 3.2x increase over a century and is probably only going to get higher. So there is why you should be concerned. The future looks bleak... In the future, the population will rise. Projections about the population in the future are mind-boggiling. In 2050, we will have about 9 BILLION people occupying the earth [6]. In just 35 years, our population will rise about two billion people. We are already pushing Earth past its tipping point. Furthermore, the U.N projects above 10 billion people in 2062 [8].

933,"Obviously this is a very large area to debate but I'll do my best to find a suitable start. I'm sure con won't mind if I start my debate in this round. The most obvious place to start I suppose is with the current recession we're in and the total collapse of the western economy. This will be my first premise. It creates a system in which hard working people are extremely likely to fail in the business world--my second premise. Capitalism is a relatively new thing. It has only existed since the industrial revolution began c.1800. This is my third premise. It causes war, destuction and crime--my fourth premise. I'll do my best to stick to these main points and in the order as above. P1) In September of 2008 the global markets crashed with, as we all know, disastrous consequences. But this was not an isolated event caused by a couple of gung-ho, irresponsible bankers who lost control temporarily. There have been dozens of recessions over the last twohundred years, arguably the most notorious in America being the wall street crash of the late 1920s and the recession in the 1980s being the most notorious in Britain. So in that sence the current world leaders ought to bare no blame. In the current system recessions are clearly inevitable. But, I'm sure you'll agree, a system that hosts a recession every few years isn't a system that works. Now; to cure a recession you need to get the banks trading again and to do this the banks need money. You must ask yourself: where will the money come from? The only two European countries that are barely keeping there heads above the water are France and Germany but even they can't afford to lend much more money. In south America you have countries that have never done well to sustain an economy, Mexico and Canada can't afford too loan money and the USA is getting closer to the condition that Greece, Ireland and Portugal are in every day. So want about Asia? Japan was driven back into recession by the nuclear disaster in Fukoshima south Korea has no money to give and china is already owed billions of dollars by the USA. African and middle eastern countries have no real economy as their best assets are already owned by the west. So unless the matins lend us a couple of trillion dollars these recessions are going to carry on happening every few decades. But let's ask ourselves where the money is. Money doesn't just disappear overnight. What's happened is the money is in the hands of a few billionaires who have continued to get richer despite the recession. You may argue that these enourmous anounts of money are necessary to create an incentive for production, that, for example, people would no longer develop technology if they werent treated as better, more elite people for it. But I ask you: would you decide to no longer work or invent things if you weren't paid extortionate amounts of money to do so? Would you go back to living in the medieval ages just because you couldn't have a swimming pool in your house? Our curiosity, imagination and injenuity extends back to times far before the invention of capitalism, back, even, to times before money was invented. No-one paid the cave men to paint. No-one paid for the invention of fire or the Cerne Abbis Giant in Cornwall or the neolithic tombs of the British Isles. or the numerous other feates of human capability throughout history and the world. Money is about greed, not motivation. P2)Despite the fact that I got a bit off course in my first premise I've lead myself neatly into my second premise. Not only would I say that capitalism is not an incentive for creativity - I would go as far as to say it stunts creativity. Why are there so few Bill Gates? Surely there are more people than that with the knowledge to create a business. Well, there are. The problem is people can't afford to create their own products, literature, art etc. This makes sense. For more billionaires to be created current billionaires would have to sacrifice money. Not something they'd be too keen on, is it? So, by definition not every-one can succeed. P3)I've already explained that capitalism is a new thing and isn't peoples incentive to invent and be productive, so I won't elaborate further on that point. P4)As I've already explained: not every-one can succeed in a capitalist society. So if, like at the moment, hundreds of thousands of people across the world find themselves unemployed--what are their options? They are offered social security; a small amount of money designed to merely keep people alive. But this simply isn't good enough for people who are capable of work and want to work. Some people think its their fault theyre unemployed and think that they must deal with the consequences and suffer. Others, though find themselves alienated from the system and gang culture increases. People who could be working end up vandalising and terrorising communities. The government plays this to their advantage by putting people into the prison system and hence the public think that crime is being fought. But the only long term solution to crime is to end unemployment--which capitalism can't do. My final premise is war. Capitalism has always started wars. Did Sadam Hussein posses weapons of mass destruction? No. He had oil. America needs oil--it's worth billions of dollars to them every year. But they couldnt stop at Iraq. They claimed that terrorism was Americas greatest threat. So they had to carry on fighting terrorism or face the consequences for starting a war under false pretensions. They invaded Afghanistan and carried on killing innocent civilians whilst getting the odd radical as-well. Now they want to invade Iran. And what are they accusing Iran of? The ability to create weapons of mass distruction of course. And who owns enough weapons of mass distraction to destroy the world several times over? Britain and America, of course.",1,LogicalThinker,"
  
Obviously this is a very large area to debate but I'll do my best to find a suitable start. I'm sure con won't mind if I start my debate in this round.  
ï¿½ The most obvious place to start I suppose is with the current recession we're in and the total collapse of the western economy. This will be my first premise.  
ï¿½ It creates a system in which hard working people are extremely likely to fail in the business world--my second premise.  
ï¿½ Capitalism is a relatively new thing. It has only existed since the industrial revolution began c.1800. This is my third premise.  
ï¿½ It causes war, destuction and crime--my fourth premise. I'll do my best to stick to these main points and in the order as above.  
P1) In September of 2008 the global markets crashed with, as we all know, disastrous consequences. But this was not an isolated event caused by a couple of gung-ho, irresponsible bankers who lost control temporarily. There have been dozens of recessions over the last twohundred years, arguably the most notorious in America being the wall street crash of the late 1920s and the recession in the 1980s being the most notorious in Britain. So in that sence the current world leaders ought to bare no blame. In the current system recessions are clearly inevitable. But, I'm sure you'll agree, a system that hosts a recession every few years isn't a system that works.  
Now; to cure a recession you need to get the banks trading again and to do this the banks need money. You must ask yourself: where will the money come from? The only two European countries that are barely keeping there heads above the water are France and Germany but even they can't afford to lend much more money.

This is true, therefore she has proven one thing. In my response, I wrote, ""You can not prove with 100 percent certainty that I can not prove with 100% certainty that you are not a monkey."" This is also true. Therefore, I have also proven one thing. In R2, Pro writes that I have failed to provide an argument for her to refute. However, she has not proven that this is true. I can prove that it's not true by noting I did indeed make a statement in the previous round, and in order to refute that statement she would have to prove it untrue. Therefore, since she could have proven my contention wrong, I did indeed provide an argument. Thus, Pro's assertion that I did not provide an argument is false; she has not (can not) prove it. Next, Pro says that I have not taken this debate seriously. You'll notice that Pro did not (can not) prove that either.

I got into an argument with my teacher today over whether or not I should have to do the work she assigned. She gave me a detention because she ""didn't like hearing me complain."" Did we argue? Yes. Was it reasonable to give me a detention to avoid confronting the truth? No.  
Perhaps you view it the other way, in that I was at fault. In that case, would it have been logical for me to argue with the teacher? Hardly.  
  
In most arguments, there is one (or more) sides arguing without logic or factual evidence. Do we still classify it as arguing? We certainly do. Does PRO propose changing the way the word 'argument' is used so that he can win this debate?  
  
---  
  
My opponent does give a definition of 'argument.' I think it's silly to let this debate be resolved on a single definition, particularly when the debate is about what the definition of 'argument' is. Regardless, if you do wish to vote on which side better adheres to the provided definition, you still vote CON.  
  
""Argument: a STATEMENT, reason, or fact for or against a point""

941,"I thank my opponent for his response. 1. My opponent's statement that I cannot separate Lady Gaga from her music is factually incorrect and/or simply misstated. I am not trying to separate her from her music at all. The point of this debate, again, was to illustrate the fact that her lyrics and music are causing a negative impact on not only the music industry, but on the music community itself. I am CONJOINING her and her music, not separating her from it at all. I view her music as the problem in this debate and the source of the argument, not as an ignorant thing that is just to be thrown to the side. When you compare the music Lady GaGa produces to the actions she performs, it is if you are looking at two different people: on the one hand, there is a woman who is out speaking her mind for what she believes in in a good and honest way (her actions). However, when you listen to her music and lyrics, you see a person who seems bent on drinking, engaging in unsafe sexual actions with the first thing that moves (Just Dance), stalking (Paparazzi), lying masochism about her sexuality (Poker face), and masochism (Bad Romance, Telephone). And who hears all of this unsavory behavior? Anyone willing to listen. 2. My opponent mentions the 'imagery' Gaga creates. Now, exactly, what imagery would this be? Let us examine said video (located at the top right, top video): From the opening minute, we see a woman who is literally lying prone on the street being photographed by the 'Paparazzi' that she sings about. Then, said woman is put in a wheelchair, and instead of being taken to a place like a hospital, is wheeled into a lobby, and promptly stripped down to her underwear. Constantly, there are images of her lying in what appears to be a stripper-esc outfit on a couch in seductive positions. As these images flash by at a high rate of speed, she continues to tell us how she will stalk someone until they 'love her', though I see and feel no love in these images. Murder scenes are then constantly portrayed as she starts referencing cigarettes. The rest of the video is summed up by Gaga being 'felt up' by others, more seductive positions and weird imagery, more lyrics about stalking, and it culminates in a fake 9-1-1 call with Gaga saying she just killed her boyfriend. 3. The third main point my opponent makes is that since all of this is okay and 'accepted by society' and that 'everyone is doing it', it is not okay for me to focus on Gaga alone. I thought we were DEBATING about Lady GaGa? The purpose of this debate is not, never was, and never will be to argue about anyone or anything but the impact of LADY GAGA on the music industry. Not Ke$ha. Not Britney Spears. Lady Gaga and Lady Gaga alone. Just because everyone else is doing it doesn't make it right and I intend to continue to show that Gaga's music and antics are both counter-productive, poisonous and, overall, damaging. Also, thank you for conceding the point that Lady Gaga is on the same level as all of these people that can also be considered damaging influences via their lyrics and songs. 4. My opponent states that an 8 year old is mentally developed enough to understand the song, and that ""...Regardless, it would provide for a good learning opportunity and a chance for the parent to explain why alcohol is wrong and why you need to have safe sex, why drugs are bad and so on..."" I'd assume that this child would be getting these teachings from either their parent or someone besides Lady Gaga, correct? Because when you listen to her music, it seems as if all of these things are not just accepted; they are commonplace. I believe that the person who needs to be taught those values are not the theoretical eight year old: the person who needs to learn those potentially life-saving values are Lady GaGa herself, and her music preaches just the opposite. Now, after everything that has just been said, the problem still remains: what is the message at the heart of the song? What is the message in her lyrics? Where is the notion that everything is NOT okay with this? Well, I can tell you one news network who wasn't too pleased with Ms. Lady Gaga: Fox (video below 'Paparazzi' vid, top right). The news report suggests that the video was ""Pushing TWISTED SEXUAL FANTASIES on YOUNG CHILDREN"". Sound familiar? There seems to be a recurring trend in Gaga's lyrics: sex, drugs, and good old fashioned violence. The sex part is in literally every song (I'll reinforce this point later; I hate this character limit), the drugs (mostly alcohol) are evident in, again, mostly every song (Also, Gaga's 'Telephone' vid was reportedly banned from MTV for the same reasons I iterate here). The violence portion is more in the videos, with the killing of the boyfriend and what-not. And as you can see from the most recent advancements in technology and availability of music, it is quite easy for young children to gain access to this music, absorb its information again AND again AND again, and eventually take hold of the misconception that, as Gaga says 'Everything's fine. Just Dance.', when in the real world, everything is far from fine. They don't understand that alcohol, exposing yourself to anyone, mindless sex, death, stalking, and many many other things are NOT okay. They shouldn't even be dealing with those things at such an age! But there the songs are: ready to take children in their grip and teach them everything they DIDN'T need to know. And who lets, no, CAUSES these things to happen? Lady Gaga and her 'music'. I await my opponent's response. <URL>... <URL>...",1,Railsguardian,"

948,"I wish to thank Con for this debate. It is one that I have never before considered and will do my best to establish. Argument What do we mean by omnipotent. By saying that God is omnipotent means that he has the power to implement whatever he desires. If god was not omnipotent that would mean that there is something that He could wish to do that He would be incapable of. If He could not do something, then He cannot be by definition perfect. If God is imperfect then He cannot be omniscient, because He cannot know the effects of something that He could not do. If God is not omniscient and omnipotent, then He is not necessarily unchangeable. And if God can change then He cannot have the attributes of perfection, because only perfection cannot be improved upon. Thus, if God is not perfect then he cannot contain the various attributes of perfection such as perfect love or perfect justice. If God is not perfect love nor able to exercise perfect justice, then such things do not actually exist because it then becomes conceivable that we, his creations, could theoretically be more loving or more just than God. If this were true then you arrive at a paradox. We have love and justice because we are made in the image of God. If God's love and justice are flawed then so is our own love and justice. Our attributes, instead of being a reflection of the perfect love and justice of God, would only be a reflection of the imperfect. If our attributes are a reflection of the imperfect then we cannot know if there is true love or justice because what we receive from the one who created us are of a finite, and thus possibly flawed, nature. This makes any ""love"" to be suspect, and makes any application of justice immoral because they are both based on a flawed or incomplete attributes to begin with. Finally an ""imperfect God"" cannot exist in eternity. A finite God would ultimately be an evil God. If God is not perfect and infinite, then God is not completely self sufficient. This is because God would then have limits. Imagine having a library of 10 books that you love. Now you are locked in the library for a day. Not a problem. You might read 1 book, maybe 2 if you read fast. Now imagine being stuck there for a week, a year, a century, a millennia. You would become would come to hate those books instead of loving those books. That is because you, existing as a being of potential, have reached a limit. This would happen to any intelligent being of potential once their potential has exhausted their limits. In this sense God would not be the perfect God of the Bible, but rather like the imperfect gods of the Greeks and Romans. Ultimately, this would lead to the logical conclusion that God is evil. If God is not perfect, it is immoral for Him to send anyone to hell, because he cannot be assured that His justice is perfect. So let's say that God lets everyone into heaven. Even then God would have to be acknowledged as evil. This is because after a certain period of time in his presence we would cease to be satisfied. Ultimately, like in the library example, we would become bored with eternity, because our potential would never be fully realized. For God to create people knowing that there is no choice for them but to be subjected to an eternity of torment, through no fault of their own, is the very opposite of love and justice. As such God cannot be a finite being of potential, but must be one of the infinite or the ""actual"". If God is omnipotent, it is possible for Him to be omniscient and omnipresent. If these are true, then the remainder of His attributes will also be perfect in nature and thus His love and justice would be perfect. His infinite nature would never be exhausted and would lead to eternal joy for those who are in His presence. Conclusion I have shown the necessity for God to be infinitely powerful in order for him to be considered God. For, if he is not without limits, all of creation would ultimately be evil otherwise.",1,Geogeer,"
  
  I wish to thank Con for this debate. It is one that I have never before considered and will do my best to establish.  Argument  What do we mean by omnipotent. By saying that God is omnipotent means that he has the power to implement whatever he desires. If god was not omnipotent that would mean that there is something that He could wish to do that He would be incapable of. If He could not do something, then He cannot be by definition perfect.   If God is imperfect then He cannot be omniscient, because He cannot know the effects of something that He could not do. If God is not omniscient and omnipotent, then He is not necessarily unchangeable. And if God can change then He cannot have the attributes of perfection, because only perfection cannot be improved upon.   Thus, if God is not perfect then he cannot contain the various attributes of perfection such as perfect love or perfect justice. If God is not perfect love nor able to exercise perfect justice, then such things do not actually exist because it then becomes conceivable that we, his creations, could theoretically be more loving or more just than God. If this were true then you arrive at a paradox. We have love and justice because we are made in the image of God. If God's love and justice are flawed then so is our own love and justice. Our attributes, instead of being a reflection of the perfect love and justice of God, would only be a reflection of the imperfect.

plus coke makes every one happy. it is good to just sit back relax and have a coke. same goes with dr. pepper, but coke is just the essence of 'cool'

963,"Being home-schooled myself and planning to attend engineering school, I think that I am in a good position to dispel the common misconceptions regarding homeschooling, as well as give some good positive reasons why home-schooling may be better than public schooling. My opponent has given three reasons why public schooling is better than home-schooling, so before I get into my positive reasons for home-schooling, I shall deal with her arguments. Curriculum opportunities My opponent asserts that there are usually more curriculum opportunities in public schooling than in home-schooling. However, such claims are unfounded, and unreferenced. Many home-schoolers also participate in online classes, run by private companies. For example, (not to toot my own horn) I have been able to study Latin for 8 years, which involved translating Caesar's Gallic Wars, as well as Cicero's First and Third Orations against Catiline, and his First Oration against Verres. (1) Furthermore, I have been able to study different coures on traditional logic, (2) as well as philosophy. While not every home-schooler may take advantage of these opportunities, the opportunities are still present. The amount of different courses available to home-schoolers through the internet is immense. This suffices to demonstrate that Pro's assertions are unfounded-the internet has allowed for almost any subject a student desires to learn about. Working with others Once again, Pro's arguments fail. Some home-schoolers participate in group home-school classes, where they are able to interact with each other. Furthermore, how to interact with other people can be easily learned through any sort of part-time job, or summer job. It is not an essential part of an education to teach the student how to interact with others. Social skills Home-schoolers being socially inept is nothing more than a myth. Home-schoolers often participate in home-school group events. This can range from anywhere to Church meetings to a formal dance. At events such as these, home-schoolers are given opportunities to learn social skills, and how to interact with others. Arguments in favor of home-schooling Now that I have refuted my opponent's arguments, I shall present some positive reasons why home-schooling may be better than public schooling. 1. Each person is different While public schooling may be better for some, it's also very plausible to accept that home-schooling may be better for others. Someone who is prone to being bullied, or easily distracted by their friends, may find it much easier to learn in a different, quieter atmosphere. So while public schools may be good for some, we should also accept the possibility that home schooling may be better for others. 2. Superior test scores Furthermore, home-schoolers regularly perform better on standardized tests. According to the US Department of Education, the average ACT score for a home-schooler is 22.6 (3) This is 1.5 points higher than the National Average ACT, which is 21.1 (4) Once again, I can personally attest to this fact. Most of my friends who are home schoolers have scored above 25 on their ACT tests. According to educationnews.org: ""Homeschooling statistics show that those who are independently educated [home-schooled] typically score between the 65th and 89th percentile on such exams, while those attending traditional schools average on the 50th percentile."" (5) Conclusion It should be no surprise that the amount of home-schoolers has risen by 75% since 1999 (5). Home-schooling affords all the oppurtunities of public-schooling, results in superior education (as evidenced by the ACT averages), and avoids the negative aspects of public schools, such as bullying and distraction. Thus, it has been established that public schooling is not better than homeschooling, and that homeschooling may even be better. I await Pro's response! Sources: (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>...

At that point, they would stop attacking him, and he could feed some of them chum to make them sick. The other brainwashed citizens will move away, not wanting to get sick. Should Spongebob try to interfere, an enlargened Robo Krabs could prevent Spongebob or Patrick from interfering. Should all else fail and Plankton be trampled, he will not be rendered unconscious.

Plankton can use his ""Mind-controlling Chum buckets"" (from the ""Spongebob Squarepants Movie) to sabotage Patrick into attacking Spongebob. After Spongebob summons Patrick, Plankton, in his larger Robo Krabs, can grab Patrick and force the bucket onto Patrick's head. Under Plankton's control, Patrick would proceed to attack Spongebob, and Spongebob would not be skilled enough to take on both of them at once.

///Therefore, the Windows being the more convenient with a cheaper price doesn't make it quality, which it isn't. So thus I can logically conclude that this is a recession made by my opponent or a miswritten analogy of Windows to Macs.///  
  
I do not believe that this is that hard of a point to understand. My opponent's original contention was that since Macs come with more stuff that they are better. I refuted this by explaining how convenience does not equal quality with the food analogy. Effectively refuting my opponent's point. However my opponent persisted to make the claim that the analogy was directly referencing Macs and Windows PCs. This is incorrect, I say again that the analogy only showed that . He even adds support to my side by stating that Windows PCs are cheaper.

I will drop my point about Keynote and PowerPoint. One specific Mac/Windows program being superior to another Mac/Windows program really has no significant bearing on the resolution of whether or not Macs are superior to Windows PCs. The debate is about the computers as a whole not simply one minor aspect.

Your friend's problem is not the Windows XP operating system's fault. You see, AntiVirus2008XP is a program installed on your computer because of a Trojan Horse virus infection. Here are instructions as to how your friend can correct this problem [5]. Therefore my opponent's contention that these pop-ups are because of the OS is voided.  
~  
  
In conclusion I have refuted all of my opponent's original contentions. My opponent has conceded that the software selection that is usable for Windows OSs is better than Macs and that this is a good thing, and he has not even mentioned the fact that the license agreement for Macintosh prevents you from using the software in the way that you deem fit. I strongly urge a Con vote.

If rehabilitation is an incentive to offend, why would Norway have a lower per capita crime rate than the United States? Furthermore, the majority of what is taught in rehabilitative systems are skills that are designed so when these people get out of prison, they contribute to society.

[2] The skills that are taught in prisons can be learned elsewhere, not only in prison. This is what I was talking about in my incentive to offend argument.

If poorer people are not successful in school, why would they be successful in prison? In prison's, they do not teach you math and science. This point on student loans is completely irrelevant. The main point is that you are rewarding the criminal after he commits a crime instead of punishing him for it. Prison is still punishment. Isolation from the outside world is the punishment. My opponent would rather these people be punished, then go out AND REOFFEND WITH A MORE SERIOUS CRIME rather than for them to offend ONCE, and then help society. He says that public opinion has no place in a justice system, because the United States is a democracy, public opinion always matters. In a democracy, the public votes for what they want and things they don't want will not be likely to get anywhere. This is a completely ridiculous point. First, public opinion does not affect justice at all. Just because the majority of people think a man is guilty DOES NOT MAKE HIM GUILTY. Just because the majority of the population thinks that criminals will always be criminals does not make it so. Just because the majority of the population disagrees with rehabilitation DOES NOT MAKE IT INEFFECTIVE. Secondly, the public does not vote on every single aspect of life, so that is invalid. This shows that even after rehabilitation, not many people are willing to accept criminals. After checking my opponent's source, it says LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION. Source 3 of R2 merely states "" What's the point of rehabilitation if society won't forgive and forget? As Britain debates the fate of Philip Lawrence's killer, Peter Stanford argues that anyone can turn their life around - with the right help. And one ex-offender tells his story ."" Nowhere in that is public opinion even mentioned with stats, plus this was about Britain, not the United States so it is COMPLETELY irrelevant. Furthermore, the source even goes on to support rehabilitation. As far as I know, you can't have a negative recidivism rate, so these numbers cannot go together. The number is not negative. It is very simple: 2/3rds of people will reoffend. After rehabilitation, reoffending rates fell by 83%. That means instead of 66% of criminals reoffending, it is more like 12% of criminals reoffending. Also, the Pro's evidence from Norway may sound nice, but they have a very different society from us. There are so many other variables that you cannot say that rehabilitation is the cause of their low crime rate. Rehabilitation is completely the cause of their low crime rate. I have proven that rehab reduces repeat offenses and turns criminals into working members of society. Both of these lead to a lower crime rate. Deterrence has been proven to stop 15 crimes for each criminal locked up, so taking away deterrence would increase the crime rate 15X. This stat is completely bogus. If the United States has a reported crime rate of 11 877 218 crimes [3], meaning that without the deterrence factor we would have 178 158 270 crimes, or roughly 1/3 people being criminals. Furthermore, if this was true we would have a steadily dropping crime rate as we are incarcerating more people, yet as I have shown this is not the case.

However, most protestant religions differ form Catholicism in the same ways. That's it for definitions. Time for some contentions. CONTENTION ONE: Faith leading to obedience to a worldly power One of the main differences between Catholicism and other brands of Christianity is that the Catholics have a Pope. They believe this Pope speaks with divine authority. In this sense, Catholicism turns people into drones willing to follow a master. Remember the Crusades? They happened in large part because people thought the Pope was speaking divine truth. . . when he was sometimes just a corrupt man with corrupt goals. By teaching people that the Pope has divine authority, Catholicism has given a man the right to say ridiculous things and have masses of people follow him without question. Recently he claimed that condoms were one of the main reasons AIDS is so widespread in Africa. He probably didn't even have corrupt motives here, he was just wrong. Under normal circumstances, people would look at that statement and say ""That doesn't make any sense at all."" While many people still did that, many people took what he said as truth simply because he said it. Humans should not be viewed as having divine authority. Such a doctrine is morally negative. CONTENTION TWO: Protestantism was borne of some moral problems with Catholicism Catholicism was built largely on the Bible and other supposedly holy texts, where Protestantism was largely built on the qualms people had with Catholicism. EX: In the Bible, Jesus states that bread and wine are transformed into his flesh and blood in the eucharist. Catholicism takes this literally, but few other forms of Christianity do. Why? Because those other forms of Christianity found the idea of eating your savior's body to be morally repulsive. They're right. Claiming that the bread and wine really turn into flesh and blood of Jesus is not only a lie that doesn't have to be propagated, but it's also morally unsavory. The only form of morality that where eating Jesus' flesh and blood is admirable is a morality based specifically on the Catholic religion. There are no doubt many other moral qualms the protestants had when they split off from Catholicism. CONTENTION THREE: Catholicism is more ritualistic Catholicism has always kept their traditions running strong. Unfortunately, many of these traditions are very ritualistic. Rituals confuse people and stop people from thinking critically about issues - certainly not morally admirable. Closely related to the ritualistic nature of Catholicism is the ""saints."" In Catholicism, saints are very important - in fact, most devout Catholics pray to certain saints.

Conclusion:  
My opponent has given no practical benefits for same-sex marriages. She has failed to show that homosexuals are not receiving equal rights. She finds no moral compunction in unilaterally trumping the popular vote of US citizens and permitting same-sex marriages – this is against the ideals of our nation. She calls homosexuality innate without proving it as such. She apparently lays claim to an unspecified moral objective that is both binding and obligatory. She calls me foolish and ignorant – and to this I can only chuckle.  
  
I look forward to my opponent's response

978,"First of all, let me thank Pro for this open invitation and agree with Pro that not only is this a very intriguing topic but that I myself would love for it to be the case. Sadly the scientific basis for this is rather lacking, however I might personally feel about it. Pro has referred to two different phenomena in making the case for this idea. The first, biophotons, refers simply to the idea that the human body emits light. Cellular metabolism releases energy - this energy can disperse as heat or in the form of 'packets' known as photons of light. It has been postulated that biophotons are involved in cellular communication. Not only is this in contention, but as Pro has already stated, humans cannot sense the photons involved in human biophotonics. I must further add that as far as is currently known, humans also do not have the capacity to directly affect cellular metabolism and thus do not have the ability to control their own biophotonics by anything other than the most basic and crude means (by for example working out or bludgeoning themselves to cause trauma). ( <URL>... ). Separate to this, the human body has a measurable magnetic field that is nothing to do with the extremely faint ferromagnetic properties of our blood - our nervous system produces current, therefore a field is generated. That does interact with the global magnetic field, but the general scientific consensus is that the external global field has no measurable effect on us, or our behaviour. We do possess the genetic hardware to sense magnetic fields, but crucially for some reason our species doesn't activate it ( <URL>... ) ( <URL>... ). However, even if activated the consensus is that it works in animals with the sense by making the normal vision appear lighter or darker depending on which way they turn.

First of all, let me thank Pro for this open invitation and agree with Pro that not only is this a very intriguing topic but that I myself would love for it to be the case. Sadly the scientific basis for this is rather lacking, however I might personally feel about it.  
  
Pro has referred to two different phenomena in making the case for this idea. The first, biophotons, refers simply to the idea that the human body emits light. Cellular metabolism releases energy - this energy can disperse as heat or in the form of 'packets' known as photons of light. It has been postulated that biophotons are involved in cellular communication. Not only is this in contention, but as Pro has already stated, humans cannot sense the photons involved in human biophotonics. I must further add that as far as is currently known, humans also do not have the capacity to directly affect cellular metabolism and thus do not have the ability to control their own biophotonics by anything other than the most basic and crude means (by for example working out or bludgeoning themselves to cause trauma). (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  ).  
  
Separate to this, the human body has a measurable magnetic field that is nothing to do with the extremely faint ferromagnetic properties of our blood - our nervous system produces current, therefore a field is generated. That does interact with the global magnetic field, but the general scientific consensus is that the external global field has no measurable effect on us, or our behaviour. We do possess the genetic hardware to sense magnetic fields, but crucially for some reason our species doesn't activate it (  http://www.newscientist.com...  ) (  http://www.indianexpress.com...  ). However, even if activated the consensus is that it works in animals with the sense by making the normal vision appear lighter or darker depending on which way they turn. This in no way implies that they can sense the small local fluctuations of magnetic field.  
  
Moreover, we lack any capacity to see this ourselves, or a means extend any control over the global field. Perhaps in the future someone might work out how to re-activate this dormant capacity, but it will be a visual and directional sense, and a sense rather than a capacity to alter behaviour. In support of my previous statement, I note that the World Health Organisation states that to the best of it's knowledge through the examination of various studies, low-level magnetic fields do not have any health consequences on humans in either a physiological or psychological capacity (  http://www.who.int...  ).

979,"Good afternoon, I'm delighted to join this debate. Background Checks Let me start my rebuttal by discussing the role of background checks. The so called 40% loophole is very far from the truth. Any Gun Store that participates in a gun show is still operating as a business, and therefore required to conduct the Federally Required Background Check. What people are referring to are gun sales/transfers between private individuals. Does this occur? Of course it does. Every minute of every day someone is purchasing/transferring/gifting a firearm from someone without a background check. The response to this ""problem"" is the so called Universal Background Check. The problem with this solution is, how could it possibly be enforced? A gun store is easy because they must register with the government in order to operate as a business. The Government knows where it is, what paperwork that must kept for auditing, employee background checks, etc. A gun show would be easy as well because they advertise for months the location. Law enforcement could easily oversee such an event. But what about between private individuals? Every minute of every day people manufacture, transport, sell, and consume illegal narcotics despite both State and Federal Laws. How would laws on the transfer of firearms be any different? Since it cannot be enforced it would be a waste of taxpayer time and money to create the law, and a waste on law enforcement to enforce it. But then again, waste has never been a concern for the government ;) 90% of Americans want background checks! This will be more of my critical thinking than one of absolute fact. Whenever I hear 90% of Americans want background checks, several things go through my mind. 1) Was all of America polled? - There are over 180 million registered voters in the US. Each poll taken have an average of <PHONE> responses. 2) Where was the poll? - It's extremely difficult to find truly neutral ground to conduct a poll. A poll on MSNBC will have a different outcome than one created by FOX. 3) When was the last time 90% of Americans agreed on ANYTHING? - There is no question that the US is more divided now than at any other time since the Civil War. To claim that 90% of Americans agree on something, especially something as controversial as gun control, is very suspicious to me. Why can't we be like the UK? It's true, the UK/Japan/Australia/ETC have lower gun violence/gun death rates than the US. Did they achieve this by enacting Universal Background checks? No. Did they achieve this by banning ""Assault"" weapons? No. Did they achieve this by limiting the number of firearms any single individual can own? No. They achieved it by banning ALL firearms. A total ban is the only way to have a total reduction in the number of gun deaths and the number of gun crimes. Several prominent activist groups and people have expressed their desire for a total gun ban, but they are just as extreme as the people who demand their right to own a F22. The majority of people in the US do NOT advocate a total firearm ban. So until we have a majority and ban all firearms, we will never be like the UK/Australia/Japan. We register our Cars, why not our Guns? We arrive in what I refer to as ""The Grey Zone"". The mysterious and deadly zone of confusion, misinterpretation, and downright ignorance. Do we register our cars because we own them? No. We register them because we DRIVE them. There is no law that requires your vehicle be registered if it is to remain on private property. They are required to be registered in order to drive them on PUBLIC roads. But here is the crucial element that divides the PRO Gun side and the PRO Gun Control side - Driving a car on PUBLIC roads is NOT a right. You, nor I, nor anyone, has the right to drive a car. In order to exercise this PRIVILEGE you have to agree to abide by the rules, laws, and regulations of that privilege. Owning a Firearm, however, is a right. It was a right before the US was created, and will continue to be a right long after the US is gone. The Government is NOT after your guns you crazies!!! No part of the gun control debate is as toxic, ruins relationships, and gets you on a ""watch"" list more than the idea that the 2nd Amendment was written as a reminder that the Citizens have the right to own ARMS in order to use them against our own government. Here's the thing, that's EXACTLY what the 2nd Amendment was written for. The PRO Gun Control side argues that the 2nd Amendment was written to protect hunting. But in 1776 the right to hunt was obvious to all Founders that it was not needed to be written down. Why? If you didn't hunt, you didn't eat. The Pro Gun Control side argues that the 2nd Amendment was written so that the US could protect itself from outside nations and internal threats such as native american attacks. But if you keep reading the Constitution it clearly states that the Government has the authority to raise armies to protect the homeland. Why state the same thing twice? Redundancies are one thing, inefficiency is another. The 13 States had just won a brutal and bloody war of Secession by using their firearms against their own government.

Therefore I only have to demonstrate that there is a definition out there which conflates Atheism and Agnosticism, and it is Atheism in some sense. The bar is pretty low and as I have shown in round 1: ""an agnostic atheist"" is an atheist in some sense, so my opponent's resolution is negated. That alone should merit voting in my favor. However, in this round I will offer more rebuttals of my opponent's claims, which I hope will solidify the win. Pro : ""What most theories of knowledge purport knowledge to be is namely, a justified true 'belief.'"" Response : I believe my opponent is referring to the tripartite theory of knowledge [1], but that theory has been refuted by Gettier cases [2] which show that some justified true beliefs do not constitute knowledge. Furthermore, I would posit that knowledge might be better defined as the ""mental grasp of the facts of reality."" [3] Thus, there is a distinction between knowledge and belief, which was also demonstrated in the table which I presented in Round 1. Pro: ""In simple prose, gnosticism is logically equivalent to saying 'I can know.' While agnosticism is logically equivalent to saying 'I cannot know.' The former affirms knowledge, the latter denies knowledge."" Response: Since I have shown that knowledge and belief are different, the above statement from my opponent actually reaffirms my position. Therefore, I would refer my opponent back to the chart from round 1 to show how the terms ""agnostic"" and ""atheist"" can be conflated together without redefining atheism. My opponent's remaining argument is based on the false assumption that knowledge is a justified belief and is subsequently not sound. Even my opponent's own source ( <URL>... ) clearly supports my position: ""'Agnostic' is more contextual than is 'atheist', as it can be used in a non-theological way, as when a cosmologist might say that she is agnostic about string theory, neither believing nor disbelieving it."" Again, this demonstrates that atheism is a term that is used in a theological context, whereas agnosticism can be applied to various contexts. When applied to the theological context, it can be conflated with the term theism or atheism without redefining either one. Pro: ""Rather an atheist must justify his ""God doesn't exist"" claim by showing somehow that God, in fact, does not exist."" Response: If we're talking about a Gnostic Atheist, then yes, the she would have to show that god does not exist. However, if we're talking about an Agnostic Atheist, then it is not necessary to justify non-belief in god. This is a good example why such a distinction is necessary and the conflation of the two terms actually provides that distinction. Pro: ""My opponent does this by claiming, again, mistakingly, that atheism is a lack of belief, not the denial of a belief. The difference is subtle yet important if any fair discussion is going to commence between both parties."" Response: I think that the distinction is not necessarily relevant to the resolution of this debate, as I have already demonstrated that the two terms can be conflated together without changing the definition of atheism. The distinction is indeed subtle and I don't particularly have an objection to the use of either definition. Pro: ""This subtly, when closely examined, becomes a fundamental double standard, striking any honest seeker of truth with vagueness and dishonesty right out of the gates."" Response: The only seeker of truth that finds such distinction dishonest is one that has incorrectly understood knowledge to be the same as belief, as my opponent seems to have done. The burden of proof is on the person that's taking the affirmative position and claiming otherwise would be truly dishonest. I have not sidestepped anything and it should be rather clear that a Gnostic Atheist has the same burden of proof as a Gnostic Theist. However, it is also true that neither an Agnostic Theist nor an Agnostic Atheist have the burden of proof, since they're the default position with respect to the positive claims of their Gnostic counterparts. Reductio ad Absurdum If my opponent's position is true, then it should make sense in another context: if my opponent believes that Big Foot does not exist , then my opponent would have to provide justification for that belief. More importantly, my opponent would also have the burden of proof that Big Foot does not exist . Indeed, this notion is absurd and it clearly demonstrates that Pro's position would hold true even in absurd cases. You can replace Big Foot with numerous other absurdities and you would end up violating a central philosophical concept. However, with the definitions I've provided, we can clearly identify where the burden of proof rests and it's always on the party which takes the affirmative position. Conclusion Again, I would like to point out that I have already negated my opponent's resolution, because I've shown that there is a definition out there which conflates Atheism and Agnosticism and it is Atheism in some sense: that alone should be sufficient to win this debate. If we assume that my opponent's argument is true, then we would have to do away with the fundamental philosophical concept which states that the burden of proof rests on the position asserting a claim. I have also demonstrated that Pro has reached several conclusions based on the false premise that knowledge is defined as a justified belief, therefore making my opponent's argument unsound. The differences gained by the use of the terms gnostic/agnostic allow us to correctly place the burden of proof on a person taking the affirmative position and not on the critic. [1] <URL>...

Quick definitions: Drone - unmanned aircraft owned by the United States Insurgent - anybody deemed by the United States to be an ""insurgent"" I am limiting this debate to the United States because no other country uses drones as much as they do (so far as we know) To justify this case, I will present four main contentions. To win this debate, my opponent needs to show that each of these four contentions is false, and that there is at least one good reason why drones are superior to foot soldiers. 1) They are prone to failing. Osama Bin Laden stated that the main reason he was able to hold his position at Tora Bora was because drones do not target underground, which is where his fighters were hiding. Drones are highly likely to crash, costing millions of dollars [1]. They are also ineffective at killing those whom they are designed to kill - on average for every one militant killed, so are at least ten civilians [2]. On another occasion, a counter-insurgency adviser to General David Petraeus said that about 98% of the deaths were civilians [3]. This is because drone pilots are more likely to ignore civilians, children and innocents when carrying out their operations, as they don't need to deal with it themselves [4]. These pilots also tend to see the situation more as a video game [5] and have less collective morale [6]. The point is that the war is not without cost, it is simply that it is another race of people we are shifting the cost on to (Pakistanis, Iraqis) although they don't deserve it (as Peter Singer demonstrates in his excellent book ""Wired for War""). 2) The United States needs the cooperation of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq to carry out their operations successfully - otherwise the entire country will decide to start hating the United States and thus become insurgents. These are largely tribal countries, where bravery is an important virtue. The cowardice of drone strikes, coupled with the large civilian killings, breeds public disgust. Therefore using drones exclusively will not solve the problem of terrorism, rather make it worse[7]. Further, surgical precise killings of a few critical positions, as drones offer, do not actually harm the movement at all. New leaders simply come along. The problem is the supply lines, and these cannot be dealt with from the air - ground personnel are needed! Remember what happened after we killed al-Zarqawi in 2006 [8]? 3) The lack of percieved risk may cause certain governments to start wars more frequently [6]. Using drones often will make it seem like you don't need to risk people's lives to go to war - and thus governments will attempt to impose their will on others whenever they want. God help me if New Zealand is caught in the crossfire! Actually lives will be lost, whether it be in the aggressor's country or the defender's. Who knows - maybe enemy drones would prove more effective than yours. 4) Their legality is, at best, questionable [9]. They appear to ignore the Geneva convention as they do not differentiate between civilians and soldiers. There is no specific law allowing their use in warfare. When the CIA tried to kill Baitullah Mehsud using drones, the drones took the lives of between 207 and 321 civilians before, fourteen months and two plane crashes later, Mehsud was found and killed. Properly trained and equipped, an elite unit would have been able to achieve the same effect without the civilian casualties and at a lower cost.

He points out that ""Forty years ago, you would barely find someone who believed in gay marriage as being right"". He says that like it is a good thing; I do not believe it was, and there are religious groups who agree. Since ""religion"" as a whole does not agree with Pro (nor could it, as it encompasses a huge swath of opinions), is Pro arguing that religion is a better grounding, or that his religion is a better grounding? And upon what grounds? Pro claims that ""religions will always have a set line that shouldn't be crossed"". I've already shown how that isn't the case; the examples I gave of religious groups that now accept gay marriage clearly changed their minds on the matter. Thus, religion is just as capable of having ""movable morals"". I remind Pro of the sheer number of laws in the Bible that call for the death penalty. Is he advocating as much for the death penalty to those who pick up sticks on the sabbath? Or a betrothed woman who doesn't shout loud enough when she's being raped? And even taken at face value, morals having no basis in rationality or possibility of change only make sense if you accept premises of religion that not everyone accepts, such as the moral perfection of the lawgiver. If that isn't presumed, then what you potentially have are WRONG moral prescripts that are unchangeable. Is it Pro's position better to have wrong morals so long as they don't change? Pro goes on to say that the bible speaks against homosexuality. He gives no grounds why that's a good thing, instead appealing to a ""slippery slope"" when he asks us to ""imagine what will be allowed by society movable morality [sic] in the next few decades."" Pro has not established why an ""immovable morality"" is inherently better than a movable one. I would argue that, indeed, it is not. Arguments about the ""immovable morality"" of the bible were used to justify slavery, until society's ""movable morals"" let us see how wrong it was. Pro closes with two false equivalencies: ""Religions= non movable lines of morality that shouldn't be crossed. Right is right and wrong is wrong."" As previously noted, I have showed this as both not inherently true, and not necessarily a good thing even if it is. ""Secular= movable lines of morality. Right is right and wrong can also be right. This leaves no room for wrong."" This is a straw man argument. Secular morality is not inherently nihilistic. Secular morality requires the application of reason to moral arguments. Morality that never changes is only good if you already presuppose that it is perfect. Absent that presupposition, you run the risk of enshrining wrong morals forever, if you accept Pro's already-shown-to-be-fallacious argument that religious morality never changes. Pro has given no reason for us to think that gay marriage is wrong, or that homosexuality is immoral, but he claims that society's acceptance of those things makes his view of religion better, because it hasn't changed. The same argument could be applied to slavery, to the murder of those of other faiths, and to acceptance of rape (as long as you try to marry the victim). This is not intended as an attack on the bible, per se, but rather to point out that Pro's view on the immobility of morality is dramatically flawed. Morality should be based on reason, and when society realizes it has made a mistake, it is reason which should allow us to realize and fix it.

Pro closes with two false equivalencies:  
  
  ""Religions= non movable lines of morality that shouldn't be crossed. Right is right and wrong is wrong.""  
As previously noted, I have showed this as both not inherently true, and not necessarily a good thing even if it is.  
  
  ""Secular= movable lines of morality. Right is right and wrong can also be right. This leaves no room for wrong.""  
This is a straw man argument. Secular morality is not inherently nihilistic. Secular morality requires the application of reason to moral arguments.  
  
Morality that never changes is only good if you already presuppose that it is perfect. Absent that presupposition, you run the risk of enshrining wrong morals forever, if you accept Pro's already-shown-to-be-fallacious argument that religious morality never changes.  
  
Pro has given no reason for us to think that gay marriage is wrong, or that homosexuality is immoral, but he claims that society's acceptance of those things makes his view of religion better, because it hasn't changed. The same argument could be applied to slavery, to the murder of those of other faiths, and to acceptance of rape (as long as you try to marry the victim).  
  
This is not intended as an attack on the bible, per se, but rather to point out that Pro's view on the immobility of morality is dramatically flawed. Morality should be based on reason, and when society realizes it has made a mistake, it is reason which should allow us to realize and fix it.

Some may think God cares and it seems Edward Herbert was that sort. Some are agnostic about it, and some do think God doesn't care.

Contention 1- Pizza delivery men and women are the backbone of the working class. Their sheer strength and determination to deliver your pizza on time to the destination, which could be miles away, overpowers the most terrifying traffic jams and the most heinous of experiences to bring you a pizza pie. These brave souls are the very deffinition of good old fashioned working class Americans. A character type that is almost extinct.  
  
Contention 2- When pizza delivery workers recieve their pay the manager takes in to account the money expected to be made from tips through the hours that the delivery person works. This is not only a bottom scraping pay check it also woudnt cover the rising cost of gas. The price of gas is almost 4 dollars a gallon an will soon rise to 5 dollars by the end of the coming year. Not many people realize that the average pizza man makes 15 dollars an hour if you are an experienced and veteran driver. And as i previously stated this doesnt cover the cost of gas which cleaves the profit to below the Federal Government set standards of pay.

In reality, this debate was meant to express your opinion about Justin Bieber, and make other people aware that there is no reason to hate him.

People look at Justin Bieber: young, has the looks, has the talent, has the ladies, has the world's eye on him, and they realize that Justin has accomplished everything in their imagination. Then, they look at what he is actually doing, singing, and they find minute imperfections, like country origin and voice, and they begin to think that he has unfairly gained this position of fame he is in, and that he doesn't deserve it. Soon, people begin to associate all sorts of negative things with him, like the declining popularity of other young artists or the decreasing etiquette in America.

The most well known military orders were the Templar Knights, Knights of Santiago, and the Hospitallers of St. John. The military orders fought against pagans and Muslims depending upon the Crusade. In today's time, the Catholic Church has been reduced to a dwindling number of military orders. Those military orders don't fight in wars or experience combat. Instead the military orders are symbolic. The Catholic Church is incapable of waging wars like the Northern Crusades, the Reconquista, and the Crusades for the Holy Land. Therefore, they have become physically weak compared to the Church's history. [3] <URL>... 2. The Catholic Church has become weak politically. The Catholic Church has been rendered impotent in terms of their political influence. At one period of time, the Catholic Church was capable of coronations, excommunications, and Crusades. Coronations and blessings from the Catholic Church would allow sovereigns to be seen as legitimate. At one time in history, the Pope would be able to give a king respect by having a coronation. Or how a bishop would give the Catholic Church's blessing to a marriage of a king or queen. A good example of this would be how Pope Urban II excommunicated Philip I for his adulterous behavior[4]. If the Pope excommunicated someone of significance into today's time it would be inconsequential. The Pope can not call for a crusade against the opponents of the church. Well perhaps, he can call for it but no one with power will respond. In the past, Kings and Princes would of rushed to the Pope's aid. But not anymore.

Instead they have been pressured into conforming to secular beliefs.An example of this would be how before the mid-century, all non-Catholics went to Hell according to Catholic Church[5].

I thank my opponent for the response and appreciate the actual posting of an argument for once in my debate career.  
====================  
Refutation  
====================  
Refutation 1) ""Annbella's grammar and spelling is atrocious. During her seven debates, she has made numerous spelling and grammatical errors. ""I don't know, what I should debate about!!!!! I'm in school and i have to do beside just sit here!!!""""  
  
I can understand why this would be a major point. Her spelling and grammar are completely atrocious. However, this does not have to do with the resolution. In the title, it states ""Annbella is an awful debater"". The keyword being debater, not grammatical perfectionist. Furthermore, while you may say that spelling and grammar are a necessity to debate on this site, I must disagree. There is no spelling needed in real life debate, nor grammar in some cases. You are referencing online, however you have no knowledge if she debates exrtracurricularly, or even competitively. Using myself as an example. I have lost 1 debate and won 1 debate on this site. This does not reflect on how well I perform in real life.  
Evidence 1:   http://www.nflonline.org...  
As you can see I am highly regarded by the National Forensic League, a well known and prominent debate institution. So while she may debate poorly on this site, she may debate well in real life, which your resolution does not specify.  
  
Refutation 2: ""Point 3  
Annbella does not show proper respect for her opponent.  
In zero of her seven debates she has shown any respect for her opponent by thanking them for accepting or for replying.""  
  
As of now you have been doing the exact same thing. You said: """"For now, I accept the definitions and terms my opponent has offered.""  
  
I have set the definitions in the first round. They will not change. You have not just accepted them ""for now"", but rather for the duration of the debate.""  
  
I find this rather rude, so what you find disrespectful and what most others find disrespectful are sometimes contrasting and in this case, I believe Annbella was more juvenile than disrespectful.  
  
Refutation 3: ""Point 4  
Annbella has won zero debates. She has had multiple opportunities against high ranking opponents and lower ranking opponents, and she has failed to prevail in one single debate.""  
  
Thats completely fine. As a matter of fact, more than 1/3 of DDO members that are registered have won 0 debates.

1020,"The fact that evolution took place is undeniable. I am not disputing that evolution took place. So arguments that evolution took place to advance living organisms on Earth to the point of humanity as it exists today is irrelevant. This is not an argument on Genesis or scripture. But what we call ""Natural"" selection, is in truth anything but ""Natural"". Let me explain first why this is possible, addressing my opponent's ""If this were true, then where did this intelligence creating intelligence come from?"" That is on its face ridiculous. We humans are intelligent. During the last thousand years, we have caused tremendous changes in the eco-system, and more importantly, we have brought tremendous changes in the characteristics of animals. Through selective husbandry, we have bred animals for speed, strength, weight, and intelligence. If we accept opponent's arguments, then it is impossible for us to have created/bred intelligence in other organisms through intelligent and organized design, because then ""where did that one come from?"" Now that being said, I first have to show of course that it is possible for our ""evolution"" to have taken place according to an intelligent design. Let me clarify, when I say ""God"" I do not mean the God of the bible or Koran or any specific holy text of any specific religion. I simply mean an entity(ies) tremendously superior to ourselves who have powers beyond our ability to comprehend. Just as the bacteria we manipulate cannot grasp the tools and devices through which we operate, if God operates on the evolutionary path of humanity and interferes to produce intelligent humans, why is it inconceivable we would not be able to detect the means by which they take action? That they operate through evolution is not inconsistent with the fact that they operate. Of course the third part, the crux of my argument is to show that not only is it possible, it is likely that we have experienced intervention from God, resulting in the creation of humanity as it is today. Here I address first the statement ""It isn't that good. It isn't that robust."" Creation is a difficult task and we have no reason to believe that God would waste time making us perfect. That we are not perfect is not relevant. The genetic manipulations we carry out are not perfect either, but that does not mean we did not interfere in the development of bacteria. And once again, from the perspective of bacteria, we are Gods. Multicellular life has existed on Earth for about 1 billion years. This indicates there is a high probability of intelligent design in our creation. First, ""However, there is also a gradual trend as far as intelligent life goes. It is true that human-style intelligence seems rare, but intelligence in organisms seems to be quite common and trends toward the more intelligent over the less intelligent."" There is no reason for evolution to proceed towards greater intelligence. Intelligence is just one of thousands of characteristics that promote survival and reproduction. Chimpanzees, which are highly intelligent, are no more successful than antelopes or lions or crocodiles. Dolphins, which are highly intelligent, are no more successful than sharks, or whales, or tuna. If intelligence is not particularly key to survival and reproduction, the fact that there is an evolutionary trend towards intelligence, which only started recently in the last several million years, is evidence that something took place to bring about this transformation. Evolution is DIVERGENT. The fact that crows, dolphins, and humans began developing intelligence at the same time even though they exist in environments that are completely unrelated is strong evidence of an outside force. Secondly, operating on the postulate of continuous time, it is impossible for intelligence and humanity to have developed at the point it did about 3 million years ago. In fact, at any point in development, the probability of random development at that point is 0. Only when an outside force intervenes to choose that point does it become possible for that point to happen. Therefore humanity could not have developed at random. And therefore God created humanity.",1,MoonDragon613,"

1028,"I will first address my opponent's claims with counterarguments, then I will defend my own points. COUNTERARGUMENT ONE - Consistency in Beliefs Consistency in beliefs is not in itself morally admirable. For instance, wociety would like a cold blooded killer to act inconsistently with his beliefs, society would want him to have as many views inconsistent with his murderous ways as possible. Consistency itself is not good; consistent moral behavior, however, is. War, and perhaps even the death penalty, have their proper times. It is not morally admirable to have a blanket opposition to them. One must learn to weigh each situation and decide if war is worth it, rather than opposing war at all costs. My opponent has even suggested that Protestantism is more in line with this sort of deliberation (Protestants neither are in favor of every war nor are against every war, whereas, if my opponent is to be believed, Catholics oppose war on a fundamental level). COUNTERARGUMENT TWO - The way to salvation - good works vs. faith alone There are two sides of this point. First, as my opponent has noted, Catholicism gives people more incentive to do good works, and that's admirable. However, it gives people the worst reasons to do 'good works' - greed and selfishness - ideals Christianity itself looks down on. Any morally good act means quite a bit less when the reasoning behind it was some guy seeking eternal happiness for himself. It is more morally admirable to do good works out of ones own character rather than merely to reap some reward. COUNTERARGUMENT THREE - Individualism My opponent argues that Protestantism has always stood for individualism. This is superior to the alternative - conforming to the agenda of some group. Sure, some group might want you to not be greedy and care about your fellow man, but if the only reason you're doing those things is because you're conforming to a group, that's not very morally impressive. Thinking for oneself and deciding to be moral on ones own - that is morally admirable. Supressing the ability of people to think for themselves - that is morally repugnant. Further, most Protestant sects teach that generosity is superior to greed. DEFENDING ARGUMENT 1 - Pope, Misplaced Authority My opponent has compared the pope to ordinary pastors, but this is fairly nonsensical. If a pastor says something ridiculous, it is not taboo to call him out on it. Pastors are not seen as having divine authority. While pastors may have more authority than they should, there is a larger amount of undue authority in Catholicism, and thus Protestantism is more admirable in this regard. Also, the example of Catholics who don't believe the infallibility of the Pope is a non-sequitur. Catholicism, the religion, is what we're discussing, and it teaches that the Pope does have that authority. The fact that many Catholics happen to be smart enough to see through that is not morally beneficial for the religion itself, though it is fortuitous. DEFENDING POINT TWO - Moral Qualms My opponent asks if this is similar to the American Civil War. It is, in a way - but in a reverse way from how my opponent tries to paint it. Slavery had been the status quo. Part of the country decided that slavery wasn't okay. The ones who remained the same (as the Catholics largely did) was the south, who continued keeping slaves in spite of the moral qualms many people had with it. The north reformed its beliefs, as the Protestants did in splitting from Catholicism. My opponent claims that Protestantism is ""pro-death penalty"" but this claim is unsubstantiated. It may be true that many Protestants happen to be Pro-death penalty, but Protestantism itself does not preach a pro-death penalty stance. We are arguing the moral admirability of religions, not of followers thereof. DEFENDING ARGUMENT THREE - Rituals My opponent points out that Protestantism, too, is ritualistic. True enough, but Catholicism outritualizes it. Catholics, for instance, place a large focus on repeating certain prayers, like in the Rosary, where the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary prayer are repeated a good amount of times. There's the praying to various saints to which I referred in my last round. There's penance (confession) - if you do anything wrong, you have to undergo the sacrament of penance, telling some priest whatever sins you have comitted (he often makes you do some more praying, for good measure). In fact, there is a much larger focus in Catholicism on sacraments and rites overall. This not only wastes a great deal of time for all people involved, it also makes people think prayer is more important than it is (all studies on prayer have shown it has no effectiveness in curing disease, helping the impoverished, etc.) - people will be more likely to just pray for someone instead of going out and helping them - they'll think their prayer constitutes help when it does not. Such ritualism necessarily draws people away from understanding how the world actually works. This is morally negative. I now give the floor back to my opponent.",1,beem0r,"
  
I will first address my opponent's claims with counterarguments, then I will defend my own points.  
  
COUNTERARGUMENT ONE - Consistency in Beliefs  
  
Consistency in beliefs is not in itself morally admirable. For instance, wociety would like a cold blooded killer to act inconsistently with his beliefs, society would want him to have as many views inconsistent with his murderous ways as possible. Consistency itself is not good; consistent moral behavior, however, is.  
  
War, and perhaps even the death penalty, have their proper times. It is not morally admirable to have a blanket opposition to them.

Catholicism, the religion, is what we're discussing, and it teaches that the Pope does have that authority. The fact that many Catholics happen to be smart enough to see through that is not morally beneficial for the religion itself, though it is fortuitous.  
  
DEFENDING POINT TWO - Moral Qualms  
  
My opponent asks if this is similar to the American Civil War. It is, in a way - but in a reverse way from how my opponent tries to paint it. Slavery had been the status quo. Part of the country decided that slavery wasn't okay. The ones who remained the same (as the Catholics largely did) was the south, who continued keeping slaves in spite of the moral qualms many people had with it. The north reformed its beliefs, as the Protestants did in splitting from Catholicism.  
  
My opponent claims that Protestantism is ""pro-death penalty"" but this claim is unsubstantiated. It may be true that many Protestants happen to be Pro-death penalty, but Protestantism itself does not preach a pro-death penalty stance. We are arguing the moral admirability of religions, not of followers thereof.  
  
DEFENDING ARGUMENT THREE - Rituals  
  
My opponent points out that Protestantism, too, is ritualistic. True enough, but Catholicism outritualizes it. Catholics, for instance, place a large focus on repeating certain prayers, like in the Rosary, where the Lord's Prayer and Hail Mary prayer are repeated a good amount of times. There's the praying to various saints to which I referred in my last round. There's penance (confession) - if you do anything wrong, you have to undergo the sacrament of penance, telling some priest whatever sins you have comitted (he often makes you do some more praying, for good measure). In fact, there is a much larger focus in Catholicism on sacraments and rites overall. This not only wastes a great deal of time for all people involved, it also makes people think prayer is more important than it is (all studies on prayer have shown it has no effectiveness in curing disease, helping the impoverished, etc.) - people will be more likely to just pray for someone instead of going out and helping them - they'll think their prayer constitutes help when it does not.  
Such ritualism necessarily draws people away from understanding how the world actually works. This is morally negative.

1033,"My thanks to Con for his previous argument. Rebuttal Con's argument appears to be that God can be perfect without being infinite argued in 2 different manners. 1) If God has everything he wants or needs he is perfect. 2) Omnipotent does not necessarily mean unlimited power. Both of these arguments imply a limited perfectness, like as my opponent suggested a full glass of water perfectly full but of finite nature. The problem with this analogy is that a glass of water is an inanimate object. I am of the opinion that my previous argument holds against these arguments. The premise is that God has everything he wants or needs he is perfect, and yet we know from our own existence that we seek that which we do not have. If God is not all powerful then he has limitations just like us. If he has limitations he cannot be in an eternal state of completeness within himself because what can an infinite mind contemplate for all of time except for the infinite itself. Now this leads to one of two conclusions. God's nature is infinite and thus infinitely powerful and intelligent, or God's intellect is finite. If God's intellect is finite we return to my argument from last round whereby God must be fundamentally evil. If God's intellect is not infinite then he cannot be guaranteed that his morality is perfect. If his morality is not perfect, it is both possible that someone could act more morally than him. Additionally, God would be intrinsically immoral to judge any of us is he cannot be guaranteed to have perfect morality. This reasoning applies to both arguments. Any limitations on God's power to implement as much of anything that possibly could be would ultimately mean that God's intellect could not be perfect if God were to be fully self-sufficient. If God is not fully self sufficient then he needs to make us in order to create things to help satisfy himself. Ultimately nothing that he could create would truly satisfy and by creating us as immortal beings as well, he would condemn us to never being able to be eternally satisfied. This turns God into a ginormous child trying to amuse himself with a spiritual magnifying glass and puts us in the place of the ants. Argument Recap I will quickly recap my argument from Round 1 as I do not believe that Con has actually proved it to be logically in error. - If God is not infinitely powerful, he cannot be infinitely intelligent. - If not infinite in these attributes he cannot be unchangeable because limitation imply the possibility for growth and change. - If not unchangeable then knowable perfect love and justice do not exist. - This make the application of any love or justice false as we cannot know if they are in-line with true love and justice or not. - Additionally, if God is not infinite he cannot be fully self sufficient, because God would have limits. - If God has limits he cannot be assured that his love and justice are perfect. - If his love and justice are not perfect it would be immoral to condemn people to hell. - If he admitted us all to heaven, where we would live forever in his presence, we would eventually exhaust the nature of God. If we could exhaust his nature we would be in an eternal torment of boredom. Ultimately we would come to hate everything and everyone because instead of them all leading us to something more, we would all be in an eternal state limitation to our mind. Thus heaven would be just as much of a torment as hell. Conclusion The infinite power of God is logically necessary for a perfectly loving and just God to exist. Without these attributes God would be infinitely evil to create other eternal beings to share in an eternal limited existence.",1,Geogeer,"

The people vote for the President. The USA may not be a ""pure democracy"" (one where each person votes on each issue), however it is very much a democracy.

Neither does his contention that a democracy does not have a constitution nor that a republic necessarily does have one. The fact that the Constitution does not mention the word ""democracy"" does not mean that the USA is not a democracy. It is not up to the Constitution, nor is it up the founding fathers, to decide what the definition of ""democracy"" is. I have read my opponent's sources. Firstly, both of his sources (devvy.com and garymcleod.org) are basically opinion-based essays. Secondly, neither of them is written by anyone who can be said to be an expert in the field. Thirdly, neither of them is in line with the dictionary definition of democracy; a definition that my opponent himself has taken the liberty to use. Thirdly, I contend that my opponent's use of those sources must be limited to his argument. In other words, they can be used to say ""what I have written as my argument was also supported by someone else"". They can't, however, be used as an argument in and of itself. In other words, any reasoning put in those sources by their authors does not form part of the present debate. To form such part, it would have to be written into my opponent's argument within the debate. I have demonstrated that the USA is a democracy. It fairly and squarely meets the very definition used by my opponent. Secondly, it is described by wikipedia as a democracy. Thirdly, it is 17th in the democracy index. Is the USA a republic? The definition of ""republic"" is as follows: ""1 a (1): a government having a chief of state who is not a monarch and who in modern times is usually a president (2): a political unit (as a nation) having such a form of government b (1): a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law (2)"" ( <URL>... ) Again this is a source used by my opponent in his very argument. The first part of the definition distinguishes republic from a monarchy. This is in fact (I would suggest) the most common usage given to the term.

The only problem is that I realized that the odds were against my opponent in this debate and I would most likely win this debate.

  Introduction  
  You will remember in my second round that I said my refutation cannot be defeated by virtue of its existing outside of all principles of logic. It seemed that CON had at least a working grasp of this point as he seemed to summarize the corpus of my argument in a relatively succinct and correct manner. How he was led so quickly astray in his immediate responses thereafter is somewhat of a mystery to me. But I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was because of some wanting clarity in my bygone round.  
  What's the Problem?  
  In this section my opponent gives us this confused response:  
  In my opponent's logic, God tries to create an unliftable stone, but even when he thinks he has succeeded, he defies all logic and lifts the stone anyway. In other words,     God fails to create a stone he truly cannot lift  .  
  But this quandary is so far off base from what I asserted that I am baffled he could make it. A God who can, by definition, do anything that can be phrased as an action,   can truly create a stone that he cannot lift  . The stone will   REMAIN   a stone that he truly cannot lift, however, the phrase God can lift a stone that he truly cannot lift-- though totally illogical and self-contradictory-- remains perfectly within his power to do so by virtue of his existing outside of logical principles.  
  In other words, my opponent does not understand the true profundity of this argument as he continues to grab and cling to principles of logic that have no bearing on God's actions. Since the omnipotence paradox assumes maximal omnipotence in order to phrase its dilemma, it fails even if all its premises are true. What does the omnipotence paradox set out to do? You'll remember in my round 1 that I stated the omnipotence paradox seeks to show God cannot exist because omnipotence is logically impossible. But since the paradox itself assumes a God that can do logically impossible things, it is not enough to show that omnipotence is beyond God's power to do - even if it is logically impossible! So even if we grant all the premises inherent in the omnipotence paradox it fails by virtue of defining God as a being with maximal omnipotence. In essence, if God can do the logically impossible, how in the world is showing that omnipotence is logically impossible of any force?  
  Here is another portion of my opponent's last round:  
  - can God create a stone so big even he cannot lift it? If the premise of this argument is that God can defy logic, then to be unliftable by God the stone need be unable to be lifted even if logic is defied. The answer to this problem, according to my opponent's logic, is necessarily no, because in step 3 we read that God is able to lift the stone by defying logic.  
  He has anticipated an answer of mine that is simply not true. My answer to the problem would necessarily be ""yes."" The moment logic is defied, there is nothing at all that is contradictory! Therefore there is nothing at all wrong with the phrase God can lift a rock that is absolutely, positively impossible for him to lift. In fact, there is nothing contradictory with the stone remaining too heavy for God to lift even while he lifts it.  
  But I thought logic was irrelevant!?  
  This section is as egregiously confused as the previous, and I hope my added clarity will prevent any future     mishaps. My opponent near the end this portion gives us this tidbit:  
  It does not follow that an illogical God makes all illogical arguments concerning him logical.     
  Let's think together. What DOES follow from a God that is not bound by any logic whatsoever? It seems only fair to say that all arguments against God that rely upon any form of logic are without merit. Let's phrase this syllogistically:  
  P1. God is not bound by any principles of logic per maximal omnipotence.  
  P2. Arguments that seek to disprove God via principles of logic fail (see P1).  
  P3. The omnipotence paradox seek to disprove an omnipotent God via principles of logic.  
  C: The omnipotence paradox fails (per P2 and P3).  
  Questions for my Opponent  
  The following questions may aid in the elimination of future misunderstandings.  
  1. Do you understand what maximal omnipotence is?  
  2. If God has maximal omnipotence, why is it that he cannot create a stone that he truly cannot lift?  
  3. Why is it that a stone cannot remain a stone that God truly cannot lift while God simultaneously may lift it at his leisure? Is it because this may violate certain logical principles?  
  4. How does the absurdity of ""God can do what God can't"" matter at all if maximal omnipotence is assumed?  
  5. If all the premises of the Omnipotence Paradox are true, what does it prove and is this enough?  
  6. If logic is defied, does an answer to any given quandary still need to be ""yes"" or ""no?""  
  Conclusion  
  I am hoping we will have made more progress in these latter rounds.

I responded to all my opponents arguments in a fair way, and argued the debate exactly the way he as pro with the burden of proof argued. Conclusion So at the end of this debate, we can weigh several things into the factoring of our determining how we decide on this resolution. 1. What is the impact behind the resolution? My opponent made a great point saying that discriminating pedophiles is not considered negative behavior. So there is a certain impact behind how we discriminate. That said, in the last round my opponent also said that I took this debate out of context. In the end, the point still proves exactly what my opponent was trying to say when he said the bit about pedophilia.

My opponent has countered with many bible quotes, while saying that I have a lack of understanding of the bible myself. But he never went on to dispute the interpretation of Bible.org, which seemed like a fairly good Christian Justification from an established Christian organization. In many of the ways that Christians may feel they will be discriminated against, they could completely do without by accepting homosexuality into their establishments while attempting to cure them. This works against Pastor Carr's ideals however. 3. Violence and protests are not a reason to assume that religion will be widely discriminated against. This is a very loose point, with a lot of stretching behind it. A few people do not make up an entire group of people, same goes for Christianity. That said, a lot of the sources and videos provided were very horrible examples of ""discrimination"" itself. There is a lot of the blame game that goes on in these types of social issues on the other party. But realistically, are Christians getting discriminated against as a whole? No. When they have more rights (and probably always will) over the individuals they think they are being discriminated against, it seems silly to make such statements.

In addition to breaking the rules my opponent has set up, I am also disregarding the site rules that demand no profanities when I wrote ""f.uck."" I also agree with my opponent that the rules that he set up demand that breaking the rules carries a penalty of a 7 point forfeit. My opponent assumes that I will therefore lose the debate. However, my opponent has ignored something that I think is central not only to this debate, but all debates on DDO--that is, the Role of the Ballot. The Role of the Ballot is basically how a voter should evaluate a debate. My opponent seems to take for granted that debate is a ""game,"" wherein debaters follow a set of rules and then ""win"" or ""lose,"" regardless of consequences outside this round. My opponent has in fact labeled this debate under ""funny."" He admits in the comment that this debate is ""stupid,"" and that that is the ""point."" If debate is all a game--if debate has no consequences outside of the debate round--then my opponent would be absolutely right that the rules should be followed with no question. However, if debate were all a game, I would be playing chess instead. *** In fact, debate can be far more than a game. Debate is an opportunity for us to seriously consider important issue in the world. Debate, rather than being a contest, is a way for us to re-evaluate the way we think. I have learned much from debating. Through debate I have become a vegetarian, a feminist, and someone who is critical of capitalism and authoritarian government. Other people have experienced different kinds of changes. However, the point of a debate is not to most effectively follow a set of rules and strategies, but actually effecting real change. The people on this debate site, especially my experienced opponent, may become policy-makers or voters, and many already are. This debate site is not a bubble--the way we debate has a real effect on the world. Making that real change is what debate is all about. Therefore, the role of the ballot should be to judge the winner as one who most effectively changes the world for the better. If you are to judge me the winner now, you will in fact be part of an advocacy--an advocacy of making debate about effecting real change, and not meaningless points. I chose not to write ""I accept the terms and conditions"" because I did not accept them. I am not content with the way the debate has been framed here, or in general. By challenging the way we debate through a debate, I am allowing us to re-conseptualize rules. Were people to assume the authority of rules, I would not have the freedom to be on this website.

1071,"Thanks to Andro for accepting. This should be interesting. Observation : 1. The heat death of the universe (when the immortal finally ""dies"") will take over 10^100 years. Thats trillions of trillions of trillions of years. 2. Remember, by definition immortality cannot be given up. Even if the person becomes dissatisfied with their life, they are forced to live on. I've balanced this for Pro by ensuring that her immortal person won't get any permanent disability or illness. C1: Infinite probability The probability of any bad thing happening is 100% over a time period of infinity. So caught inside a tornado - 100%. Engulfed in volcano eruption - 100%. Get trapped under an avalanche - 100%. You can TRY to avoid unlucky things like this, but even if the chance of any of these things happening is 0.000000001% in a normal human life, that becomes 100% over an infinite timeline. To show the implication, I'll specifically pick out the volcano example. Note that Earth won't be around forever (covered later), but assuming it did, over infinity the chances of being caught in a volcano eruption are 100%. After the lava cools it will form a solid cement that will seal off any exits. You would be trapped under hundreds of pounds of volcano cement which would sizzle in heat for weeks. Sleep would become impossible, and the pain and would quickly cause insanity. Apply this to any other low-probability disaster. C2: Eternal boredom Assume you use your immortality wisely. You've got to make the MOST out of your time, right? So you go out, go skydiving, go see the Grand Canyon, visit the Statue of Liberty, meet the president, whatever. You fulfill your entire bucket list. Unfortunately, there's only so many things the universe has to offer. Over an infinite time period, you'll eventually do all there is to do. Entertainment is finite. How do you enjoy life after you've done everything? An immortal person would eventually go into a state of eternal boredom, as all forms of entertainment the universe has to offer have been depleted. C3: Human extinction Humans as a species will not survive for 10^100 more years. Scientist Frank Fenner speculates that humans might be wiped out in as little as 100 (1). Even if thats too pessimistic, anything beyond 1000 seems unlikely. At some point, Earth won't sustain the human race anymore. This will be a big problem for the immortal person who has to live on. Almost every single thing we enjoy relies on other humans in some way or another. For instance, all our electronics rely on people working at the electric company. Most of our food is processed by machines controlled by other people. Transportation devices (cars, planes) require fuel thats controlled by industries run by humans. When humans go extinct the immortal person will have none of these. So the optimistic thought of someone living a life of luxury for all time is an illusion. With no modern technology and no human interaction, the immortal will eventually revert back to caveman status as there will be no human race to sustain energy sources. No human interaction will quickly cause depression, loneliness, and feralization. The result will be something similar to a Feral Child, which is a human who is basically turned into a wild animal due to lack of exposure to human civilization (2). A study by the US National Institute of Health finds that face-to-face human contact with other people is strongly associated with a lower probability of depression (3). So take that away and depression becomes infinitely more likely. Finally, someone who lives forever will be forced to watch as any person they ever love or have connections with dies around them. C4: Planetary destruction Earth isn't going to last 10^100 years, and neither will any other planet. There are currently 186 asteroids that have an impact risk of hitting Earth, any of which would cause a ""global calamity"" (4). There's also the possibility of a nuclear war, making the planet uninhabitable. Over a time period of infinity, a black hole would at some point approach our solar system and consume it. Then its really going to suck that you can't die. When the planet is destroyed then you'll be stuck floating in oxygen-less space for hundreds of years before you ever hit something. The suffering from being unable to breathe and having no food or water would drive you insane. This applies to any other method where the planet doesn't survive. And the sun is going out in 5 billion years (5). That means no light, no trees (and thus no oxygen), and no life, since every food chain starts with plants. But the immortal still cannot die, he is forced to live and suffer in a world with no food, light, or oxygen. C5: Universal timeline A planetless universe (whereby an immortal person would have no pleasures to gain and would merely be stranded in space) is inevitable. By 10^14 years from now, star formation will end. The only things remaining in the universe will be ""compact stars"" which already existed (6). Life on these is NOT pleasant as they are millions of degrees hot. There are several other phases the source describes that the universe will go through before it ends, but all of them have one thing in common: no life. Which makes immortality pretty pointless as there's nothing left to enjoy, and they're just stuck floating around in space for trillions of years as the universe collapses on top of them. Thus, acquiring immortality would not be a rational choice for an individual to make. 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>... 5. <URL>... 6. <URL>...",1,BlackVoid,"

I watched my grandmother try to Google ""Beach"" because she wanted to see a picture of the beach, but instead she ended up googling ""Brazilian A** porn"" because Google f*cking remembers everything I look up and tries to guess what I want like some neurotic clingy girl friend.... Now my grandmother has no idea why shes staring at a video of one woman violating another woman's behind with the handle of a ping pong paddle in my page history because she doesnt know that the little red circle at the top left of the screen means EXIT...  
  
If you still dont think that old people cant use the internet look at Rick Santorum, he decided to ban porn just because he couldnt figure out how to delete his history!!!!  
  
The point is old people cant use the internet and thus are unaffected by memes, therefore we need to hang something over their heads that warns them that basically says ""if you mess up then YOUUUUU ARRRRRRRRE OUTTA HERE!!!!!!"". And nothing says ""America has had enough of you"" quite like forced deportation....",Politics,1,Bad-politicians-should-face-deportation-from-the-US-when-their-terms-end/1/,7101

  OVERVIEW  
  Pro’s job in this round is to support the claim that philosophy is useful degree and he has attempted to do this by showing the usefulness of a philosophy degree in three areas- Career, Life Skills, and the Quest for Knowledge. As I refuted Pro’s contentions in these three areas and showed how a philosophy degree generally fell short of other alternatives, Pro consistently replied that each area on its own is not supposed to show a philosophy degree to be useful but is instead a component of a “cumulative case.”     
  If the success of Pro’s case rests on all his points working together in concert, then if I win that philosophy is decidedly un-useful in any of the above mentioned points then I have successfully refuted Pro’s case as a whole. Since Pro concedes that none of the individual areas alone shows philosophy to be useless,  as he does when he says “  I am not trying to affirm the resolution based on this fact alone, but a number of other facts combined,” he must win in every area for his cumulative case to stand.

  Pro fails to engage in my multi-layer argument by ignoring all my arguments that assume his payscale arguments are correct. I pointed out that even taking payscale data at face value, philosophy is still a middle of the pack degree made worse by its poor starting salary. Even if we ignore the Georgetown study, a philosophy degree vastly underperforms the majority of other degrees- such a performance could not be called useful in any meaningful sense.  
     
  Pro also totally ignores my arguments that philosophy degree is useless because you will never USE it in your job. This point alone is totally ignored by Pro and disproves the resolution. How can a degree be useful if it is never used?  
     1) Pro ignores my analytic explaining how even accounting for the combination of philosophy and religious studies, the payscale data overestimates pay by AT LEAST 23%. Even under the best assumptions it is clear that payscale estimates are high, and this is exactly the results we would expect given the sample bias of the website.        2) Con offers no contradictory evidence to my unemployment rate evidence, so it is a fair stat to use.      3) I agree the VT study is not comprehensive- the only purpose was to show that other datasets agree closely with the Georgetown study.

However, this argument fails for many reasons; 1) First, more water is going to be lost even more if they are in companies' hands, as I have previously stated in my first round, because companies have their desires for profits. Their desire for profits far outweigh the need to preserve water, and to produce more 'water products', they will even risk using an excessive amount of the water resources that we have. This might lead to the depletion of water. 2) Yes, it is true that our lord wouldn't want the water resources to be wasted. But as I have stated, more water resources are going to be lost if they are in private companies' hands. Plus, if water is privatized, that means that the poor people and those who don't have money will not be granted the access to water, a source that is directly related to life. This is already unfair in the means of human rights. Would God really want his people to suffer the situation where they have no water?

Whoever told you that all you had to do was go to church, read the Bible, tithe, go to retreats, etc. is wrong because that's not what makes you a Christian. The Bible doesn't say that being a Christian leads to prosperity. On the contrary, it leads to suffering. I as a Christian suffer every day, but I know that I am redeemed. Romans 3:23-24 ""23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.""

We are saved and receive a change of heart by accepting Jesus and that makes us Christians V. 25 -26 ""25 whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, 26 to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus."" Ephesians 2:8 ""8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."" Now you must realize that the purpose of prayer is so that God's power can work in your life. God brings suffering into your life so that you can see his glory. I illustrate with an example : John 9:1-3 ""Now as Jesus passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. 2 And His disciples asked Him, saying, ""Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"" 3 Jesus answered, ""Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be revealed in him."" By the power of Jesus Christ, we are relieved of our suffering because their purpose is so that he can work in our lives. 1 Peter 3:12 ""12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And His ears are open to their prayers; But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."" Jesus also said that we would suffer, but he gave us the power to endure. John 16:33 ""33 These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.""

1093,""" big pants are usually handed down to children the parents aren't that crazy to go and buy larger pants rather than ones that fit there size."" 1) You mean parents arent crazy about buying pants that fit their kids and arent too large 2) It is ridiculously easy to find fitting clothes for a low price. Salvation army, goodwill, any charity that gives out clothes, all of them allow people to have easy access to clothes that fit 3) If they were handed down then why do the people who wear them exacerbate how big they are? people who have big pants who dont want to sag can fix it by pulling them up when they sag too low, but what is observed in the real world is people letting their back pockets be behind their knees to the point where they are sagging through their own choice, not because of economical reasons ""Also I was saying that since sagging originated from jail and since more black people are common in jail the sagging trend would be more relevant in the African American culture than any other meaning it will disrespect blacks more."" It would only apply to them more, it isnt disrespectful to them unless people ONLY arrest blacks for sagging, but thats not the case nor will it be the case ""9 times out of 10 people aren't going to pay the fine for sagging pants and if you don't what you gonna do send them to jail.""

  "" big pants are usually handed down to children the parents aren't that crazy to go and buy larger pants rather than ones that fit there size.""  1) You mean parents arent crazy about buying pants that fit their kids and arent too large  2) It is ridiculously easy to find fitting clothes for a low price. Salvation army, goodwill, any charity that gives out clothes, all of them allow people to have easy access to clothes that fit  3) If they were handed down then why do the people who wear them exacerbate how big they are? people who have big pants who dont want to sag can fix it by pulling them up when they sag too low, but what is observed in the real world is people letting their back pockets be behind their knees to the point where they are sagging through their own choice, not because of economical reasons  ""Also I was saying that since sagging originated from jail and since more black people are common in jail the sagging trend would be more relevant in the African American culture than any other meaning it will disrespect blacks more.""  It would only apply to them more, it isnt disrespectful to them unless people ONLY arrest blacks for sagging, but thats not the case nor will it be the case  ""9 times out of 10 people aren't going to pay the fine for sagging pants and if you don't what you gonna do send them to jail.""

1094,"I'm not biting the hand that feeds me because Corporate Capitalism doesn't feed me, period. I'm also well aware that it is the predominant economic system of our day, but existence isn't necessarily success.

Not a very good trade-off if you ask me. In absolute terms, the standard of living has been more or less improving throughout history for most peoples; in relative terms, not so much. My primary contentions with Corporate Capitalism are: 1) the unarguable gap in the distribution of wealth in even the wealthiest countries, 2) the massive amount of poverty that exists (again in even the wealthiest countries), which ""the market"" is evidently supposed to fix, 3) the climate of insane consumerism and materialism created by capitalism and its focus on ""the bottom line,"" or profit, 4) the pursuit of material or monetary gain as a means to happiness, even if it means disregarding the well-being of other humans, other species, and the environment in general, once again because it is ""profitable"" to do so, no matter what other consequences occur, and 5) the ridiculous amount of political power attained by corporations.

If the minimum wage is too high, the corporation will move to where it is cheaper and there are less labor restrictions (see China.) This is ignoring the fact that even when laborers are paid at least minimum wage, no one person can really live off of that wage decently in your ""HIGHEST STANDARD OF LIVING IN HUMAN HISTORY"" fantasy land. Ultimately, with Corporate Capitalism, there is no public accountability for actions taken. As much as the government is a mess, at least there is SOME accountability to the citizenry.

1105,"First off I would like to start with a critique of the resolution. The resolution that my opponent put forth is thusly: ""It is Pro's responsibility to show why it is right to use the death penalty and it is Con's responsibility to show why the death penalty is wrong."" yet with the phrases right and wrong certain assumptions are made. The first assumption that is made is that there is some form of objectivity. With this assumption we are saying that X is always wrong or X is always right when this is simply not the case. (Sure some things are objective like numbers and so on but in the case of an action always being condemned or condoned there is never objectivity). And I would like to add an impact to this, when assumptions are made, esspecially if they prove to be incorrect, it lowers legitimacy. Of course the loss of mine or my opponent's legitimacy will most likely not hurt anything in the long run but what if a political leader makes an assumption like this? What if political legitimacy is lowered? When political legitimacy is lowered revolutions ensue[1]. But let's ignore that and move to the on case arguments. //Refutations\First off my opponent argues that there is no deterrence but this is blatantly not true. Studies where done in all 50 states showed that the death penalty does in fact act as a deterrent but not only that, it saves lives![2] Also, ""Professors Hashem Dezhbakhsh, Paul R. Rubin, and Joanna M. Shepherd of Emory University found that each execution, on average, results in 18 fewer murders.""[2] This evidence right here stands in direct contradiction to my opponents evidence which is only referencing countries with already low or lowering murder rates. My opponent also makes a major fallacy here by assuming that because Iceland has the lowest murder rate in the world and that it doesn't use the death penalty, a correlation exists is just not true and misleading. My opponent then makes the argument that the cost of using capital punishment on an inmate is enormous compared the the ""low"" cost of incarceration. First off the assumption that it costs more to kill a prisoner than to have him be in prison for life is just not true. Justice for All says that Life Without Parole costs at least $1.2 million to $3.6 million more than capital punishment cases.[3] ""And life without parole prisoners face, on average, 30 or 40 years in prison while the annual cost of incarceration is $40,000 to $50,000 a year for each prisoner or more! There is no question that the up front costs of the death penalty are significantly higher than for equivalent LWOP cases. There also appears to be no question that, over time, equivalent LWOP cases are much more expensive - from $1.2 to $3.6 million - than death penalty cases.""[3] So as we can see, with this evidence being presented, my opponents argument that the death penalty costs more is false. Next my opponent argues that with the death penalty the killers get off free but that is not the case. Their life is ended. They have no chance to do anything else. That is the worst punishment imaginable! "" But can't we do that anyways by putting them in prison for life for a fraction of the cost?"" No we cannot. Please cross apply my previous evidence regarding the costs which shows that it is actually cheaper to kill prisoners than to keep them in prison AND if you cross apply my evidence that states that capital punishment actually saves lives and thus it's easy to see that this argument does not work on a monetary level and the level of preservation of life. My opponent makes the classic killing the innocent argument but what if they are put in jail for life and and they are either killed in jail or die in jail? That is irreversible as well. But regardless what my opponent wants is a perfect society in which there are no risks but there will always be risks yet we must face them in order to better society and save lives. //Arguments\A: First off I would like to say that since we live in a Democracy majority rules and thus if the majority is in favor of a system is should be kept because if we ignore the voice of the majority we are undermining our own system. But let me get to the important part of this, Americans overwhelmingly support capital punishment[4] and if we are to ignore their wishes we undermine the very system which we fight so hard to protect. B: Maintaining the death penalty promotes a better prison environment for the workers inside. If the death penalty were abolished, violent criminals could murder their guards with no fear of death seeing as Con's plan makes it illegal. If we have a bad work environment we will not draw well educated and compassionate guards.[5] C: I would also like to add deterrence to my case real quick, the Bureau of Criminal Justice compared the number of executions to the number of murders committed and guess what? When more executions were committed, the lower the murder rate was and conversely, the less executions were committed, the higher the murder rate was so this empirically shows that the death penalty DOES have a deterrence effect.[6] D: Not all life sentences are without parole and thus murderers can still get out and commit their crimes again. Here is a list of different criminals who committed violent crimes, were put in jail, got parole and committed the crimes again: <URL>... So as we can see, the death penalty does have a deterrence effect, it saves lives, it ultimately costs less, it provides a safer prison environment and it stops repeat offenders.
