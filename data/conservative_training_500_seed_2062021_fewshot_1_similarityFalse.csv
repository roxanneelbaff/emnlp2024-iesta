11,"First, in closing thank you to my opponent! I enjoyed this exchange, and I greatly admire the intellect my opponent has displayed during the discourse of this debate. History, Legality, and US Foreign Policy: Rwanda: I know the debate isn't about this specifically, however, I must reply, having read Romeo Dallaire's Shake Hands with the Devil this Canadian General showed evidence and his own testimony that the forces in Rwanda even knew about the genocides were going to happen before they actually did and still refused to do anything, and the only forces to enter were Belgium, and Sudan soldiers dawning the UN Barrets. Dallaire was told to stand down, even when he knew where the arms caches to committ the genocides were and even varified. The UN prevented him from doing anything. Secondly, as I noted earlier my opponent cites the failures or inconsistencies of US foreign policy during the course of this debate. As I noted earlier this is irrelevant, he makes an appeal to hypocracy when doing so. The problem with places such as Guatamala, for instance, or indigenous removal during the US presidency of Andrew Jackson, or the Iran-Contra affairs is the context in which they take place to justify their legitimacy or not. For instance, the native removal lacked UN body existing at that time to set up a framework of legality or not. Whereas today we do, and we're only talking about Iraq under Bush Jr. Not any other time of war. Furthermore, I agree that what is inconsistant is the application of enforcement, but that's precisely why me and my opponent agree here and discus Rwanda, we see what happens when it is unenforced, a national outrage and death ensure, which is an argument for invasion not against it. My opponent further submits the conduct of the US was poor, that the framework for the legitimization is unfounded. But the documents notes that they (being the US and Iraq) were never coerced into signing, thus the consent of both parties still remains to the document, so I kindly disagree with my oponent here, he should accept the framework for it, this is also because of Nuremburg, Eichmann, Yugoslavia, etc... And although the conduct was poor, this ignores the scandals in which the people prosecuted for it, and furthermore, ignores the JWT. Even then, it's once again an appeal to hypocracy and is irrelevant. There will always be unintentional deaths in War, what matters is the intention in which it takes place. Which was to liberate a people who were massively persecuted. Should they have been left to fend for themselves they would have surely died. The articles: but it does state may , they have the option of giving that consent or not, and even then it is widely known that the UN only can enforce her laws on the basis of voluntarism. The UN can only make recommendations, not enforce the laws it's self, that it requires on it's members. Canada's handling of the native pop. is an example of this. Furthermore, as noted earlier the cases of Yugoslavia, Nuremburg, Eichmann, etc.. All put the genocide conventions in context, that an ""exception"" can be made legally for the party enforcing the law, so long as other means have been tried. The Iraqi Oil for food program didn't work, what esle was there? Invasion. Iraq didn't despute it's legitimacy, nor did it make an exception to the conventions to recognize her constitution over those docs when signing (as noted earlier) case and point, the competent UN organs can be consulted, but the US did simply by using the Conventions. Finally the JWT may use any of those justifications for invasion, I make the case for military necessity due to the pragmatic application of war, a general would be a fool to invade and expect so much as 1 civillian casualty to be criminal, it realistically isn't possible when all other means were tried and death still resulted espescially in the Iraqi Oil program. What else was there? Death by being idle? Or death via invasion for liberation? In short, I still feel the legality of the war is justified. The basis of International Law in which it rests upon may indeed be flawed, but it is necessary. It saved the Kurdish people. Why Vote for Me? Indeed, this shall be a tough case, I have a worthy foe however, here is why I feel I won. -The framework of International Law was used in Eichmann, Nuremburg, etc... so the legality of the framework in it's practical application may be flawed, but it does work and is enforceable. -The Genocide Conventions, Geneva Conventions justify invasion when considering the Oil for Food Program and it's failures, you cannot force Iraq to take food. -UN works on the principals of vulintarism -The inconsistancies of the application for war is Irrelevant (appeal to hypocracy) -Justified on principal (enemy of man, universial jurisdiction, etc..) and humanitarian grounds (no despute that Saddam was a tyrant in need of removal. -The conduct of the US was poor at times, however those people were arrested and tried when they happened. Outrage ensued by public. -We have seen the effects of genocide before, they are not pretty, and thus, there should be no question that invasion was the way to go (espescially Rwanda and the prior knowledge) -There was 12 reasons for going to war, the US only got 2 half-wrong. One of which was the killing of kurds, which is covered under the conventions. Thank you to my opponent for a pleasant exchange!

13,"Alrighty then. Allow me to lay out my case for the affirmative. C1) Similar Interests The U.S. and Israel have morals, rights, and values that reflect each other. What is unique about Israel is that it holds values that are humane when compared with its neighboring countries. Israel has many of the same freedoms that are given in the U.S. Constitution, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly[1]. It can be described as a ""monument of democracy and stability in a region where's there's been little of either""[2]. Since the U.S. holds these values, rights, and morals as important, it has a reason to strengthen other countries such as Israel in order to promote them and keep them existent and alive in a world where rights are often abused. If we were to cut our support, Israel would be weakened and thus more likely to be overrun by surrounding Arab states that do not share these basic human rights. Saudi Arabia is regarded as one of the countries with the lowest political rights and civil liberties[3]. It along with Israel's neighbors, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine are all regarded as ""not free"" with limited rights in each. Saudi Arabia has serious problems with human trafficking, discrimination against women, lack of freedom of religion or speech, and executions of homosexuals[4]. Many of these things can be said for surrounding Arab theocratic states with severe problems. That being said, the strengthening and promotion of these interests are critical in the Middle East, and ought to be acknowledged by the U.S. through an alliance. Political influence has worked before, and can work with Israel and its neighboring countries too. C2) Peace One of the major goals of surrounding Arab countries is to destroy Israel. They have refused to negotiate on treaties and have allowed groups such as Hamas's organization to repeatedly launch rockets into Israel. The IDF has reacted with counter attacks as a means of self-defense, in order to keep Hamas's group away from their country. Israel has had a history of attempts to establish peace with help from the U.S. Their Declaration of Independence reads: "" We appeal in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months to the Arab inhabitants of the state of Israel, to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the state on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions. We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East. ""[5] In the past, there have been many attempts to establish peace from Israel, including Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979[6] and the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty in 1994[7]. The U.S. has historically encouraged these treaties and has made sure that both sides agree to them. However, these instances of peace often exist for short periods of time before violence erupts again. Since peace in the area is something that would be beneficial to everyone, Israel needs America's help through alliance to further work towards establishing peace with the help of Israel. They need the U.S.'s support to be that layer of stability in which a violent society is discouraged and peace is the top priority, as the U.S. has made in the past. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

Since the U.S. holds these values, rights, and morals as important, it has a reason to strengthen other countries such as Israel in order to promote them and keep them existent and alive in a world where rights are often abused. If we were to cut our support, Israel would be weakened and thus more likely to be overrun by surrounding Arab states that do not share these basic human rights.  Saudi Arabia is regarded as one of the countries with the lowest political rights and civil liberties[3]. It along with Israel's neighbors, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine are all regarded as ""not free"" with limited rights in each. Saudi Arabia has serious problems with human trafficking, discrimination against women, lack of freedom of religion or speech, and executions of homosexuals[4]. Many of these things can be said for surrounding Arab theocratic states with severe problems. That being said, the strengthening and promotion of these interests are critical in the Middle East, and ought to be acknowledged by the U.S. through an alliance. Political influence has worked before, and can work with Israel and its neighboring countries too.  C2) Peace  One of the major goals of surrounding Arab countries is to destroy Israel. They have refused to negotiate on treaties and have allowed groups such as Hamas's organization to repeatedly launch rockets into Israel. The IDF has reacted with counter attacks as a means of self-defense, in order to keep Hamas's group away from their country.  Israel has had a history of attempts to establish peace with help from the U.S. Their Declaration of Independence reads:  ""  We appeal in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months to the Arab inhabitants of the state of Israel, to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the state on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions.   We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East.  ""[5]  In the past, there have been many attempts to establish peace from Israel, including Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979[6] and the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty in 1994[7]. The U.S. has historically encouraged these treaties and has made sure that both sides agree to them. However, these instances of peace often exist for short periods of time before violence erupts again. Since peace in the area is something that would be beneficial to everyone, Israel needs America's help through alliance to further work towards establishing peace with the help of Israel. They need the U.S.'s support to be that layer of stability in which a violent society is discouraged and peace is the top priority, as the U.S. has made in the past.  [1]   http://www.state.gov...

I would urge that a closer examination of your definition necessitates the following: a leader is greater if the social influence he exerts is a product of his own will, and not due to external circumstances/luck. Simply put, any lucky events that help my goal during my leadership does not necessarily reflect good leadership on my part (just that I'm lucky, or what not). In that case, Hitler was a good leader because he had impressive oratory power, charisma, and a perfect moment for taking advantage of the German people due to the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, depression in 30's, etc. However, a large part of his success relies on the fact that the German people were particularly vulnerable -- at that point of time, many were out the streets looking for job, and in comes Hitler promising populist ideals and an idealized goal. Couple this with his charismatic public persona, and you have a nation quickly bowing down to his feet. While this is impressive in some ways, if the political and economic atmosphere of Germany were different (i.e. better), I suspect the outcome of the Nazi party and Hitler would be much more different, and insignificant. A counter example to your challenge of finding a ""better leader"" would be Alexander the Great. He is without a doubt of of the greatest military commanders, and his influence was immense (pushing Greek culture into foreign land, thus Hellenistic civilization).",1,TheSkeptic,"

Here are the lyrics. Walking alone 'cause the night is dead, Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge. Have you lost your mind, and your wrist got bruised, And you wanted better love Well, its sleeping your bedroom Hold on, stay by my side, don't go. If you could see me, whoever I am, It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones. So come on, love. (Come on, come on, come all and go) Na na na na na na na, I will not let you go. Now I'm walking alone, 'cause the night is dead. My feet don't glide like they did back then. When I called you up, so we could shoot the moon, These days I'm left to howl in tune But hearts do break And I must admit, I've got a better set of chords So I might've been fakin' it. I think I really only cried just once, and so If you could see me, whoever I am It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones. So come on love (come on, come on, come all and go) Na na na na na na na, I will not let you go. If you could see me, whoever I am It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones. Na na na na na na na, I will not let you go.

Since my opponent has no sources to back up his claims I won't give him the benefit of listing mine either. 1) My opponent focuses on the American lives saved, but admits higher casualties. Why does he suppose an American life is more important than any other race's life? Of course they might become insurgents, but so could anyone else, so by my opponent's logic we should kill the entire planet to wipe out insurgency. Further, my opponent fails to relize that one can conceal the entrance to an underground lair, thus thwarting the visual sensors of the drones. My opponent will never win the war on terror by this plan - if civilians become more bombed, more people hate United States, more people join Al Qaeda, simple as that! And you won't even be able to kill Al Qaeda because Al Qaeda knows where to hide, so really you'll just be doing free recruitment for Al Qaeda at a higher cost than it would to get rid of them, as foot soldiers have a proven history of doing. 2) When a terrorist does a suicide bombing, that is not cowardice, that is the ultimate bravery (or so it is percieved) because one has the courage to take up Jihad against the most powerful nation on Earth. If you do not show bravery in your fight, people in Iraq, Afghanistan etc will become angry at you, quit the army that NATO has created in these places and join the Taliban movement. Also, just to remind my opponent, the four years after the States killed al-Zarqawi were the deadliest for troops from that country, and all the martyr videos said the deaths were retribution for al-Zarqawi's death. Finally, my opponent thinks that by conquering all Al Qaeda territory he will conquer Al Qaeda. Not at all. Al Qaeda is a worldwide network, operating in many countries - from Australia to the United States to Uganda (though luckily not my native New Zealand). Osama himself has stated he is not to be found there, but ""amongst the Muslim masses."" 3) Every war is preventable. Take this one in Iraq. Solution - don't invade Iraq (who were clearly not more of a security threat than, say, Israel). Or the one in Afghanistan. Solution - stop the weapons trade with Israel (Al Qaeda has stated that if this happens, they will bring their leaders to the negotiating table). I challenge my opponent to cite a single inevitable war. If we could stop the Cold War from heating, we can stop any war. But this wasn't even my point! The United States, regardless of whether they are the strongest nation in the world or not, has no more right to start wars than any other country. This is guaranteed by international treaties that the United States has ratified. Future governments may begin to start wars at a whim if no human risk is involved. I'm sure my opponent can think where this is leading, three superpowers or so conquer Earth and the book ""1984"" by George Orwell plays out exactly. 4) OK, so we hold the pilots to account, or more accurately, those who failed to give them training in how to recognize the difference between a civilian and a soldier (which is impossible using a drone, meaning any use of a drone should result in prosecution). What difference does it make? It's still illegal. Hiroshima and Nagasaki was before the Geneva convention, which was written after World War 2 to prevent things like Hiroshima or NAZI war crimes from happening again. Like most laws it's not retrospective, so the bomber pilots have immunity. My opponent looks only to saving the lives of Americans whose job it is to put their life on the line for their country. What about innocents in far away lands who only wish to live in peace? Like I said, at least 207 of these people died in an attempt to kill just one Taliban leader using drones. More civilians died in just this one campaign than US soldiers died in all US campaigns over that whole year. If my opponent thinks he knows better than the CIA on piloting drones, I suggest he tries to tell that to them, not me. Drones are prone to failing and crashing, as well as misidentifying targets, not hitting underground targets, recruiting terrorists, proving United States cowardice, breaking the law and promoting a 1984-style world.

23,"I thank Con for their response. I will refute my opponents points. ""This fails to support Pro's position. Abortion isn't unlawful, and abortionists work without malice towards the products of conception."" The only decision made in the abortion process is that of the parents, more commonly that of the women, this gives no opportunity to the child decide their fate. It is solely the parents decision whether or not to carry out the abortion, thus the child has absolutely no say in the matter. "" That would be like having malice towards a piece of bread that you put in the toaster, or towards a lug nut as you tighten it. Does a doctor performing a tonsillectomy have malice toward the tonsils? It's a perfectly ridiculous idea."" ""Was it immoral to smuggle bibles into Russia? Was it immoral to smuggle slaves north out of Dixie?"" I understand that you are trying to make a connection to the above statements and the topic, but this is irrelevant. ""Again, this argument doesn't work in Pro's favor. Pro has no problem with murdering (in his view this is murder) the children of rape and incest victims. Therefore-even if we stipulated that abortion was murder, which we do not-Pro takes the position that murder isn't always wrong."" I stated a few exceptions can be made in the instance of rape and incest. Once again, a far more favorable option would be to allow a doctor to prevent the pregnancy, thus preventing the need for abortion all together. ""Would Pro call it murder to burn a photograph of a human? A parrot that talks like a human? Tonsils that have human DNA?"" You are misinterpreting my criteria for human characteristics. I suppose I mistyped that in some way. Human characteristics such as that of being alive. A heart beat would be an example, embryos clearly have been discovered to have heartbeats, thus being considered murder. ""Pro thinks that a few murders would be good, but he doesn't want too many? Whatever Pro's opinion is, whatever point he's trying to convey, he has not yet had success at getting his point across."" Once again, doctors can prevent pregnancies if instances of rape and incest occur. ""I don't know what the point of this is supposed to be.

I thank Con for their response.  
  
I will refute my opponents points.  
  
""This fails to support Pro's position. Abortion isn't unlawful, and abortionists work without malice towards the products of conception.""  
  
The only decision made in the abortion process is that of the parents, more commonly that of the women, this gives no opportunity to the child decide their fate. It is solely the parents decision whether or not to carry out the abortion, thus the child has absolutely no say in the matter.  
  
"" That would be like having malice towards a piece of bread that you put in the toaster, or towards a lug nut as you tighten it. Does a doctor performing a tonsillectomy have malice toward the tonsils? It's a perfectly ridiculous idea.""  
  
""Was it immoral to smuggle bibles into Russia? Was it immoral to smuggle slaves north out of Dixie?""  
  
I understand that you are trying to make a connection to the above statements and the topic, but this is irrelevant.  
  
""Again, this argument doesn't work in Pro's favor. Pro has no problem with murdering (in his view this is murder) the children of rape and incest victims. Therefore‒even if we stipulated that abortion was murder, which we do not‒Pro takes the position that murder isn't always wrong.""  
  
I stated a few exceptions can be made in the instance of rape and incest.  
Once again, a far more favorable option would be to allow a doctor to prevent the pregnancy, thus preventing the need for abortion all together.  
  
""Would Pro call it murder to burn a photograph of a human? A parrot that talks like a human? Tonsils that have human DNA?""  
  
You are misinterpreting my criteria for human characteristics.  
I suppose I mistyped that in some way.  
Human characteristics such as that of being alive.  
A heart beat would be an example, embryos clearly have been discovered to have heartbeats, thus being considered murder.  
  
""Pro thinks that a few murders would be good, but he doesn't want too many? Whatever Pro's opinion is, whatever point he's trying to convey, he has not yet had success at getting his point across.""  
  
Once again, doctors can prevent pregnancies if instances of rape and incest occur.  
  
""I don't know what the point of this is supposed to be. Is Pro backpedalling, implying that abortion is bad even in the case of rape and incest?""  
  
I am stating that in the cases of rape and incest a much more favorable option than abortion would be to prevent the pregnancy.

Do you need 2.7 Ghz of speed when you only use word and firefox? The answer is absolutely no. This point by my opponent is therefore moot because you can't judge a company by what kind of processors it uses. Also, the Core 2 Duo processor is NOT better than an i3 at processing. the i Series of processors is a significant jump from the Core 2 Duo processor. Even though they both have 2 PHYSICAL processors, which allows them to do two different things at the same time, the i3 has a feature called hyperthreading which allows it to run 2 processing threads on each core.

30,"Clarification The issue of whether we should treat each other well is an issue of human well-being, and therefore, is a human value. So yes, treating each other well is an issue of human well-being. I hope that satisfactorily answers Con's question. Argument P1 : Moral questions are about the well-being of conscious creatures. Well-being is a human value by the definitions made in Round 1. P2 : Well-being relates to physical states of the brain. P3 : Science can tell us what actions improve or hurt human human well-being. C : Science can determine human values. Premise One All moral questions are reducible to the well-being of conscious creatures. For instance, the moral issue of whether women should be forced to wear hijab is a question relating to well-being. Does it make human beings more compassionate to one another? Does it make life safer for the woman (prevented rape, etc)? Does it improve the woman and her mental health? These are all questions relating to the well-being of conscious creatures. We do not feel moral obligations to rocks or lightbulbs, as they are not conscious creatures. They are only inanimate objects. I suppose that one could argue that we have moral obligations to inanimate objects, but ultimately, that could be reduced to the well-being of conscious creatures as well. Due to the fact that humans only feel moral obligations to conscious creatures, it is becoming clear that the well-being of conscious creatures is the central point of morality. I understand that I have presented only one example of a case where a moral issue relates to the well-being of conscious creatures. Obviously, it is impossible to type out every moral question and then prove that it relates to the well-being of conscious creatures. Therefore, in order to refute this premise, I ask Con to present a moral issue that does not relate to the well-being of conscious creatures. Premise Two This claim is rather overt, unless one wishes to undermine a very fundamental aspect of modern day neuroscientific research. Neuroscience (italics are from 'The Compass of Pleasure' by David Linden) shows that when neurons in the region called the ventral tagmental area (VTA) are active, brief electrical impulses (called spikes) race from their cell bodies (located in the VTA proper) along long, thin information-sending fibers called axons. The axons have specialized structures at the endpoints called axon terminals. Some of the axon terminals of the VTA nuerons are located some distance away in a region called the nucleus acumbens. When the traveling electric spikes reach the axon terminals, they trigger the release of the neurotrantsmitter dopamine, which is stored in the terminals in the tiny membrane-bound blobs called vesicles. When a spike enters the axon terminal, it iniates a complex series of electrical and chemical events that result in the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the membrane of the axon terminal, thereby causing the contents the vesicle, including the dopamine neurons, to be released into a narrow fluid-filled space surronding the axon termal called the synaptic cleft. The dopamine molecules then diffuse and bind to specialized dopamine receptors on their target neurons, initiating a series of chemical signs therein. The experiments that cause the dopamine-containing neurons of the VTA to be active and thereby release dopamine in their targets will be felt as pleasurable, and the sensory cues and actions that preceded and overlped with those pleasurable experiences will be rememebred and associated with positive feelings. Neuroscientific research shows that states of the brain are responsible for our feelings of well-being, such as pleasure. I also wish to point out that the atatomy of a rat's pleasure circuit is very similar to that of our own. This brings experiments such as those done by psychologist B.F. Skinner with rats that found the reward circuits of their brain. The main point that I am making is that pleasure (and therefore well-being) has a neurological basis. Premise 3 I wish to bring us back to my earlier example in Premise 1 of women being forced to wear hijab. I gave an example of three questions we could ask if we were to try and discover what impacts compulsory hijab has on a woman and society. These questions all fall under the domain of scientific research. Scientific research can be conducted to investigate the affect that compulsory hijab has on compassion or the mental health of women who are forced to wear hijab. Science could also determine if wearing hijab makes one any else likely to get raped, and it can also tell us why people rape other people in the first place. That would also work to help us decide the affect of hijab on well-being. Science can also analyze the physical states of the brain, and determine if an action has harmed or improved the well-being of the subject. Conclusion The well-being of conscious creatures is the central point of moral questions and values. The well-being of conscious creatures is a human value. Well-being is sourced in the physical states of the brain. Science can tell us if actions improve well-being or not. Therefore, science can determine human values.

Secondly, why did the authors not show which region the spectra come from. This is an important question, as it leads to the fact that Fig 16 is doubtful as where Si is abundant, we also see that Fe and O are similarly abundant.

46,"Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections. My partner and I are on the con side. Our points are: 1. The Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. 2.there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts 3.Direct popular vote is flawed in many ways 4.The Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. My first point is the Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. According to Kristina Dell, ""with a direct popular vote...the selection of the president would often be the biggest, most populous states with little attention paid to smaller ones."" Without the Electoral College the voices of small states would be drowned out by the larger ones. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans says, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the Electoral College are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states."" The Electoral College is a necessity in order to give small states the right to have a voice in presidential elections. My second point is that there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts. As Professor Judith Best argues, ""an electoral system should produce a definite, accepted winner and avoid prolonged contests and disputes that create uncertainty and public turmoil."" This is the function now played by the Electoral College. To its defenders, it does so in two ways. One, it saves the nation ""from the effects of a vague outcome."" In this way, it confers the necessary legitimacy even in the face of close elections. And two, it also ""protects the nation from the crisis of a disputed election."" In a direct popular vote, during a close election, candidates will be too tempted to challenge every result. Whereas before if you carry a state by 10% there is no reason to challenge under the Electoral College, now a nationwide deadlock will ensure each state undergoes a recount. The judiciary committee once again explains, if one candidate contests a certain area, his opponent, to protect himself, warns of a contest where he thinks something might have been adverse to him. And in a little while, the whole electorate is involved. My third point is that direct popular vote is flawed in many ways. Proponents of a direct popular vote too often over simplify the question at hand. They fail to realize that, like any other system, direct popular vote will be vulnerable to numerous problems. One such problem is the increased threat of vote fraud. The Electoral College is a series of self-sealing containers, so that each state does not influence the outcome of another. If fraud occurs, it is isolated. In a direct election, however, each vote is of premium importance to the national decision. As such, agents within the election will have a far greater decision to influence votes. Consider an election that stays in an almost complete deadlock throughout the day. As word travels, the urgency of West Coast votes becomes so great that the temptation to commit fraud by local officials is overwhelming. The election is then illegitimate. The Electoral College avoids this because even if one county of one state commits fraud, it will not be enough to impact the overall election. (This is why I urge you to vote con) My fourth point is the Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. The cornerstone of democracy is not majority rule. It is reasonable majority rule with the protection of minority rights. A nation is far better served when moderate ideologies prevail. This government ensures liberty and equality maintain an optimal balance for all citizens. As former senator James Eastland writes, ""Because of winner-take-all (under the electoral system), a party is under a strong inducement to extend its platform as widely as possible within each State; it must expand its base of support to carry a popular plurality. Since both major parties face the same requirement, both must campaign in most of the same places before most of the same votes. Both must be hospitable to a wide range of minority interest which might otherwise be excluded from electoral competition."" This has so many great benefits, including reasonable polices that are widely appropriate in nature. Under a direct popular vote, no such system would hold. Candidates must currently be able to get a majority of votes in a statewide election to obtain even a single electoral vote. Ideologically extreme candidates are discouraged from running because they know they cannot appeal to that wide of an electorate. Under direct popular vote, however, there is no need to win statewide majorities and therefore elections will become crowded with extreme candidates.

He or she will be the voice of only a few. This is why I urge you to vote con",1,cyman,"
  
Direct popular vote should replace electoral vote in presidential elections. My partner and I are on the con side. Our points are:  
1. The Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections.  
2.there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts  
3.Direct popular vote is flawed in many ways  
4.The Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority.  
My first point is the Electoral College protects small states influence within the presidential elections. According to Kristina Dell, ""with a direct popular vote...the selection of the president would often be the biggest, most populous states with little attention paid to smaller ones."" Without the Electoral College the voices of small states would be drowned out by the larger ones. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans says, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the Electoral College are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states."" The Electoral College is a necessity in order to give small states the right to have a voice in presidential elections.  
My second point is that there is a far greater concern in direct popular vote is the problem of inevitable recounts. As Professor Judith Best argues, ""an electoral system should produce a definite, accepted winner and avoid prolonged contests and disputes that create uncertainty and public turmoil."" This is the function now played by the Electoral College. To its defenders, it does so in two ways. One, it saves the nation ""from the effects of a vague outcome."" In this way, it confers the necessary legitimacy even in the face of close elections. And two, it also ""protects the nation from the crisis of a disputed election."" In a direct popular vote, during a close election, candidates will be too tempted to challenge every result. Whereas before if you carry a state by 10% there is no reason to challenge under the Electoral College, now a nationwide deadlock will ensure each state undergoes a recount. The judiciary committee once again explains, if one candidate contests a certain area, his opponent, to protect himself, warns of a contest where he thinks something might have been adverse to him. And in a little while, the whole electorate is involved.  
My third point is that direct popular vote is flawed in many ways. Proponents of a direct popular vote too often over simplify the question at hand. They fail to realize that, like any other system, direct popular vote will be vulnerable to numerous problems. One such problem is the increased threat of vote fraud. The Electoral College is a series of self-sealing containers, so that each state does not influence the outcome of another. If fraud occurs, it is isolated. In a direct election, however, each vote is of premium importance to the national decision. As such, agents within the election will have a far greater decision to influence votes. Consider an election that stays in an almost complete deadlock throughout the day. As word travels, the urgency of West Coast votes becomes so great that the temptation to commit fraud by local officials is overwhelming. The election is then illegitimate. The Electoral College avoids this because even if one county of one state commits fraud, it will not be enough to impact the overall election.  
(This is why I urge you to vote con)  
My fourth point is the Electoral College creates a reasonable, moderate majority. The cornerstone of democracy is not majority rule. It is reasonable majority rule with the protection of minority rights. A nation is far better served when moderate ideologies prevail. This government ensures liberty and equality maintain an optimal balance for all citizens. As former senator James Eastland writes, ""Because of winner-take-all (under the electoral system), a party is under a strong inducement to extend its platform as widely as possible within each State; it must expand its base of support to carry a popular plurality. Since both major parties face the same requirement, both must campaign in most of the same places before most of the same votes. Both must be hospitable to a wide range of minority interest which might otherwise be excluded from electoral competition."" This has so many great benefits, including reasonable polices that are widely appropriate in nature. Under a direct popular vote, no such system would hold. Candidates must currently be able to get a majority of votes in a statewide election to obtain even a single electoral vote. Ideologically extreme candidates are discouraged from running because they know they cannot appeal to that wide of an electorate. Under direct popular vote, however, there is no need to win statewide majorities and therefore elections will become crowded with extreme candidates. This will further polarize politics as candidates make specific appeals to narrow voter interests. Then, the President will not be elected by a large body politic. He or she will be the voice of only a few.

3a. Evolution has never been observed. Science cannot function without empirical evidence, and we have never gathered any such evidence for evolution.

China's trade practices with the United States have resulted in a detrimental impact on jobs. Due to Chinese imports outweighing US exports, trade with China has resulted in a loss of nearly three million jobs between 2001 and 2010 [1], with some states, such as New Hampshire, losing over two percent of total state employment due to China [1]. It has been concluded that these lost jobs, especially in manufacturing, are almost entirely the fault of China [2], and not the US'. With this tremendous loss of jobs, it is abundantly clear that China negatively affects the economy of the US, especially in jobs. 2.) China's economic policies threaten the United States dollar. Recently, China has been buying a large amount of gold in an attempt to replace the US dollar as the world's reserve currency [3]. This, along with their goal of allowing the yuan, China's currency, to be traded freely would result in the weakening of the US dollar's dominance as the international reserve currency, making it more expensive for the US government to borrow money and to run perpetual trade and budget deficits [3]. 3.) The rise of China threatens the United States' national security. a.) Iran China has a close relation with Iran, using its powerful position in the United Nations to protect Iran from UN sanctions [4]. China is also investing in several oil programs in Iran [4], assisting Iran's economy, in turn funding programs that threaten the security of the US. This results in grave threats to the US' security and stability. b.) Cyber-attacks China currently contains several powerful telecommunications companies, which China has the means, opportunity and motive to use against the United States and commit espionage [5]. Several cyber-attacks against the United States have also been traced back to the United States [5], necessitating an urge to avoid these companies to avoid further attacks on America. Chinese actors are moving into increasingly advanced operations against specialized targets [6], which further threatens the United States' security. Since China threatens the United States economy by causing a tremendous loss of jobs as well as attempting to weaken the dollar as well as threatening national security through Iran and cyber-attacks, it is clear that the rise of China directly threatens the interests of the United States.

65,"Thank you, Bricheze, for accepting this debate. As my opponent is debating the pro/aff, she must be able to prove that retreating is not the better option in any scenario but one. I will first state my case, then move onto my opponent's I do not agree with the following statement of Stalin: ""Die, but do not retreat."" Retreat is defined as ""the forced or strategic withdrawal of an army or an armed force before an enemy"" - dictionary.com Arthur Wellesley, during Bonaparte's 100 day campaign, retreated from Quatre Bras to Waterloo in order for an easier win. If Wellesley had not retreated, Bonaparte would have most likely won. From a military standpoint, it was a better decision to retreat to Waterloo. This is a situation where it is better to retreat than to die. Another example from the Napoleonic Era involves the Russians. When Bonaparte marched into Russia with 500-600,000 men, the Russians retreated and applied a scorched earth policy. Bonaparte and his men went all the way to Moscow and got nothing as the city had been burnt down. Napoleon turned around at Moscow. The Russians suffered few casualties and the French army had been decimated to a mere 10,000. This is another situation where it is better to retreat than to die. The definition of retreat says that it can be for a strategic withdrawal. And as my two examples above show, it is better to retreat now and then for the purpose of strategy. From a less literal view, the statement ""die, but do not retreat"" is not always the wisest choice. For instance, when arguing with someone, and the facts say you are wrong, the wisest course of action is to concede defeat. If you know you are blatantly wrong, to continue arguing would be futile. It is not always about supporting your views. If you think it is right go ahead and believe it all you want, even if you cannot explain why you believe it, but in an argument give up and leave once you are proven wrong. ----------------------------------------------------My opponent's case-------------------------------------------------------------- My opponent agrees with the quote for the following reasons: 1) Retreating weakens you and strengthens the opposition 2) By being persistent you may outlast the opposition 3) The damage done to you as a result of persisting may cause the opposition to stop fighting 4) By persisting you become more memorable in history For the first reason my opponent claims that retreating is giving up and thus you lose a battle and your opponent has the better hand in the following battle. This is does not work because retreating can be used as a strategy. As I showed in my examples, retreating can be used to strengthen yourself rather than your opponent. And again, my opponent must prove the statement true in all situations. My opponent's second reason is something that has little opportunity of working. An army will most likely not run away because the other is ""scarier."" Rather, they would surrender or retreat to safety to decide on a better course of action. Proving your worth by fighting until the end is not a good incentive for the soldiers. If you go and tell your soldiers, to be remembered you must die, do you really think they would care to be remembered? I would think the answer would be ""no."" The soldiers will not do their best if this is their motivation. Now the three things my opponent says the opposition may realize: A) You will not back down, and they will either have to destroy you or leave you alone. If they went through the trouble of trying to kill you, then they will continue to try to kill you. And if they would attempt to destroy you, would that not be worse for you? By retreating you can regroup into a more effective attack. Which makes it harder for the opposition. B) You will do a lot of damage to their troops--raising the question: Is it worth it? But you are fighting to the death, in such a case the casualties lay more heavily on your side, meaning less damage to the opposition in the following attack. Worsening the situation does not benefit you. C) You are strong and will continue to fight until we are demolished or you die. Next time, they could come in larger numbers and be even more powerful, could we lose the next battle? Should we continue? This is basically B in other words. So the previous argument applies here as well. With larger numbers, it would be easier for you, but why would the opposition not have a larger army? You do not send out the whole army to one battle. The numbers will not matter too much. My opponent moves on to saying this is a useful tactic. But when it hurts you rather than help you, it cannot be useful unless you are trying to lose. For my opponent's last argument of proving yourself, becoming more memorable in history, I would like to bring back the incentive that this is supplying: ""to be remembered, you must die."" If this was true, I would not want to be remembered. I think that many people would agree with me on this as well. I await my opponent's response.",1,karththegeld,"

You misinterpreted. The dictionaries don't prescribe the universal death model because they don't make any prescriptions-- they just say, in essence, morality is morality, and don't go any further really in telling you what the word means :). It is they, not the ""universal death"" model that my statements don't contradict :). "". Instead it discusses Eudaimonia, commonly translated as happiness, but usually seen as having connotations with virtue and knowledge.he section referring to Aristotle says: ""Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty, pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial) friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental and/or unchanging is the best).Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However, unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure."" It sounds like the Aristotelian position supports the established version and if anyone is backing up my opponent it is the hedonist Epicurus.

"" My opponent seems here to be cheerfully condoning murder and rape as well as torture. Is he saying that if someone pushes you, you can murder them?"" Would it be conducive to one's life to attempt to murder someone every time they push you? I think not. Surely more egregious force would be required to practically justify such a retaliation. I was merely delineating the principle on which such an action would be automatically excluded from consideration.

""  
My opponent seems to have manoeuvred this debate away from a discussion of the rights and wrongs of water boarding (which he does not refer to once in round 2) and seems determined to defend his peculiar (if not ""bizarre"") idea of morality.""  
It's not steering the debate away from A to discuss X if A's truth or falsehood is dependent on X's truth or falsehood.  
  
""  
This would appear to basically consist of self-preservation with a slight touch of hedonism. It is an interpretation I am not really familiar with but sounds similar to the amorality (unconcerned with right and wrong) of Aleistair Crowley who's philosophy was ""do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.""""  
How is ""doing what thou wilt"" in any way similar to doing what will keep you alive and hopefully happy (alive being the first requirement)? Surely telling someone considering drugs to ""do what thou wilt"" isn't good for their life :).  
  
""  
I am glad that he feels his own interpretation (supposedly) backed up by his one cited source (Wikepedia) is superior to that of several reputable dictionaries and although this opinion radically redefines morality it is in fact not contradictory of the ""universal death"" model.""  
You misinterpreted. The dictionaries don't prescribe the universal death model because they don't make any prescriptions-- they just say, in essence, morality is morality, and don't go any further really in telling you what the word means :). It is they, not the ""universal death"" model that my statements don't contradict :).  
  
"". Instead it discusses Eudaimonia, commonly translated as happiness, but usually seen as having connotations with virtue and knowledge.he section referring to Aristotle says:  
""Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty, pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial) friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental and/or unchanging is the best).Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However, unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure.""  
It sounds like the Aristotelian position supports the established version and if anyone is backing up my opponent it is the hedonist Epicurus.  
""  
You missed the ""human flourishing"" part, the ""complete life"" part, the ""non-sacrificial"" part-- need I go on?  
  
""  
My opponent seems here to be cheerfully condoning murder and rape as well as torture.  
Is he saying that if someone pushes you, you can murder them?""  
Would it be conducive to one's life to attempt to murder someone every time they push you? I think not. Surely more egregious force would be required to practically justify such a retaliation. I was merely delineating the principle on which such an action would be automatically excluded from consideration.

76,"I would like to thank my opponent for his timely response. My opponent claims that the prisoner would not feel as much pain as they would in the electric chair. This is in fact, false. The electric chair happens very quick, and very fast. It is said by some that the person is dead before they can even feel anything. Also, the electric chair is not always what murderers get. Usually they get the lethal injection, or simply life in prison. On the other hand, you have no proof that the cannibals would not bring them any pain.

I would like to thank my opponent for his timely response. My opponent claims that the prisoner would not feel as much pain as they would in the electric chair. This is in fact, false. The electric chair happens very quick, and very fast. It is said by some that the person is dead before they can even feel anything. Also, the electric chair is not always what murderers get. Usually they get the lethal injection, or simply life in prison.  
  
On the other hand, you have no proof that the cannibals would not bring them any pain. But even if they did not, it would be a very good mental punishment. How would you feel if you knew you were going to be eaten in a few days. There would probably be less murders.

The controversy of the election started before the election. 1. Constitutionally illegitimate candidate: Daniel Ortega was violating the Nicaraguan constitution in both the term limits, and the running consecutive terms. In the Nicaraguan constitution it is stipulated that the president cannot run for more than two terms, and a president cannot run in consecutive terms. This is to prevent a dictatorial regime, and put a safeguard on the democratic process. Simply by running he is in violation of the country's constitution, and his blatant disregard for the rule of law, and the rule of the land is justification alone for a country that values the integrity of the electoral process to not acknowledge this man in his bid for re-election. [1] [Although the elections of the national seats that took place in this last election are also fraught with fraud, I will keep the argument to Daniel Ortega, since he is running as President, and it is he who the US Government would recognize.] It is key in understanding how Ortega has held and grown his control over the country, by understanding the role his party, the Sandinista Party his played in the country since he gained control. All possible judges, particularly Supreme Court Judges, and election officials are Sandinista, all police force and military forces are loyal to the Sandinistas over the Nicaraguan people. Sufficient branches of government and those with influence over the economy are loyal Sandinistas to facilitate Ortega's designs. 2. Fraudulent electoral process: The Ortega administration mandated, prior to the election, an identity card would be required for the election, and these cards would need to be obtained through members of the FSLN (Sandinista Party). Members of FSLN easily and quickly received their cards, whereas other requestors of the identity cards were waiting for a year or more. Essentially Ortega achieved an election that would be wholly managed by his party the Sandinistas, and two thirds of the places in Nicaragua were run by Sandinistas, and those that were not had the greatest instances of identity card rejection.[ 2] At the time of election the voter must present this identity card, and it must have an authorized stamp that the Sandinistas created. Without that stamp the identity card was invalid, and countless identity cards were found invalid because they did not have the proper stamp, all those people were not Sandinista. The incidents of fraud are too numerous to list, and was so rampant that it will never be truly documented. [3] The entire election was controlled and managed by the Sandinistas under the dictates of Daniel Ortega, for the benefit of Daniel Ortega's reelection and total control over the Nicaraguan people. [4] 3. Impact of fraudulent election in Nicaragua: With a total disregard to the constitution in the running of Daniel Ortega as president violating the constitution, and the principles that safe guard its people from a dictator he degrades the constitution in its intended purpose of providing a democratic rule of checks and balances over the land. What is even more important to note is that if a president is elected with more than 50% of the popular vote he is empowered to change the constitution as he sees fit. This is a massive coup of power to the presidency, and by illegally obtaining that number of votes he has effectively taken control of all aspects of governance within the country. It is a true theft of total power with the obvious intentions of a dictatorial regime in perpetuity. It is also important to understand the corruption within the Ortega regime, and the personal corruption of the man. He has become one of the richest men in Central America, leader of the second poorest countries in the hemisphere.

So while Pro figures that a tax will provide a good stream of revenue to other programs, it'll actually decrease the stream of revenue because less people will buy the product. The price elasticity of demand measures whether a 1% increase in price leads to a greater than 1% decrease in demand for it. If it exceeds a 1% loss in demand, total revenue will fall and they'd have been better off not increasing the price at all. Fast food consumers are extremely sensitive to increases in price. They have a dollar menu at practically every fast food establishment. Cheap food is a hallmark of the unhealthy food industry. The whole target market for this industry would be alienated with the introduction of a new tax. Total revenue would fall substantially.

As of now, our progress toward achieving AI is roughly equivalent to the progress the first man to climb a tree made towards landing on the moon.

101,"I was involved in a rather unpleasant incident on a British Airways flight from Aberdeen to Heathrow recently. (1) The aircraft was an Airbus A319 with a single economy (coach) class cabin which was fitted with seats with a width of 17.0"" (2) and the aisle seat I was allocated was located next to a grossly overweight gentleman, whose considerable girth was overflowing onto my seat, thus preventing me from putting the armrest down or fastening my seatbelt. I therefore challenged the man and here is the gist of the ensuing confrontation: Me: Excuse me, you appear to be sitting on part of my seat, would you be kind enough to move over so I can sit down? Overweight Passenger: I'm sorry, but I'm as far over as I can get. Me: Then may I suggest you move somewhere else where there are two free seats together? Overweight Passenger: Well, I don't think there are any left. If only they made the seats bigger there wouldn't be a problem. Me: Well the seats seem big enough for everybody else and the fact is, there is a problem and that problem is that I paid over two hundred and fifty quid for a seat that is being partly occupied by a great sweating pile of flab, so what are you going to do about it, pieface? Overweight Passenger: Well, if you are going to take that attitude... Me: Yes I am going to take that attitude - I think I'm entitled to under the circumstances, don't you? I mean how much money did you contribute towards the cost of my seat? That's right, not a penny. So what makes you think you are entitled to sit on part of it then, eh? At this juncture a stewardess came up and asked if she could help so I politely explained the situation and asked her to displace the overweight passenger so that I could duly take my seat. However, she said that the plane was full and suggested that I take a jump seat instead. Naturally, I refused to sit on a tip-up seat at the front of the cabin being stared at by the rest of the passengers like I was some naughty schoolboy who'd been told to stand in the corner of the classroom as a punishment - what, just so that some greedy fat bloke could sit in the seat that I'd paid over 250 for? I don't think so! By then, the plane's engines were being wound up and the aircraft was clearly ready to push back from the gate. The stewardess started to get really anxious then because all passengers must by law be seated with belts fastened while the plane is taxiing, so she went into the cockpit. She reappeared a minute or two later, and said to me that she was very sorry, but since I was last on board the captain had instructed her to offload me and explained that the ground crew would rebook me onto the next available flight, unless I was willing to take a jump seat, of course. I suggested that it might be more appropriate, all considered, for the oversized gentleman whose blubber was spilling all over my seat to get the naughty chair, but she was afraid that jump seats were not designed to accommodate people of his size. So, given that the flight was only an hour and a half long, I reluctantly strapped myself into the jump seat and resigned myself to an uncomfortable journey watching old Five Bellies lolling around on my seat, scoffing airline grub and guzzling down bottle after bottle of complimentary booze. To my mind, there is something fundamentally unjust about people of normal weight having to make sacrifices for the fat on planes. After all, 99% of people who are overweight are so because they are greedy and lazy, not because they have some medical condition. (3) When I got back, I visited British Airways' website to check what their policy on seating the fat is. This is what it says: ""British Airways offers its customers the ability to book an extra seat. There are many reasons why a customer might book an extra seat, the most common are for...Personal comfort - The customer requires more space than one seat provides, due to oversize..."" (4) You will note that booking an extra seat is merely an option - it's not compulsory. However, it's a whole different ball game when it comes to baggage. If your hand luggage exceeds certain dimensions and cannot fit into the cradle at check-in, you are obliged to check it into the hold - which is something many airlines now charge for. (5) Surely the same principle should be applied to fat passengers? If they are unable to fit into a cradle measuring the dimensions of a seat, they should be made to pay for two seats or otherwise be refused boarding. Thank you.

Their bodies twisted and mutated to produce extremely unstable chemicals, infested soldiers long only to find the Swarm's enemies and destroy them by detonating their own bodies in a cloud of toxic fluid. As with other Zerg ground units, an Infested Terran also has the ability to Burrow. The Infested Terrans have the capability to inflict up to 500 points of explosive splash damage to any unit or structure. To reach their full destructive potential, an Infested Terran must be commanded to target a specific unit or structure, but they can also be commanded to target an area within the proximity of several units or structures. The splash damage from the exploding Infested Terran will cause massive damage to all nearby targets. Thus once again the zerg have the advantage over terran because they can turn terran into suicide bombers working for them. Zerg also have the lurker. Lurkers emit waves of supra-dense spines against their enemies and actually burrow under the ground. Once underground, a Lurker can utilize a series of spines that rip up through the ground in a straight line from the Lurker to its target. These spines continue to their maximum attack range, regardless of where the targeted unit lies within that path and every enemy unit in the path of the spines will take damage. If he decides to take his base and move it I can attack with Mutalisks. The Mutalisk serves as the basic flying support unit for the Zerg and has the ability to strike both air and ground targets. The Scourge are the zerg actual kamikaze units and explode killing air/ground people. So, whether the terran base decides to pick up and move I can attack it. So, I can rush or wait later in the game and I will end up winning because the zerg have superior units, can be used by new players, can be used quickly by rushing, and overall destroy the terran.",1,Justinisthecrazy,"

104,"I thank my opponent for his response. First off, my opponent is quick to state the good deeds Lady GaGa does for the gay community. Now, if we were talking about Lady GaGa as a person or for her stances on the issues that matter, we'd be having a different conversation entirely. However, we are not arguing on that basis. The debate is solely about the impact of her music and her music alone, the message it delivers and the reactions that it provokes, not the outside factors that help contribute to her image that have nothing to do with her music. I intend to focus on music an lyrics alone. Second, my opponent admits in his OWN argument that her lyrics are shallow. I would now like to delve deeper into some of those lyrics. Here are a few highlights from the song 'Just Dance': ""I've had a little bit too much All of the people start to rush... "" ""Can't find my drink or man. Where are my keys, I lost my phone..."" ""I love this record baby, but I can't see straight anymore... Keep it cool what's the name of this club? I can't remember but it's alright, alright."" Now, these are only the highlights from the first verse alone. From these, three things can be determined: 1. She's had too much to drink 2. From this intoxication from, assuredly, alcohol, she has lost her date, glass, keys, and phone 3. Is so drunk she can't see straight 4. Doesn't remember where she is, let alone see 5. All of this is okay. While all of these things mentioned certainly do happen, I do not believe that they have a certainly good message. For instance, according to <URL>... : ""...Similarly, approximately one-half of all sexual assault victims report that they were drinking alcohol at the time of the assault, with estimates ranging from 30 to 79 percent..."" Which, according to Gaga, is okay. But why let me argue this when she can? For instance, in continuation with the lyrics: ""Just dance. Gunna be okay. Da-doo-doo-doo Just dance. Spin that record babe. Da-doo-doo-doo Just dance. Gunna be okay. Duh-duh-duh-duh Dance. Dance. Dance. Ju-just dance."" See? Everything' s fine! Until ... ""Wish I could shut my playboy mouth. How'd I turn my shirt inside out? Inside out babe. Control your poison babe Roses with thorns they say. And we're all gettin' hosed tonight. What's go-ing out on the floor? "" This stanza seems to implicate that Gaga, even though she has a date, is still insisting on getting naked for, well, it seems, almost no reason at all except to, well, get naked... ...as evidenced by the next stanza, where she says... ""When I come through on the dance floor checkin out that catalogue. Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw. And I ain't gonn' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like the car I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it and flex until the til done until tomorr' yeah. Show me I can see that you got so much in the jean The way you twirling up them hips round and round There's no reason, I know why you can't leave here with me In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down."" See! Even she says that there need be no reason at all! According to the Center for Disease Control, there were 1,210,523 cases of Chlamydia observed in 2008. There were also 336,742 cases of gonorrhea observed in 2008. Most of us know that these diseases are contracted by having sex without protection and, in this case, just for the sake of it. So, according to Lady Gaga, this action, which causes a more likely chance to contract a disease such as Chlamydia or gonorrhea, is acceptable, and, through her lyrics, is telling the listening community that it is acceptable. This is a woman in the forefront of the news and yes, unbelievably, music industry. A role model. And Lady GaGa says it is okay to take un-necessary chances just for a good time. Also, she's, according to her lyrics, psychotic: ""I'm psychotic synchypnotic I got my blue burners and phonic I'm psychotic synchypnotic I got my brand electronic"" That, normally. isn't good.

Admit impediments. Love is not love  
Which alters when it alteration finds,  
Or bends with the remover to remove:  
O no; it is an ever-fixed mark,  
That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;  
It is the star to every wandering bark,  
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.  
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks  
Within his bending sickle's compass come;  
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,  
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.  
If this be error and upon me proved,  
I never writ, nor no man ever loved. ""  
  
now this poem by dean is full of more longing more passion more love than this boring sonnet 116

""Breathe thy hot breath into my ear  
Breathe thy hot breath that I can hear the pounding of thy heart for I to hear thy soul cry out for I  
Linger on my neck  
Linger on my neck with thy soft kiss kiss my neck with the soft touch of thy soul linger linger and sigh out thy soul o""er the flesh of I with thy soft kiss breathe out thy love for I from the soul of thine warm my flesh burn my flesh with the hot passion of thine  
Oh oh give me thy soul along the flesh of I give me thy soul to make my eyes to cry my love for thee oh come beloved and make my heart to thud and my veins to sing with thy lips make my ears ring with the love thee does to I do bring oh oh ever so slowly run thy lips o""er the neck of I kiss dabbing dab dab dabbing """,Arts,0,This-must-be-the-greatest-love-poem-ever/1/,67928
107,"In my opponent's argument he tried to explain that specific people, have with certain actions lost the the unalienable, most basic and most important right for a peaceful democratic society, the right to live. I clearly am against this theory and here is why: A.) Me and my opponent live in democratic countries and all democratic societies are based on 3 UNALIENABLE rights, that me and my opponent have sworn to protect as citizens of these countries, these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness with life being the most valuable of the three. Notice that these rights are considered unalienable and can't be taken away. So taking life away is schizophrenic after agreeing not to and is against our law, beliefs and principles no matter what we believe about the death penalty and such ides are against democracy itself. B.) Also, killing a man/woman to convince others not to kill is absurd. C.) Instead of depriving this human being of his/her right to live you can put them in prison this more effective than the brutal action of killing for many reasons. First of all, the criminal is still punished severely for his acts and perhaps even in a worse way than death would punish him (many prisoners in Europe have asked to be killed). Also, it keeps him away from society, thus keeps everyone safe from him/her almost as effectively as killing him/her and scares other potential criminals and keeps them from repeating this act, just as well as the death penalty. Additionally, it is less brutal and violent, thus it suits our modern society better than killing. Also it can be reversed unlike killing in case of a miracle that somehow proves the victim innocent..Additionally, one has to keep in mind that a person who committed an act bad enough to be executed for it is definitely ill. His problems were caused by society and society should be the one to correct them. This human should be given a chance to overcome his problems and not be killed because of them. This person has a need to be accepted again he needs to feel useful and that there is a chance for him to be forgiven. My opponent also asked why this man or woman should continue living. The answer to this is simple. Above I have proved that: A.) First of all, he has a right to life , a right given to him by his Creator (Declaration of Independence) and no human has a right to rob him of that right because then he/she will be just as bad as the criminal. B.) Life has taught us that nothing is definite. So this man needs to stay alive just in case evidence, after his conviction proves him innocent. C.) His problems should be corrected and he/she has to be accepted again. If a better punishment has been(special prison) has been thought of, and if the criminal benefits while it makes no difference to anyone else's interests ,and the death penalty is an old, brutal, unethical method and is accepted by fewer countries as the years go by, then why in the name of god should we go against our own beliefs as citizens of democratic countries and act as badly as plain murderers and kill in order to punish killing and sentence a human being that just maybe despite all odds be found innocent later to death???",1,liberty,"

109,"Those are some interesting arguments. A note on base-systems (for readers): Base systems are basically how we count. Our current system is base on tens, hence the name 'ten-based'. This is so because we have 10 digits ""0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"". The digit in the 'ones' place tells us how many single units there are, the 'tens' place how many tens etc. So 23 tells us we have 3 ones and 2 tens. Now, what if we switched to the two-base system called binary? To start, we only have two digits: 0 and 1. The first digit still tells us how many ones we have, but the second tells us how many twos we have, the third tells us fours, the fourth tells us eight etc. So in binary, 1 is what we know as 1, but 10 is what we know as 2 (we have zero 1s and one 2). 11 is three, 100 is 4, 101 is 5, 110 is 6, and so on.

Terrorists are not scared of death and will commit suicide for their cause, and will use any means to kill. They will use deadly weapons to achieve these means. The reason terrorists are able to obtain weapons such as RPG's and road side bombs and IED's is because they are being funded by corrupt people and corrupt government officials.

He is directly funding the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia), who are heavily involved in drug trafficking, and kidnapping, murdering, and use IED's to destroy towns. A computer was recovered on a Columbian military raid, the computer owned by Ral Reyes (second in command of the FARC) documents show ties between Ecuador and also shows Chavez directly funded the FARC 300 million dollars. The money was going to be used to purchase uranium for nuclear weapon development. Venezuelan authorities have let the FARC drug traffic run freely through their country an estimated 300 tons annually to be exported to the US and Europe, A very profitable agreement between the FARC and Chavez.

These cards help terrorists come across the US border and will soon strike in not only American cities but in cities around the world. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez spent over $2.17 billion in 2005 to acquire Russian assault rifles and helicopters, Spanish transport aircraft and missile-capable corvettes, and Brazilian turboprop light attack aircraft. Chavez also bought 100,000 AK-103 and AK-104 assault rifles that were delivered in 2006. On Feb. 4, however, Chavez said that ""100,000 rifles are not enough,"" and declared that many more rifles are needed to arm his one million-strong military reserve, that's another 900,000 rifles to buy. The Chavez government's shopping list for 2006 includes MiG-29 Fulcrums, possibly Sukhoi SU-27 Flankers, and air defense missiles, including both man-portable and vehicle-mounted SAMs. Chavez said in 2005 that he would buy up to 50 MiG-29 Fulcrums in a deal worth up to $5 billion.

115,"Oooohh this just got serious! Thank you for your arguments, Pro. R1. ""My opponent claims that women wrestling would be ""lame to watch"" because they are ""done"" with physical activities. This is absolutely untrue. My opponent brings up a faulty claim without evidence. Growing mature wouldn't cause women to lose interest in physical activities. This is why professional female soccer players, tennis players, and wrestlers exist (these are only couple of examples). Women still have interest in sports. Women, like men, enjoy physical activities."" I am a woman too. I do a ton of physical activities (sports). But I am thirteen. I have not fully grown in my physical body futures!!! I play every sport (basketball, softball/baseball, tennis, volleyball, soccer) except wrestling (and boxing and Lecross). Main reason is because I don't want to hurt anything. Sure, you get hurt playing basketball, but the goal of the game is not to tear someone to the ground. I'd like to mention that Pro is 14 according to his profile, she should know what I mean. Secondly I'd like to make it known that women wrestling is considered awful, even by pro people on a wrestling forum. Read what they say here: [1] Too physical means awkwardly weird and the sport is generally (and obviously) uncomfortable for everyone, the spectators and the players! [2], [3] R2. ""Additionally, Women Wrestling is actually quite popular. A YouTube video called, ""Top 10 Female Wrestlers,"" currently has over 17 million views and 23,000 likes! [1] Many people actually enjoy spectating female wrestling because it is fun and exciting. On the other hand, sewing has no intense rivalries and matches. Watching someone sew is clearly not exciting."" YouTubers say nothing on the scale of popularity. Admit it, whenever you watch a video you are either bored or have to do it for education (school). A YouTube video has no say in this debate because it doesn't prove that women wrestling is entertaining, in fact if anything, it proves against your proposition. It is lame and not useful in any way. R3. ""There are approximately 237,868 victims of sexual assaults, each year. [3] Female wrestling might actually decrease the amount of sexual assaults. If women were to learn wrestling, they would be capable of defending themselves from rapists."" I doubt that.

""Yes, men might earn a few dollars from stitching and selling their products. Don't forget that professional female wrestler would earn more money.

Wrestling is dumb because it just gives females in a better position in money, but is that good for anyone? All those people who pay to see lame performance of women wrestling and then they have less money! If men sewed more they would not only provide for themselves but it would give resources (clothing and accessories) to others.

Oooohh this just got serious! Thank you for your arguments, Pro.  
  
R1. ""My opponent claims that women wrestling would be ""lame to watch"" because they are ""done"" with physical activities. This is absolutely untrue. My opponent brings up a faulty claim without evidence. Growing mature wouldn't cause women to lose interest in physical activities. This is why professional female soccer players, tennis players, and wrestlers exist (these are only couple of examples). Women still have interest in sports. Women, like men, enjoy physical activities.""  
I am a woman too. I do a ton of physical activities (sports). But I am thirteen. I have not fully grown in my physical body futures!!! I play every sport (basketball, softball/baseball, tennis, volleyball, soccer) except wrestling (and boxing and Lecross). Main reason is because I don't want to hurt anything. Sure, you get hurt playing basketball, but the goal of the game is not to tear someone to the ground. I'd like to mention that Pro is 14 according to his profile, she should know what I mean. Secondly I'd like to make it known that women wrestling is considered awful, even by pro people on a wrestling forum. Read what they say here: [1] Too physical means awkwardly weird and the sport is generally (and obviously) uncomfortable for everyone, the spectators and the players! [2], [3]  
  
R2. ""Additionally, Women Wrestling is actually quite popular. A YouTube video called, ""Top 10 Female Wrestlers,"" currently has over 17 million views and 23,000 likes! [1] Many people actually enjoy spectating female wrestling because it is fun and exciting. On the other hand, sewing has no intense rivalries and matches. Watching someone sew is clearly not exciting.""  
YouTubers say nothing on the scale of popularity. Admit it, whenever you watch a video you are either bored or have to do it for education (school). A YouTube video has no say in this debate because it doesn't prove that women wrestling is entertaining, in fact if anything, it proves against your proposition. It is lame and not useful in any way.  
  
R3. ""There are approximately 237,868 victims of sexual assaults, each year. [3] Female wrestling might actually decrease the amount of sexual assaults. If women were to learn wrestling, they would be capable of defending themselves from rapists."" I doubt that. As you said, women have already started wrestling, but it is most definitely not the same as men's wrestling. There are better sports that could teach self defense, but wrestling would not do that well. Women should take Karate or something, instead!

Once Brittan had fallen and was under Nazi control then all Hitler had to do was build up his military bigger and all his resources and wait for the Japanese to finish up with the pacific, which brings me to my next point Pearl Harbor.

118,"CON Many economists argue that raising the minimum wage won't alleviate poverty and would shake an already fragile economy. We can raise the minimum wage to $11 but if no one chooses to hire people or hires fewer people then we have effectively raised unemployment. Alan Reynolds is a senior fellow with the Cato Institute and an expert on wage policy. He says that employers would likely chose to scale back jobs. Increasing the minimum wage could result in a lot of people who have been earning the minimum wage earning less than the minimum wage. How is that possible? Mall employers, farmers, lots of occupations are exempt from the minimum wage. So the last time we raised the minimum wage, lo and behold, the percentage earning less than the minimum wage rose to 4.2 percent of the wage and salary workers - three million. You basically have more people trying to compete for grape-picking jobs, or working in selling hot dogs in the street or day laborer or babysitting and that sort of thing. Fast food restaurants typically pay more than the minimum wage. When you talk minimum wage, it's really entry-level, and it's usually young people trying to get that first job. And if they do pretty well, three months, six months down the road, they get a little raise. That would effectively end if employers are starting people at $11. Actually there really aren't very many people who are working full time who are poor according to Reynolds. Maybe one percent. People are poor very often because they can't work for one reason or another. Disability, unemployment, so on and so forth. Obviously, doing something that will raise unemployment isn't going to help poverty. People who can't get work at 7.25 an hour aren't going to find work at 11.00 an hour. By such a dramatic jump they know there'd be a big hike in youth unemployment. The youth wouldn't get the experience they need to get the second job, which is a better job. And it's just basically a bad idea all the way around. To push the minimum wage to $11.00 at a time when the economy is facing high energy prices and rising inflation seems outrageous to me. I think it's probably a very bad idea to try to help the poor by raising prices. Liberal arguments for increasing the minimum wage have a fundamental flaw: They restrict the set of policy choices to either a minimum wage increase or doing nothing. That means they overlook the single most important federal policy for the poor: the Earned Income Tax Credit. The EITC is a measure in the federal tax code to support the living standards of the poor without creating a ""welfare trap"" by diminishing the incentive to work. Economists widely consider the credit a success for reducing poverty while increasing employment. Created in 1975, the credit has been successively expanded in five times since. It is now the nation's largest anti-poverty transfer program. In its latest iteration, for families with two or more children, the credit is 40 percent of the first $10,750 of earned income. After earned income exceeds $15,040, the credit is phased out at a rate of 21.06 cents per marginal dollar, and it goes away fully at the point when earned income reaches $35,458.

UIL, athletic and other classes are not a part of this required curriculum, but electives that students may choose to take.  
  
Ultimately Pro has shown evidence detailing how US schools are in poor standing with other countries, but never doing away with extracurricular activities will solve this problem. On the other hand, I show that involvement in UIL readies kids for college as well as motives them to focus more on their studies.

While I'd be willing to admit that there are limits to a person's rights this does not essentially prove that gay marriage should be limited or prevented. One of the first lessons I learned in a law class is that ""a person is entitled to their rights as long as it does harm anyone else's rights."" What this means is you have the burden to prove that gay marriage harms other peoples' rights in order to warrant limitation or removal. Lets group that argument with the only offense you provide saying that the gay community is heavily inflitrated by drugs. First I would argue that even IF this was proven true, it has not harmed anyone but themselves. Second, it has nothing to do with why gays should be allowed to marry. And third, in the city of Los Angeles where that article was published, there is one of the highest crime rates in the nation. This means that any reliability from studies of crime would have a very large margin of error since it could not translate into smaller cities and towns. Now let me revisit the argument I provide saying that gay nieghborhood have a lower crime rate. The article I quoted had to deal with the West Village neighborhood, which is one of the largest gay communities in the nation next to San Fransico. It has reliable data because it surveyed 1920 people who lived in that area of Manhattan and the reported crime rate was extremely low.

It prevents civil unions, comprehensive domestic partnerships and removes existing legal benefits. There are about 360,000 unmarried couples in the state according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which there are roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples."" What this shows is that not only will the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment prevent gay and lesbian couples from having any form of legal union but also takes away and existing legal benefits they possess. The significance this argument has to this debate is that it shows that my opponent is providing a significant harm to the roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples in the state that could otherwise be avoided by voting no. Next, extend my second Nadine Smith argument which states, ""When Michigan took away domestic partnerships it didn't make married relationships any better, but what it did do is remove the benefits that gay couples had and made it alot harder for them to care for their families and the ones that they love.""

My opponent does not dispute that Israel has attempted peace several times in the past, thus conceding that it has. After the conflict over the Sinai territory in the 70's that Israel had taken, it offered Egypt the entire peninsula in exchange for peace. Egypt agreed, and peace was made. This is an astounding example of the measures that Israel will go to in order to keep peace between the nations[3]. 2. Con drops my point about the U.S. being a stabilizing force of peace through an alliance and instead tries to find two isolated actions of the IDF he finds ""unjust"". This is irrelevant as it ignores the bigger picture and has nothing to do with my actual argument. Con's Case Paramilitary groups 1. My adversary is supposed to be arguing that the status quo should be changed, as in the alliance should be cut, not that it should never have existed. Any points that he makes in support of the latter should be ignored as they are irrelevant to the resolution. Such points include militant groups that he suspects were formed because of America's support for Israel. 2. Con seems to be hinting that if the U.S. cut support with Israel then militant groups such as Al Qaeda would either die off or stop rising up against it. This is very far from the truth. If the U.S. cut its support, Israel would be rendered more vulnerable to terrorist groups such as Hamas and Al Qaeda, which is the exact opposite of what we want. Thus it is more logical for America to hold fast with Israel as it is set up for potential destruction. Cost This is actually quite minor of a point because it hinges on whether or not the alliance with Israel is worth keeping or not. If I can show that that the alliance is a net benefit, then a reader must agree that more lives saved is better than a few more dollars paid. This point doesn't really show how giving aid to another country is a bad thing unless we all assume that the alliance is pointless, which I have shown that it isn't. America's funding of Israeli military and the IDF is crucial for the protection and survival of its citizens.

Last night, at dinner my father slipped cyanide in my berry berry strawberrylitiouse drink. Not enough to kill me, just to hospitalize me. So anyway I take a drink of my super ungirly drink, and as I expect unconditional delitiosness to come flowing into my mouth, I instead start wrenching on the table. Foaming at the mouth, seizures, I mean the whole nine yards. And my father isn't the only one, when this happened, everyone at the table was laughing. Some of my brothers got on top of me while I was having a seizure, and pretended I was a bucking bull. Also what you said about 4 brothers is wrong. I have 17 1/2.

To have ones life be so unbelievably shittty, that he tries to kill his or her self, but no matter how HARD HE TRIES, HE CANT.  Here are my reasons why my life is more sucky than my opponents:  1. It's all a show     My father, the king, hates me. In public he makes it look like I have an amazing life, so no one will suspect. It's the perfect crime. However I suffer from severe child abuse. Last night, at dinner my father slipped cyanide in my berry berry strawberrylitiouse drink. Not enough to kill me, just to hospitalize me. So anyway I take a drink of my super ungirly drink, and as I expect unconditional delitiosness to come flowing into my mouth, I instead start wrenching on the table. Foaming at the mouth, seizures, I mean the whole nine yards. And my father isn't the only one, when this happened, everyone at the table was laughing. Some of my brothers got on top of me while I was having a seizure, and pretended I was a bucking bull. Also what you said about 4 brothers is wrong. I have 17 1/2.

134,"Thank you, Pro. My opponent struggles, in this round, to differentiate between the two meanings of the word ""must"". In the first contention, Pro suggests that John Gay's version of utilitarianism is not justified, and therefore does not prove the resolution false. This contends with the lack of an argument for utilitarianism which does recognize the happiness of animals. Pro simply never gives any proof for why utilitarianism which considers animal happiness is valid. Instead, all other arguments have been centered on whether or not utilitarianism which does not consider animals are self-consistent. John Gay's utilitarianism is entirely theologically based, and it is based on a from of Christianity. He simply did not have to prove the existence of his God or that his theory was true for the idea to be self-consistent. He was a utilitarian, and his brand of the normative ethics did not need to consider the happiness of animals. ""For example, he believed that ""beauty"" was an intrinsic good. A beautiful object had value independent of any pleasure it might generate in a viewer"" [1]. G.E Moore disagreed with the idea that beauty was subjective. The viewers of beauty, including animals, did not contribute to the ideal. This is another example of a self-consistent utilitarian ideology that does not need to consider the happiness of animals. What I suspect may be an argument for the brand of utilitarianism my opponent is suggesting, is the example of patriarchal views, My opponent suggests that since men learned to treat women as their equals, humans can learn to treat animals as our equals; thus my opponent suggests that women are to men as animals are to women. What this achieves, is to suggest that holding animal's happiness as less than animal's happiness is simply unjustified. My opponent gives no evidence for this idea, but the conclusion nonetheless remains irrelevant. The two brands of utilitarianism which I covered earlier do not become any less consistent with this assumption. Gay's reason for promoting human happiness was specifically due to his position on God's relationship to humankind. Moore's ideology promoted beauty completely independently from the pleasure that it caused. Pro's attempt to ""destroy"" my argument falls flat in more ways than one. The first being that beauty remains independent from happiness. The second being that it is an attempt to misconstrue the resolution. Utilitarianism ""must recognize animal's happiness"" in so far as its core beliefs are applied to animals. What the resolution suggests, is that the ""greatest happiness for the greatest number"" refers to the happiness of animals. Saying that the animals have an indirect role in that is not relevant. Consider my opponent's rule, as well as the rest of the debate so far: Semantic arguments are not allowed, and the entirety of the debate suggests that this argument is no more than that. Considering the happiness of animals clearly refers to accepting animals as a part of that greatest ""number"". I urge the floor to simply disregard this rebuttal. In conclusion, Utilitarianism does not need to take into account the happiness of animals. It is true that most varieties must, but the argument supporting the claim that all have to is borderline nonexistent.

So he has a right to live although he has lost the right to be free. Despite that, he deserves punishment and needs to be kept away from others because he is dangerous and jail does both. Finally it prevents future crime because people fear a life in prison, this is surely not as threatening as the death penalty but if a life in jail with lousy food and conditions, until death doesn't scare the potential criminals than I don't think death will either.

While I admit that there are many athletes of foreign nature respected in our country, this is not quite so with musicians, and there is a huge difference between both. A sport is a past-time, something we use for entertainment to excite ourselves. But music, is the gateway to the human soul. Through music we find our inner selves, and find what morals and aspects we have. Being one people in one nation, it only makes sense we would try to have the same ideas and thoughts. But these foreign musicians impose THEIR ideas upon us. This is slowly destroying our nation's values. Most would say that it is our values that made us great and keep us great. Without them, we are doomed. 2. He is attacking the Jonas Brothers. The opponent fails to recognize the fact that one person will often do what his or her friends do. So when one person starts liking Bieber everyone does. This forces millions of young girls everywhere to turn away from the J-Bros and to Bieber, completely unwillingly. 3. His voice is annoying. Seeing as there are 6,692,030,277 in the world and opponent stated that only 137,000 copies sold in the first week this means that only 1 person bought per every 49,000 people. Obviously a vast majority of people agree his voice is quite irritating. 4. He is destroying America's youth. The fact that other people are corrupting America does not make Justin Bieber any more in the right. You say he is tasting girls lip-gloss, and act as if this is O.K. So by this standard all pre-pubescent boys and girls are allowed to make out furiously all the time? It also imposes the idea on young women that they need to wear make-up to be appreciated by men.

145,"I would first like to thank my opponent for starting this debate and for his arguments. I will first respond to my opponent's contentions before responding to his rebuttals of my contentions. In my opponent's observations, my opponent states that China does not have the military capability to challenge the United States in the Pacific, so I cannot claim that the US considers China a threat. This is inaccurate as this is assuming that China would be engaging in a direct, militaristic conflict with the United States. This is also inaccurate as just because the US is the sole superpower on the planet does not mean there will be no one to challenge them. Keep in mind, the US was the sole superpower in 2001, and yet we faced the worst terrorist attack in the nation's history, causing us to go to war overseas for nearly ten years. My opponent's first contention states that China's cheap manufacturing increases quality of life. My opponent tags several sources, yet does not link to them, so I will ask my opponent to provide those links for a proper understanding of the points. Yet this does not address the numerous lost US jobs and decrease in wages [1], which definitely lowers the quality of life in the US drastically. While manipulation of the current yuan does result in cheaper goods for US consumers, Chinese currency manipulation is not only illegal [2] but it severely hurts US jobs and results in hundreds of billions of dollars lost [3]. This heavily outweighs the impact my opponent is trying to advance. My opponent's second contention states that China helps American companies. Again, this does not address the tremendous loss of jobs, decrease in wages as well as billions lost due to the trade deficit. My opponent states as well in this contention that China helps US companies by being a source of competition. My opponent does not specify as to how this helps US companies, so until he does provide some backing for this, this point must be ignored. That aside, rising competitiveness between the US and China might actually be dangerous, especially in technology [3]. My opponent's third contention states that China helps in trade, and he states several dollar amounts that trade with China raises with the US. However, this again does not address that China and the US are unbalanced when it comes to trade, resulting in tremendous job losses and numerous other economic faults, which outweigh any gained revenue. I will now proceed to address my opponent's rebuttals. My opponent's rebuttals to my first contention is that ""China is not stealing jobs as their rise will change their economy"", ""Jobs being shipped overseas is our own fault and we shouldn't expect jobs to come to us"", ""China's wages might be increasing, but this doesn't matter as US productivity will remain higher than China's"", ""US manufacturing is rising"" and ""These major companies are moving back to the US"". The first rebuttal does not address my contention, as it is assuming something in the future while we are addressing the current status of China. The second rebuttal does not address my contention either. As I've demonstrated, China's currency manipulation and trade inequity is resulting in the lost jobs, which is entirely the fault of China. The third rebuttal does not address the contention; even if productivity and incentives are factors, that does not resolve the massive loss in jobs and has not been seen being done heavily in practice. Again, my impact outweighs my opponent's points. The fourth rebuttal is unsatisfactory; even if US manufacturing is increasing, that does not resolve the fact that we have lost numerous jobs to China nor does it resolve those losses. The fifth rebuttal is also unsatisfactory; my opponent's two examples are just that, specific examples, and do not rebut the fact that China has cost us jobs nor does it recuperate those lost jobs. My first contention is still standing. My opponent's rebuttal to my second contention is simply ""China wouldn't do such a thing"". This is ignoring the fact that China is currently hurting the dollar right now; my second contention is not a theory or hypothesis, it's based on evidence of China's actions. China's actions point to them threatening the US dollar. My opponent's rebuttal does not apply and my contention remains standing. My opponent's rebuttals to my third contention are ""China wouldn't try to threaten the US"", ""China's military is complacent"", ""China's budget is less than the US"", ""China is reducing gasoline"", ""China has a green vehicle industry"" and ""China's weapons are vulnerable to U.S. cyber attacks"". My opponent's first two contentions are that ""China wouldn't try to threaten the US"", which is incorrect as we are seeing evidence of them threatening the US, contradicting my opponent's rebuttal. ""China's military is complacent"" is incorrect; China's military is dangerously growing [4] [5]. ""China's budget is less than the US"" does not address the contention; as long as the Chinese military threatens the US, this rebuttal falls. ""China is reducing gasoline"" and ""China has a green vehicle industry"" does not address the point made about Iran; as long as China is supporting Iran, which they are currently, these rebuttals fall. These rebuttals do not even address national security, which was the contention at hand. Finally, ""China's weapons are vulnerable to US cyber attacks"" does not address the contention either; as long as China's military technology threatens the US, which they do and which China has used recently, these rebuttals fall. This contention is still standing. For these reasons, I strongly urge a ballot in negation of the resolution. Sources: [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>...

147,"Thank you for providing definitions for the purpose of this debate. It is childish to create an organization to support weak arguments because you agree with them ideologically. In fitting with the Merriam-Webster definition, it certainly indicative of lacking poise. It also shows the immaturity of the individuals involved, unwilling to accept that they lost their debate simply by arguing poorly or choosing a poor argument to make, while being unable to support it. As far as being counter productive is considered, it depends on the goal of the user of Debate.org. Many come here to debate, and as you said rant. The Debates are then subject to what many would hope to be a relatively fair review by fellow users. So, for users who specifically hold this goal it is very counter productive. Individuals that are interested in belonging to a community online will also find voting blocs to be counter productive. The online community will suffer if individuals debating are left with a nasty taste in their mouths as the votes come in because they have been in a debate targeted by one voting bloc or another. This will naturally lead to hostility. While violence is certainly one way to create an unsafe environment, it is not the only way. With the use of the internet, there are many ways that a person can attack another without ever getting up from their key board. This could lead to a number of poor results, causing financial damage and emotional pain. There is also the possibility of terrible personal attacks being made that are completely unfounded. Having groups of debaters forming voting blocs and launching personal attacks at one another hardly sounds like ""fun"" to me. To have these personal attacks then supported by more talented users of technology with cyber attacks doesn't sound safe, although it could possibly add to the fun - but I doubt that's the kind of fun the creator of this website meant. My resolution still stands that voting blocs are childish and counter productive to create voting blocs to support weak arguments. I was not making a statement that all voting blocs are childish and counter productive, fore instance it might be quite beneficial to the community if a voting block was formed to support grammar or polite arguments. However, creating a voting block to support weak arguments because of an agreement with ideology, for an example, is childish and counter productive. The difficulty is, of course, the that inspired this debate dictated that you support the arguments ""If you agree with them."" It doesn't say to support the argument that was the strongest, just the person you agreed with. Voting for what you agree with is different than supporting the strongest argument. It is supporting the weak argument that will make fun and safety less apparent on this website.",1,Patrick_Henry,"
  
Thank you for providing definitions for the purpose of this debate.  
  
It is childish to create an organization to support weak arguments because you agree with them ideologically. In fitting with the Merriam-Webster definition, it certainly indicative of lacking poise. It also shows the immaturity of the individuals involved, unwilling to accept that they lost their debate simply by arguing poorly or choosing a poor argument to make, while being unable to support it.  
  
As far as being counter productive is considered, it depends on the goal of the user of Debate.org. Many come here to debate, and as you said rant. The Debates are then subject to what many would hope to be a relatively fair review by fellow users. So, for users who specifically hold this goal it is very counter productive.  
  
Individuals that are interested in belonging to a community online will also find voting blocs to be counter productive. The online community will suffer if individuals debating are left with a nasty taste in their mouths as the votes come in because they have been in a debate targeted by one voting bloc or another. This will naturally lead to hostility.

They provide an inaccurate look at the reality of what they are about because personal issues are thrown in to capture the audience. Nowadays, people do want to learn, but they want to learn with something that can catch their attention. By adding in drama going on with the characters themselves, people continue to watch, and still are learning about the topic of that show. TLC is probably well aware that shows like Honey Boo do not provide the greatest message, but they have an audience who may not only care for the family's personal problems, but being in pageants. The family of Honey Boo Boo is not particularly rich, and there are probably viewers who want to learn about how to save/bargain if they have children who want to be in beauty pageants. Honey Boo Boo aside, TLC aims to please their viewers. If they have the money from people watching their ""not so great shows"", they can put it towards more educational television. The reality shows they offer are basically there to get viewers, keep them entertained, and get money. With money, comes new ideas for more educational programming. As for future generations, they could still watch and learn something from TLC's programs. It is just up to the parent or guardians to keep those children aware of what is right, what is wrong, and to form their own ideas of what they watch. TLC still should be considered ""The Learning Channel"" because their shows are educational, it is just that the shows are focused on expanding the views and attention spans of their audience.",1,MaddietheOpinionated,"

Immigration Arguments : Gifted and Talented : Within any given background, 99% of the time there is at least one student who wishes to excel within their studies and the amount of work given to them during class is simply not enough. The education within any average school in NSW is not enough for a student to receive their maximum potential in life. Many students believe that they lack enough education just within the school and therefore seek for further learning material outside of school. They spend money on other materials to aid them in their education outside of school. This can either be done because they are falling behind or simply because they wish to study more for a better job. The same thing can be applied to those students outside of NSW who are not receiving the same level of education at their school. If they believe that they are not learning enough within their own school, they themselves re able to do something about it. Some options include going some extensive coaching, studying more online or simply buying the books neccesarry for their learning. We humans are smart enough to know whether we wish to study more or not. Those with LEARNING DISSABILITIES : Pro's resolution clearly was "" that Australian education should be same throughout the nation"". He therefore implies that the education for EVERY STUDENT within Australia must be the same. This is proven as a very unreasonable as there are those who have learning disabilities within specific schools in Australia. These disabilities make creates difficulties for those students to learn, and therefore will not be able to progress at the same rate as required by the education provided by the government. Some of these disabilities that can be taken note of include: 1. Those who are visually impaired 2. Those with ADHD 3. Those who are audibly impaired. Just to name a few. By trying to create the same education system for all the students in Australia, those with learning difficulties can create a big gap between those without. In schools with students who suffer from learning difficulties, they are given a much less demanding workload for obvious reasons. It will illogical to change the education system for ""the good of the nation"" as claimed by pro in his first argument. English as a SECOND LANGUAGE : There are a lot of students in Australia who study English as their second language. The main reason is because their family migrated from a different country and decided to live in Australia. Those from Asian countries are a common example. The point that I am trying to make is that those who are learning English as their second language should not be disadvantaged by being forced to be put into the same education as those who have English as their first tongue. This will not only create major difficulties in their studies of English, but also create difficulties to understand the material being taught during class. This is commonly why most school in Australia (Primary school, Middle school and High School) have an ""ESL"" (English as Second Language) unit for students who are newly migrated to Australia. It provides them a more comfortable setting and allows them to study at a more reasonable/suitable pace for their level of education. The implementation of this ""one education system"" for all students currently in Australia will not be a reasonable option. CONCLUSION : The disadvantages of creating an ""education system that is the same throughout the nation"" clearly outweighs the advantages. One must take into concern that it will affect the studies of those who having learning difficulties and those who have English as their second tongue. Educated readers may also note that uniting the education system in Australia as one will benefit none of those students who are naturally gifted and talented.

These disabilities make creates difficulties for those students to learn, and therefore will not be able to progress at the same rate as required by the education provided by the government. Some of these disabilities that can be taken note of include:  1. Those who are visually impaired   2. Those with ADHD  3. Those who are audibly impaired.   Just to name a few.   By trying to create the same education system for all the students in Australia, those with learning difficulties can create a big gap between those without. In schools with students who suffer from learning difficulties, they are given a much less demanding workload for obvious reasons. It will illogical to change the education system for ""the good of the nation"" as claimed by pro in his first argument.   English as a SECOND LANGUAGE  :  There are a lot of students in Australia who study English as their second language. The main reason is because their family migrated from a different country and decided to live in Australia. Those from Asian countries are a common example.   The point that I am trying to make is that those who are learning English as their second language should not be disadvantaged by being forced to be put into the same education as those who have English as their first tongue. This will not only create major difficulties in their studies of English, but also create difficulties to understand the material being taught during class.   This is commonly why most school in Australia (Primary school, Middle school and High School) have an ""ESL"" (English as Second Language) unit for students who are newly migrated to Australia. It provides them a more comfortable setting and allows them to study at a more reasonable/suitable pace for their level of education.   The implementation of this ""one education system"" for all students currently in Australia will not be a reasonable option.   CONCLUSION  :  The disadvantages of creating an ""education system that is the same throughout the nation"" clearly outweighs the advantages. One must take into concern that it will affect the studies of those who having learning difficulties and those who have English as their second tongue. Educated readers may also note that uniting the education system in Australia as one will benefit none of those students who are naturally gifted and talented.   It is now up to Pro to prove to use why implementing this ""one education"" system for the entire nation will actually be beneficial.   Onto pro to make his second argument...",Education,0,The-Australian-education-system-should-united-and-be-the-same-level-as-the-Nsw-education-system/1/,57420

166,"I want to thank Pro for his final round and will now begin with my closing rebuttals. Arguments/Rebuttals I. ""Is run by"" = ""Is owned by"" In this line of argumentation I expanded on who really owns MTV, a multi-national media company called Viacom. The man who runs the MTV portion of Viacom is Tom Freston, as shown in my previous round. I stated in the last round that for Pro's premise to be considered valid he would need to present proof of Tom Freston being a Freemason. In response, Pro said the following: ""They would be secret Freemasons. I obviously can't give proof for that, but It's an assumption based off of the other points I made."" This is the problem... Pro said, ""it's an assumption"". Unfortunately, that is not enough to affirm Pro's position. Pro needs to uphold the BOP (Burden of Proof), which is the obligation to prove one's assertion. Without such proof, there is no reason to accept Pro's assumptions as valid. In short, assumptions are unfortunately not enough to uphold the burden of proof that is needed to affirm Pro's position. Additionally, pictures of a Masonic temple or celebrities on MTV add nothing to the claim that MTV is owned by Freemasons. What Pro needed to do to uphold his burden was provide sound proof to validate his assumptions. That could have come in the form of Tom Freston wearing a Masonic ring in a picture, perhaps a Masonic logo on his vehicle, or a picture of him attending a Masonic lodge. Unfortunately for Pro, no such evidence was given, thus there is absolutely no reason to *assume* that he is a Freemason. I could claim that Brittney spears is a Freemason too, but without proof there is no reason to accept such a claim as a valid one. Hence this line of argumentation remains standing while Pro's assumptions stand defeated due to a lack of valid proof. II. ""One of the MTV headquarters is in/by a Masonic Temple."" Pro offered no rebuttal for this line of argumentation. Thus I extend it as it remains standing unchallenged by Pro. Pro's initial claim was that one of MTV's offices are located in a building that once served as a Masonic temple, thus MTV is run by Freemasons. However, if you look at the Wikipedia page for that specific building, it shows a CTV sign. [1] The article goes on to say that before the building was purchased by CTV, ""it housed live music clubs known as the Concert Hall."" In addition to the previous owners not being Freemasons, MTV itself decided to move its office to another location in the city and sold the building to an IT-firm on June 17, 2013. So... the building isn't even occupied by MTV anymore. [2] [3] With it shown that the building itself has been under numerous owners, there is no reason to assume that just because MTV happened to be one of many occupants during it's history that MTV is run by Freemasons. Lastly, during the sale of the building from MTV to an IT-firm, the local Freemasons attempted to reclaim the building for themselves. [4] This raises the question as to why they'd want to reclaim the building for themselves if they technically own/run it themselves. It just doesn't make sense. The evidence is clear, the fact that MTV *temporarily* occupied the building holds no weight for the claim that Pro tried making by saying that ""because they are located in a Masonic temple = they are run by Freemasons"". This line of argumentation from Pro stands defeated. III. ""Part of MTV's Video Music Awards on the left side of the picture, and a Masonic ritual on the right"" Ah, I just noticed the 2nd picture Pro shared which shows the Masonic symbol with the words ""concert hall"" right above it on the brick interior wall. This makes perfect sense though since the Masonic temple became the ""concert hall"" after the masons moved out. The mimicry of the celebrities in the MTV awards picture in regards to the Masonic ritual of being tied with a noose while blindfolded and tied hands does nothing to affirm that MTV is run by Freemasons. That ritual is highly sacred, and if MTV WAS owned by Freemasons, they'd never allow non-masons to mimic such rituals publicly, especially if the celebrity is uninitiated. Furthermore, the celebrity in the image wasn't even mimicking the ritual in full. There was no noose, nor was the celebrity wearing the white-clothes which is a key part of the ritual. To the untrained eye, it really does look very similar. To the trained eye though, it's clear that it is far from the actual ritual, as well as the fact that a Mason would never allow a celebrity to mimic such a sacred ritual publicly. If anything, it is merely the script-writers and production teams for the show leeching off the latest fad of illuminati nonsense. It's easy to appear as if you are involved in Masonry, especially to the dumbed-down public which knows nothing of Masonic rituals unless they themselves have visited a temple and partook in the rituals themselves. Thus, these images do nothing in terms of providing substantial evidence in Pro's attempt of affirming the resolution. All they reflect are modern television shows (which is what the awards are) hopping on the illuminati bandwagon to increase viewer retention and rates due to the intriguing nature that surrounds such things as 'secret societies'. In closing, Pro dropped a major argument. Pro also failed to provide any substantial evidence and reasoning to show that MTV is run by Freemasons. On the flip side, I've provided rebuttals to each line of argumentation while utilizing valid evidence and sources. With Pro's lack of substantial evidence and arguments which were based solely on assumptions, I believe the resolution stands negated. I want to thank Pro for this invigorating debate, and look forward to any and all challenges in the future! Sources [1] <URL>... (Toronto) [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>...

[1] The article goes on to say that before the building was purchased by CTV, ""it housed live music clubs known as the Concert Hall.""   In addition to the previous owners not being Freemasons, MTV itself decided to move its office to another location in the city and sold the building to an IT-firm on June 17, 2013. So... the building isn't even occupied by MTV anymore. [2] [3]   With it shown that the building itself has been under numerous owners, there is no reason to assume that just because MTV happened to be one of many occupants during it's history that MTV is run by Freemasons.   Lastly, during the sale of the building from MTV to an IT-firm, the local Freemasons attempted to reclaim the building for themselves. [4] This raises the question as to why they'd want to reclaim the building for themselves if they technically own/run it themselves. It just doesn't make sense.   The evidence is clear, the fact that MTV *temporarily* occupied the building holds no weight for the claim that Pro tried making by saying that ""because they are located in a Masonic temple = they are run by Freemasons"". This line of argumentation from Pro stands defeated.   III. ""Part of MTV's Video Music Awards on the left side of the picture, and a Masonic ritual on the right""  Ah, I just noticed the 2nd picture Pro shared which shows the Masonic symbol with the words ""concert hall"" right above it on the brick interior wall. This makes perfect sense though since the Masonic temple became the ""concert hall"" after the masons moved out.   The mimicry of the celebrities in the MTV awards picture in regards to the Masonic ritual of being tied with a noose while blindfolded and tied hands does nothing to affirm that MTV is run by Freemasons. That ritual is highly sacred, and if MTV WAS owned by Freemasons, they'd never allow non-masons to mimic such rituals publicly, especially if the celebrity is uninitiated. Furthermore, the celebrity in the image wasn't even mimicking the ritual in full. There was no noose, nor was the celebrity wearing the white-clothes which is a key part of the ritual.   To the untrained eye, it really does look very similar.   To the trained eye though, it's clear that it is far from the actual ritual, as well as the fact that a Mason would never allow a celebrity to mimic such a sacred ritual publicly.  If anything, it is merely the script-writers and production teams for the show leeching off the latest fad of illuminati nonsense. It's easy to appear as if you are involved in Masonry, especially to the dumbed-down public which knows nothing of Masonic rituals unless they themselves have visited a temple and partook in the rituals themselves.   Thus, these images do nothing in terms of providing substantial evidence in Pro's attempt of affirming the resolution. All they reflect are modern television shows (which is what the awards are) hopping on the illuminati bandwagon to increase viewer retention and rates due to the intriguing nature that surrounds such things as 'secret societies'.   In closing,   Pro dropped a major argument. Pro also failed to provide any substantial evidence and reasoning to show that MTV is run by Freemasons. On the flip side, I've provided rebuttals to each line of argumentation while utilizing valid evidence and sources. With Pro's lack of substantial evidence and arguments which were based solely on assumptions, I believe the resolution stands negated.   I want to thank Pro for this invigorating debate, and look forward to any and all challenges in the future!   Sources  [1]   http://en.wikipedia.org...  (Toronto)  [2]   http://www.blogto.com...

173,"As there are no questions regarding definitions, I shall assume they are all accepted. Firstly, I wish to mention there are no known non-biblical references to a historical Jesus by any writer of the time during and after Jesus's purported existence. In the words of Barbara Walker: ""No literate person of his own time mentioned him in any known writing."" Jewish philosopher Judaeus of Alexandria, alive at the proposed time of Jesus, the wealthiest and best connected citizens of the Empire, says nothing of Christ in his voluminous writings. Nor do any of the many historians and writers who flourished during the first one to two centuries of the era, and even then, nothing comes up until the time of Iraenius. Secondly, in the words of Justin Martyr: And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was produced without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. This shows again something that one needs to look at. The Biblical idea of Jesus Christ comes up in most people mind at the date 0 AD (the inexistence of the date is irrelevant). However, the canon source of the Bible is what is of importance. The Bible, written in 325 AD by the First Council of Nicaea[1]. The Greeks The first place to start will be the greeks. They are an old group (older than Christianity at least) and hold many stories which closely link to that of Christianity. Also, due to the geographic proximity, it is highly likely that these two groups had a lot of contact with each other. In fact, it is almost certain: both places being part of the Roman Empire before the first council of Nicaea, after all, made their link almost definite. Homer's work has also been found in the area, as well as references to Aeschylus, so the correlation is very likely to have existed. The character I wish to recognise first is Prometheus. Prometheus is is a Titan, a champion of mankind, known for his wily intelligence, who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to mortals. (or mankind had fire, Zeus took it away, then Prometheus gave it back). Zeus then crucified him, but forgave the sins of man. Firstly, Prometheus descended from heaven as a deitious being in order to give mankind fire and was punished for doing so by Zeus. Jesus descended from heaven as a deitious being in order to give mankind New Rules and was punished for doing so by the community. The community then crucified him, but forgave the sins of man. The main clashes here are obvious: Jesus/Prometheus' descendence from heaven, descended as a deitious being, the fire/new rules and the giver of the punishment. The first requires my opponent to prove that there is a difference[2]. This is also true of the second[2]. The third and the fourth require more allegorical interpretation - that is not to say more forced interpretetation, but simply not taking the phrase ""fire"" as meaning a literal burning stick of wood. Fire was allegorical, as were many things in the play, but the fire was one that was an ""obvious and transparent symbol""[3]. The fire, according to sparknotes, represents the gift of artistic and technological advancement, however the limiting scope to these two things is undesirable: Vellacott and many other literary scholars[4] put forth that it is complete growth in all aspects, a spiritual and philosophical growth as well as all others, and that limitting it to just science is ungrounded. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the fire was a growth done to increase humanity and human understanding. Now, the comparison to Jesus in this way is very clear. Jesus being the light to illuminate us all[5] is clear, and Jesus being known as the truth is obvious as well[6]. Regarding the crucifixion, the chaining to the 'stone' is well known as being similar: Dr. Martin Hengel remarks: When describing how his hero is fastened to two rocks in the Caucasus, Lucian uses all the technical terms of a crucifixion: Prometheus is to be nailed to two rocks above a ravine in the sight of all, in such a way as to produce the effect of ""a most serviceable cross"" Simone Weil uses the word ""crucifies"" to describe specifically the event that happened with both Prometheus and Jesus.[7] There are many people who see this correlation, and it is not one that is rare. There is a massive correlation between these two ideas. I shall present other correlations in my future post, and await a rebuttal.

174,"My opponent misunderstands; by pointing out the gap in time between Yoda's prime and Luke's, I am not saying the fight could not take place. This is a hypothetical duel, after all. All I was trying to say was, the Yoda you see in the movies was old and dying, and - compared to when he was in his prime - slow and weak. He still beat the tar out of Palpatine. ""I also want to point out the fact that Yoda uses Ataru not Soresu."" A typo. The validity of the argument is unaffected; and I did say it was form IV, which was correct.

His preferred form has advantages which cancel out Luke's greater reach and aggression. My opponent has failed to answer almost all of the arguments from last round, including: - My comparison of Luke and Yoda using Palpatine as a benchmark, - My defence of the experience point (Yoda has been far more duels than Luke, and against greater opponents; this gives him an edge in our duel), - My defence of the knowledge point (since Luke never mastered ALL of the lightsaber forms, Yoda will be able to pull tricks out of his sleeve that Luke won't expect.) - The fact that Yoda knows and can use many more Force techniques than Luke.

Yoda is called by the wiki ""one of the most skilled users of the Force in the history of the galaxy."" He lived for 900 years during the golden age of the Jedi, and had time to learn every Force technique. He was Windu's first teacher, and was present for his training and career; he is not a strange to Shatterpoint, as he was the mentor of the most famous Shatterpoint-user. There are relatively few stories about Yoda, as Lucas wanted to keep him something of a mystery. There are many stories about Luke, of course; but most of them have to do with him learning Force techniques that were lost in the Purge - techniques that Yoda taught in the Jedi Temple. There is no way for me to exhaustively list all of the Force techniques Yoda knew. No doubt, most of them aren't even recorded. Luke's force lightning will be used against him by Yoda, who can re-direct it back at him. If he calls up a force storm, there's no reason why Yoda cannot do the same, or redirect it back at him. A few examples of Yoda's Force abilities: - he mastered Force Valour, which renders the user almost invisible; - he turned off Ventress's lightsabers while they were still in her hands, and took them away using the Force; - precognition, an ability he was noted for before the Sith clouded the Force. When he is listed as one of the most skilled masters of the Force to have ever lived, I expect that statement to speak for itself. If there is a way to use the power of the Force, it is a safe guess that Yoda can use it. I now return the debate to my opponent, and ask him to address my arguments.

My opponent misunderstands; by pointing out the gap in time between Yoda's prime and Luke's, I am not saying the fight could not take place. This is a hypothetical duel, after all. All I was trying to say was, the Yoda you see in the movies was old and dying, and - compared to when he was in his prime - slow and weak. He still beat the tar out of Palpatine.  
  
""I also want to point out the fact that Yoda uses Ataru not Soresu.""  
A typo. The validity of the argument is unaffected; and I did say it was form IV, which was correct. The point was Yoda's greater mastery of the lightsaber, since he had mastered ALL of the forms (including soresu, incidentally) and was capable of using any of them. His preferred form has advantages which cancel out Luke's greater reach and aggression.

In operation north woods parts of the government tried to get Kennedy to help stage a cuban attack on Florida so America could blame the communists and invade Cuba. Our government had done this stuff before so I find it very annoying when people like the amazing atheist think it's crazy to believe that our government will do it again. 1. Wolfgang Halbig is a national school safety consultant. He spent many years as a Florida state trooper and almost 25 years as a national school safety consultant. He was present at the columbine shooting. He has been to every state and helped train people how to keep schools safe. When sandy hook first Happened he donated money. He offered to help analyze the event. He than began to realize that there were many strange things about the official story. He began asking questions. The questions were not offensive. He wanted to know who declared the victims legally dead, who installed the security cameras, who ordered the porta poddys to the seen, who didn't let the EMTs in to the school ect. After about 10 months two plain clothes cops came to his house and told him bad stuff would happen if he didn't stop asking questions. Why would they try so hard to get him to stop asking basic questions? Why would they not answer the questions? They were not offensive and they were very easy. Than 2 months later he was visited by fbi officials who told him he was being charged with harassment. He didn't harass anyone. He asked basic questions. They asked him if he owned a gun and threatened him again. The lutenant of Newtown tried to shut him up to. He was being threatened for practicing his first amendment right. Here we have a situation where 20 children are injured and may be clinging to life. When the situation was nutralized they still didn't let EMTs in to the building. They didn't request trauma helicopters. The lutenant came to the seen two hours after it began. A kindergarten boy was told to wait in the room where the dead body's were until the seat guys got back. Meanwhile someone ordered porta podys to be sent in. Your worries about the porta posies but not the trauma helicopters? The cops parked 1/4 a mike away. The victims were declared dead in 11 minutes. Who declared them dead? Connecticut law says only a doctor can do that. On dr oz there was a little boy who said they were having a drill while explaining his view of what happened to dr oz. I would like to mention how Robbie Parker tells us exactly my how to donate money to him. After his child was killed he's thinking about money?. 27 million dollars were collected in donations for Newtown. Most of the victims families got free houses on December 25 2009 (Connecticut online data base) the cops were given a big check by Eric holder, each family got 281,000 from the state. Chris menfrodenia claimed he was on his way to make gingerbread houses with his daughters class room...I camo pants and a black jacket? Kathy gaubert is a women from Georgia. A picture of her daughter lily gaubert was taken off her Instagram and used was Allison Wyatt. It was even used on professional official sandy hook sites. Kathy finally pointed out that her daughter lives in Georgia and does not attend sandy hook. We've never seen or heard from Allison's parents. In the video of the Parker family that amazing atheist has Samantha and Madeline don't have legs. Why did they photoshop this picture. Adam Lanza was autistic. People with autism have poor motor skills. He was also 110 pounds soaking wet. He couldn't have physically carried 40 pounds of military equipment in the school and shot 26 people in 5-7 minutes with out any help. He had limited training as well.

I must only determine that at least ONE of the above phrases are not a pun to disprove him. For this, I will choose the phrase: ""...you can't have your kayak and heat it too."" Now I realize the intended pun in this situation. It is arguing that this phrase sounds like, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" However, according to my opponents preferred definition of a pun, it is clearly not. As clearly defined by my opponent, a pun is play on words either by interchanging different senses/definition/interpretations of a same word, or else a similar sense/definition/interpretation and sound of a different word. The words 'kayak' and 'cake' do not share either of these similarities. Kayak is pronounced kaiak (according to <URL>... ) and does not have any different sense other than: an Eskimo canoe made of a frame covered with skins except for a small opening in the center and propelled by a double-bladed paddle (according to <URL>... ). Therefore, it does not meet the first said qualifier of a pun. The arguable qualifier for this word, kayak, as a pun, would be that it shares the the similar sense/definition of the word 'cake' by linking it via a similar sound. However, the only similarity here between the two sounds is the beginning sounds of 'kuh' and the ending sounds of 'kuh'. This is HARDLY enough evidence to prove that ""...you can't have your kayak and heat it too"" is a pun. Please bear with me as I give an example: Two men sit on a bench. They both watch by-passers walk by until one passing man falls to the ground and dies. They both look at the man on the ground until one says, ""Thats the third time today."" ""Yep,"" the other agrees. ""They're just dropping like floss."" Now if you think a long time about this scenario, you realize that its not funny. The joke is obviously intended to compare ""dropping like flies"" to ""dropping like floss"", but the word floss isn't at ALL related to the story at all. This is the same as my opponent's phrase. Both share the similar beginning sounds (kuh and kuh in kayak as to the kuh and kuh in cake AS does the fuh and seh in flies compare to the fuh and seh in floss) but neither are funny or related and neither can be considered puns. Now say that, perhaps, my story was revised to that the men falling down dead were dentists. Then MAYBE it could be considered a pun because of the facetious relationship between the vaguely similar words and the subject. HOWEVER, my opponent's ""pun"" has no such link between his random words and the story. IF the words kayak and cake shared a similar middle sound as well as the beginning and ending similarities, then the pun argument might have some bearing. However, they do not. To strengthen my argument, I will state that there is only one pronunciation of kayak as cited in these numerous sites: <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Unless my opponent has found the pun somewhere else in the phrase debated, of which I am glad to listen to, my conjecture is inarguably correct. To summarize my points: 1. I need only to disprove one of my opponent's ""puns"" to disprove his contention 2. Kayak and cake haven't enough sound similarity to be considered a pun 3. There is no loop hole around the pronunciation of ""kayak"" 4.

189,"I wholesomely thank the pro side for presenting their arguments in a clear and concise manner. I shall be rebutting them one by one, and of course, I'll be putting my sources at the end of the post. Ladies and gentlemen, let us proceed: Pro argues by saying that the death penalty offers social benifits; the first one being peace of mind. I agree that the possibility of a prisoner escaping exists, but statistics show that the odds of that happening are extremely low (1). ' 6,530 people escaped or were AWOL from state prisons. That was a littlemore than one-half of 1 percent of the total population of 1,100,224 state prisoners.' It doesn't end there. Most of these ""breakouts"" are usually recovered. In average, 10000 escapees result in 9000 of these recovered within the same year (1). And that was statistical data from 1998 . As for the present? It should be known that prison escapes are declining due to technology breakthrough (2): As it is seen from this chart, there's in average FOUR escapes per TEN THOUSAND PRISONER (2013 data). That's a number so low, that the chances of being attacked by a prisoner that has escaped from detention are nigh ZERO (You may find the full chart with detailed numbers in the source ndeg2). Now the question to ask is whether it is worth it to apply the death sentence when the rist of prison breakthroughs is so low. I will give my based opinion WHILE rebutting the rest of his aruguments. The second argument provided is a classic. Ah, the theory of ""example"". Pro states that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for potentional criminals, and as an example to murderers. I completely and categorically disagree with that notion, and I will state why: Far, far from scaring away criminals and deterring murderers, the death penalty desensitizes the masses to death, and I have many anecdotal evidences, as well as scientifical and statistical evidence to prove that (more on that later). Not only that, but the ""example theory"" makes no sense whatsoever seeing how the death penalty is currently organized. If you really want the death penalty to be ""deterring"", it has to be seen by the masses. Bring back the medieval age, Farinacci, tormentors, dismembrements, public torching, yada yada; it is a requirement to make the theory work. But in the US and other countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty... you miserably behead or hang a poor man in a deserted boulevard with no one passing, no witnesses (aside from the family of the victim). As for the evidence, let us look at a countries that practiced the death penalty, and how that practice has inevitably contributed to desensitize the masses: France. Not only did the death penalty not reduce the crime rates compared to its neighbour countries that did abolish it, but it resulted in extremely barbaric scenes due to to the desensitization of the masses. Victor Hugo, a french poet and the lead of the romantic scene, gave us a lot of temoinages of his time, alongside some other authors as well. 1832, 5 mars, during the execution of Louis Camus, the public who assisted (because capital punishment was public at the time) swayed towards the guilottine and started dancing around the headless body, and some were said to be ""playing football"" with the head. And that's only one temoinage, as he has left countless more as well. Bottom line, everytime there was a public capital execution, the people of France feisted, sold places to assist as if it was the country circus, dansed around the guillotine, et cetera (3). ALSO; The scientific conclusion is clear. The death penalty does not deter homicide . No study has ever found a deterrent effect, no matter how skewed the research question was in favor the death penalty. Pro has failed to abide by the burden of proof because on study has found any connection whatsoever between decreasing criminality rates and the death penalty. I challenge Pro to prove me otherwise. Actually, studies suggest the exact contrary! The brutalization effect suggests that when violence is condoned via the death penalty, more violence occurs. Homicide rates tend to increase around the time of executions, due to legitimation, desensitization, and imitation. The death penalty makes society more dangerous by further increasing violence through the brutalization effect (4). As for the cost arguments, I must say that Pro is flat out wrong. The death penalty is quite expensive and life imprisonment can be cheaper (5). Over the lifetime of a case, executing prisoners can be three times as expensive as life in prison, primarily due to the higher costs of capital punishment trials, automatic appeals, and the heightened security on death row with lower staff-to-prisoner ratios. Commuting all death sentences to life in prison would save hundreds of millions of dollars per year in the U.S. and many billions over the coming decades. sources are here: <URL>...",1,Lilieze,"

Pro has failed to abide by the burden of proof because on study has found any connection whatsoever between decreasing criminality rates and the death penalty.   I challenge Pro to prove me otherwise.  Actually, studies suggest the exact contrary!   The brutalization effect suggests that when violence is condoned via the death penalty, more violence occurs. Homicide rates tend to increase around the time of executions, due to legitimation, desensitization, and imitation. The death penalty makes society more dangerous by further increasing violence through the brutalization effect (4).  As for the cost arguments, I must say that Pro is flat out wrong.   The death penalty is quite expensive and life imprisonment can be cheaper (5). Over the lifetime of a case, executing prisoners can be three times as expensive as life in prison, primarily due to the higher costs of capital punishment trials, automatic appeals, and the heightened security on death row with lower staff-to-prisoner ratios. Commuting all death sentences to life in prison would save hundreds of millions of dollars per year in the U.S. and many billions over the coming decades.  sources are here:   https://pastebin.com...",Society,1,Some-crimes-should-be-punishable-by-death-as-long-as-a-much-higher-standard-of-proof-is-upheld./1/,54927

If 9 or less cases are pointed out by PRO and stand, CON wins. I have won contentions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. That is 6/10 legitimate arguments. Since 4 cases were demonstrated by Pro to be in his favor, and 4 is less than 9, Pro has lost by the terms of the debate, and has lost even if this generous burden of proof was not present.

This is a debate, you can't have a proxy fill in for you.   2)   Also,   new arguments brought up in the last round do not count  . Therefore, I will not address the sliming arguments you have brought up which include the 24 other points you have brought up and not described how they were lies, nor would the random sound bytes legitimately impune Romney.  3)   Also, you can't post a link to a website you did not write and try to pass that off as your own argument.   A link is not an argument.  Conclusion  According to the setup of the debate, I have won by a clear margin. At the beginning of the debate, this was the setup:   CON: Has to rebut PRO. If 9 or less cases are pointed out by PRO and stand, CON wins.   I have won contentions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. That is 6/10 legitimate arguments. Since 4 cases were demonstrated by Pro to be in his favor, and 4 is less than 9, Pro has lost by the terms of the debate, and has lost even if this generous burden of proof was not present.   I have won this debate conclusively on the agreed grounds.

Therefore in the second round you state the issue of cyber-bullying and suicidal attempts which is a way to release hatred. Now we all know that kids cannot bare insults at a small age. Yes, we are aware of that. Now first thing is ""Why cyber-bullying occurs?"" The main reason being ""Jealousy towards someone else"" and this is where small kids tend to suppress and dominate others just to be better than them because they know that they are NOT. Now what are the solutions to ""Cyber-bullying?"" In one way, the kid who is bullying others must be constantly warned and monitored by his elders. If he does not come to terms than action must be taken ethically and make him realize his mistakes. THIS IS HOW THEIR MINDS WILL DEVELOP IN THE FIRST PLACE if we talk about maturity. However, Social media cannot stop people posting their opinions but they still have a way. AND THEY STILL TAKE A STAND AGAINST CYBER BULLYING AND THEY ARE NOT SITING QUITE ABOUT THIS! They have made a ""blocking option."" They have made a ""report this user"" option. They have a ""mute option"" They have a ""ban option"" What else do you expect Social Media to do? People will be like ""He is bullying me SO I will suicide and give up my life. I HATE FACEBOOK"" Well newsflash for you ""FACEBOOK HAS THESE ABOVE OPTIONS. WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THEM HUH?"" Stop blaming social media. So, please don't say that cyber-bullying is because social media exists. Cyber-bullying exists BECAUSE BAD PEOPLE EXIST. If not cyber-bullying, we have Rapes, harassment, robbery, murder, stealing lunch etc etc. What about that?^^ No matter where you go you will find BULLYING in one way or the other. THIS IS BECAUSE OF BAD PEOPLE FOLKS! Tomorrow, if some murders with a KNIFE. WHO WILL YOU BLAME? The Knife? Or The one who USED THE KNIFE? So you see, knife is a tool to serve your purpose, but the way you USE knife is totally up to you. And let me make this clear, THERE IS NO STOP TO BULLYING IN ANY MANNER. Bullying does stop at cyber-bullying. If you look at the Obama's speech against Trump, the way he made a mockery out of him (DO NOT VOTE TRUMP!!!) this means I will BLAME the MIC and not OBAMA because MIC is a tool. Or if you see trump's speech where he throws out Muslims. THIS IS ALSO BULLYING where I will blame the mic and not TRUMP!! That's just RIDICULOUS. So why differentiate with Social Media? Even Social media is a tool, like mic or knife. Moreover, if a kid is facing cyber bullying, it is clearly understood by his behavior and facial expressions that ""Something is not right."" and they are vulnerable to THREATS. Which is what parents must understand and THIS is where they must interfere. But being stupid they DON'T and let their kid go through that and then regret. This is again the PARENTS to blame. Even the kids who are not mature, need help. We understand. This is why PARENTS have to take the step. DO NOT BLAME SOCIAL MEDIA for someone else's mistake. I repeat. The girl who killed herself is utterly stupid. She was looking for attention and when she found herself being humiliated for what she did, she starts to blame FACEBOOK. However, Social Media is now keeping a check of all accounts whether you know it or not to act against cyber-bullying and hacking. If they find any suspicious activity, they WILL take action against it. My point being that The AGE must be lowered to 10 so that every one has equal access and rights but they have to be monitored. All these technologies that we humans created, are all tools. Now that everything that depends on is HOW we use it. Humans just don't want to blame themselves so they look forward to blaming tools regardless of their ages. Social Media is a BOON in this era which everyone should utilize it. Please do not snatch this BOON from small children. Let them experience this BOON but at the same time take care of them. Let me tell you this, We have worked hard enough to achieve what we have today. So respect what we made. Respect our INVENTIONS. Don't blame our technology or tools. Blame the ONES who MISUSE THEM.",1,brainFreeze,"

AND THEY STILL TAKE A STAND AGAINST CYBER BULLYING AND THEY ARE NOT SITING QUITE ABOUT THIS!  
They have made a ""blocking option.""  
They have made a ""report this user"" option.  
They have a ""mute option""  
They have a ""ban option""  
What else do you expect Social Media to do? People will be like ""He is bullying me SO I will suicide and give up my life. I HATE FACEBOOK"" Well newsflash for you ""FACEBOOK HAS THESE ABOVE OPTIONS. WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THEM HUH?""  
Stop blaming social media.  
  
So, please don't say that cyber-bullying is because social media exists. Cyber-bullying exists BECAUSE BAD PEOPLE EXIST.  
If not cyber-bullying, we have Rapes, harassment, robbery, murder, stealing lunch etc etc.  
What about that?^^  
No matter where you go you will find BULLYING in one way or the other. THIS IS BECAUSE OF BAD PEOPLE FOLKS!  
Tomorrow, if some murders with a KNIFE. WHO WILL YOU BLAME?  
The Knife?  
Or The one who USED THE KNIFE?  
  
So you see, knife is a tool to serve your purpose, but the way you USE knife is totally up to you.  
And let me make this clear, THERE IS NO STOP TO BULLYING IN ANY MANNER. Bullying does stop at cyber-bullying.  
  
If you look at the Obama's speech against Trump, the way he made a mockery out of him (DO NOT VOTE TRUMP!!!) this means I will BLAME the MIC and not OBAMA because MIC is a tool.  
Or if you see trump's speech where he throws out Muslims. THIS IS ALSO BULLYING where I will blame the mic and not TRUMP!! That's just RIDICULOUS.  
  
So why differentiate with Social Media? Even Social media is a tool, like mic or knife.  
  
Moreover, if a kid is facing cyber bullying, it is clearly understood by his behavior and facial expressions that ""Something is not right."" and they are vulnerable to THREATS. Which is what parents must understand and THIS is where they must interfere. But being stupid they DON'T and let their kid go through that and then regret. This is again the PARENTS to blame.  
Even the kids who are not mature, need help. We understand. This is why PARENTS have to take the step. DO NOT BLAME SOCIAL MEDIA for someone else's mistake. I repeat.  
  
The girl who killed herself is utterly stupid. She was looking for attention and when she found herself being humiliated for what she did, she starts to blame FACEBOOK.  
  
However, Social Media is now keeping a check of all accounts whether you know it or not to act against cyber-bullying and hacking. If they find any suspicious activity, they WILL take action against it.  
My point being that  
  
The AGE must be lowered to 10 so that every one has equal access and rights but they have to be monitored.  
All these technologies that we humans created, are all tools. Now that everything that depends on is HOW we use it. Humans just don't want to blame themselves so they look forward to blaming tools regardless of their ages.  
  
Social Media is a BOON in this era which everyone should utilize it. Please do not snatch this BOON from small children. Let them experience this BOON but at the same time take care of them.  
  
Let me tell you this,  
We have worked hard enough to achieve what we have today. So respect what we made. Respect our INVENTIONS.  
Don't blame our technology or tools. Blame the ONES who MISUSE THEM.",Education,1,Should-the-social-media-age-be-lowered-to-10/1/,53519

215,"I believe that students should not be able to talk in class during all of my distinguished opponent's given circumstances except for circumstance 4. If a student sincerely needs to use the bathroom, then they should be able to speak out. In all circumstances, it is disrespectful and frowned upon, but the bathroom situation is an exception. School, no matter what aspect of it, is preparing you for the real world. Whether it is working, behaving in a proper manner and instilling common etiquette skills. I will support my arguments using real-world examples. Now, as for students talking during class, talking while a teacher is talking is considered disrespectful. If you talked while your boss was talking to you, or if you were talking during a meeting when someone else was talking, you will more than likely be given a stern warning, and if you keep up showing disrespect to your coworkers and/or bosses, you will be on the fast track to being fired, losing a raise, being demoted or not being promoted. You will have a bad reputation, not only with your coworkers , but also within the workplace. Many kids claim that they talk during class because they do not want to learn. Oh well, life is tough and unfair, and you will not make it anywhere in the world once you leave high school because you will have to do things that you will not want to or that are very unappealing. Kids do not understand that schools are providing you what you will need in the real world so that you can have a successful life. If you don't want to learn those valuable things, then you are simply making it harder on yourself. Many more kids say that they talk in class and do not pay attention because they think the class is boring. Whether or not you find a class boring is not anybody's problem except for yours. If you do not like a class and/or find it boring, suck it up and take it. There are going to be times like that all throughout your life, whether in high school, in college, at work, or even at home. Just face it. Life will always have boring situations and you may not want to do something, and if you do not do what you are told, the only harm done will be done to you, by you. One last point: students say that talk and do not pay attention because they do not like the teacher. The students say that they want to choose their teachers. Well, if students were permitted to chose their teachers and their classes (which you can sort-of-kind-of do in high school; they give you a little more leeway and are not as strict. Then again, by the time you reach high school, you usually have the sense to be respectful and not talk during class and to pay attention and do your work), they would not be accurately prepared for adult life. In the real world, you cannot choose your boss or the people you work with. If you do not learn what schools are preparing you with, you may have a small choice in the job you want (like what fast-food joint you want to work at), but, regardless of your choice of job, you will more than likely find it boring, and you may look back and wish that you did better in school, and maybe you should not have been talking during class and maybe you should have paid more attention. Ultimately, school is preparing students for life, for the real world. If students do not value what they are being taught so much as to be disrespectful, then the students must not care about their future.

216,"My initial complaint was with Pro arbitrarily defining the term 'young people' to mean 10 and under and then arguing that only their opinions matter. He seems to have dropped these points. His new trick is to suggest that my contentions only apply to certain age groups, which is ridiculous. My arguments - Batman is a criminal, emotionally unstable, and abusive to children - are all straightforward and universally understood. My Case Gotham's Biggest Criminal Pro's argument is a non-starter; he cannot both praise Batman for stopping crime and then condone Batman's crimes. By claiming Batman's actions as just a means to an end, Pro renders law, and thus Batman's entire mission, meaningless. Even Batman doesn't pretend what he's doing is right or legal. He runs from the police and only works with Commissioner Gordon in secret. He was relieved when Harvey Dent, an ""honest"" crime fighter, came to town. He doesn't work with the public or even make himself or his goals known. He clearly knows what he's doing is wrong and self-defeating, he just can't help himself. Pro tries to go line by line and explain why Batman's crimes are exceptions to the rule (though he conveniently leaves out the more serious charges), but he misses the whole point. There is a reason we don't see police officers breaking into homes without warrants, hanging criminals off balconies, or driving their cars through buildings. Vigilantism puts the public in danger, disregards the rights of the accused, undermines our justice system, and destroys civilized society. No results Batman could ever attain would erase the damage of his renegade antics and the fact that his irresponsibility is the antithesis of everything he claims to defend. Why So Sociopathic? Pro concedes the crux of my argument: Batman is insane. He goes on to say that he is still admirable because he continues to ""move on in the only way he knows how."" But...he's not moving on, is he? In fact, he is as emotionally and psychologically stunted as a person could ever be. He modeled his entire adult life around a single childhood trauma and it has ended him as a person. He isn't Bruce Wayne anymore. He's a husk of vengeance and loneliness, hiding his face and sitting alone in the dark. What message does this send to readers? That when faced with pain, repay the world in kind? That when adversity strikes, dwell on it, make it the center of your world, and forsake all others in the process? That is about as unhealthy and unhero-like as it gets. Generally, heroes use personal loss as a source of inspiration, not obsession. That's why, in the pantheon of superheroes, only Batman has no friends, no love, no life of any kind. He only has the mask. Batman's story isn't admirable, it's pitiable. Worst. Babysitter. Ever. Let me get this straight...Batman trains children to fight murderers, physically takes the children to the murderers, watches as they are murdered, and he bares no responsibility? Seriously, it's like a karate instructor taking a van full of his 12 year old students to a crack house and telling them to go make some citizens arrests. I'm sorry but I respect Pro too much as a debater to think that he believes his argument. What Batman has done - providing children with weapons, instructing them to fight, teaching them to break the law, etc. - isn't just bad parenting. It is the very definition of child abuse, neglect, and endangerment [1][2]. Even if we used the perspective of a child, as Pro would like us to do, the sight of the heroic Caped Crusader leading his own biological and adopted children to their eventual brutal deaths is hard to admire. Well, at least he doesn't actually physically assault them himself or anything... ...and my personal favorite: Counter-Arguments Batman is...a good guy? Pro seems to concede my point here by agreeing that there is a difference between doing a ""good"" act and being, on balance, a ""good"" role model. He states that the Joker's crime fighting doesn't change his negative nature. Similarly, Batman's crime fighting does not change his sociopathic criminality. The difference is that I, like our criminal justice system and society at large, do not believe that good intentions alleviate someone of their wrongdoing. There is a reason manslaughter is a crime; intentionality of a bad deed may influence the extent of one's punishment but it doesn't erase it and it certainly doesn't make the perpetrator a good person. Batman vs. the Police Pro seems to think it is my burden to prove why recklessly and dangerously taking the law into your own hands is wrong. By this point I have made that reason abundantly clear, but that demand still strikes me as odd. In any case, Pro concedes that it is the responsibility of the police, not Batman, to maintain and enforce societal good. Batman's actions, which rest completely outside the law and forces him to interfere with their operations constantly, serves largely to obstruct their mission and waste their resources. A perfect example of Batman hindering justice is Pro's example of supposed selflessness. At the end of The Dark Knight, Batman takes the blame for Harvey Dent's murders. Pro wrongly attributes this to Gotham City's need for ""a person to hate."" As I explained previously, Batman admired Dent because Dent's motives were pure and his actions legal, as opposed to his own psychotic lawbreaking. Now, Batman decides to lie to the entire city and use countless governmental resources and manpower hunting him down for the one crime he didn't commit. Once again he gets in the way of the actual law enforcers and takes them away from solving actual crimes. This ""sacrifice"" is actually making Gotham less safe.

In any case, Pro concedes that it is the responsibility of the police, not Batman, to maintain and enforce societal good. Batman’s actions, which rest completely outside the law and forces him to interfere with their operations constantly, serves largely to obstruct their mission and waste their resources.   A perfect example of Batman hindering justice is Pro’s example of supposed selflessness. At the end of The Dark Knight, Batman takes the blame for Harvey Dent’s murders. Pro wrongly attributes this to Gotham City’s need for “a person to hate.” As I explained previously, Batman admired Dent because Dent's motives were pure and his actions legal, as opposed to his own psychotic lawbreaking. Now, Batman decides to lie to the entire city and use countless governmental resources and manpower hunting him down for the one crime he didn’t commit. Once again he gets in the way of the actual law enforcers and takes them away from solving actual crimes. This “sacrifice” is actually making Gotham less safe.   I look forward to my opponent’s final round.   References  1.   http://www.childwelfare.gov...  2.   http://www.legalmatch.com...",Miscellaneous,2,Choose/5/,10737

219,"I will be arguing that kids in junior high school should not have cell phones. Unfortunately this is only a one-round debate, so my contentions will go unrefuted, whereas I will have time to address and rebut my opponent's arguments. He first claims that ""If junior high kids did not have cell phones it would not be very fun for the students."" This is an interesting jump for kids to students, as not all students are kids and not all kids are students -- I think it would be fascinating to find a non-kid as a student in junior high school, but I digress. First, my opponent appears to be suggesting that ""it"" isn't fun for students without cell phones. What is ""it""? School? If it's school, then the obvious response is that (1) school is not intended to be fun; it's intended as a place to hone young minds and equip them with the tools they need to grow and flourish into responsible, intelligent adults (2) why would you want to use a cell phone in school, where students are already prone to distraction? It would merely enable students to hold background conversations while they should be listening to their teachers and allow them to, if they so choose, cheat and (3) does not contribute to their learning in any way -- if it did contribute, Pro has not provided us with how it does, so we must assume that it dos not. There's also the point that ""fun"" is subjective and some students may find school fun, any way, simply because they love to learn. I happened to be one of these kids, actually. If Pro is simply making a general statement that having cell phones is fun, then the same basic reasoning applies: (1) fun is subjective (2) fun is not an argument unto itself; just because something is fun doesn't mean you should do it. For instance, toilet-papering a house is fun, but that doesn't mean that I should do it (3) it is possible to have fun without a cell phone (4) you can't exactly miss what you have never been exposed to, so saying that ""it would not be fun"" is simply unfounded (5) the negative ramifications -- cheating, distractions, etc. -- outweigh the benefits. Pro then claims that cell phones would be useful tools, but gives us only one example: communication. First, to communicate with whom? Their friends while they are still in class? I've demonstrated why this is potentially dangerous. How about with their parents? This is ostensibly plausible, but not only is there not a need for it -- in junior high school, many students either take the bus home, carpool with their friends, or have their parents pick them up, anyway -- but the negative ramifications, again, outweigh the benefits. Communication during the school day merely invites problems, especially when we're discussing junior high school students, who are by definition young and immature. Now that I have refuted my opponent's contentions, I will offer my own: 1. Junior High Students are Young and Immature This merely goes without saying, and people can look back to their junior high days when they were about 11, 12, or 13 and consider what they did when they were in school. This is a matter of trusting these children with a device that is potentially dangerous and could potentially cost their parents quite a pretty penny. 2. Monetary Cost-Benefit Analysis Cell phone bills are VERY expensive. While it could be ""fun"" to have a cell phone -- again, fun is subjective -- there is no evidence whatsoever that it is NECESSARY. Young children do not need a fun for communication or for any other reason because they are still minors and their parents still provide for them, so this is simply a waste of money for their parents, many of whom are already struggling amid this economy. This also gets to the point about maturity. Some phone plans -- mine, for instance, because I'm a poor PhD student who effectively lives in the Stone Age -- charge per text. Therefore, the kids are left either without texting, which takes the ""fun"" out of it, or because they're immature and disobedient to authority, they opt to text anyway even if their parents asked them not to, and cost their parents quite a lot of money. 3. Cell Phones are Dangerous Let's ignore for a minute the cancer risks from cell phone radiation and so forth. Using a cell phone is effectively using an unbelievable tool whereby you can contact anyone in the world at any point in time. At the same time, people can contact you, can add your number to lists, can attempt to steal your identity, etc. Can we trust young children with that kind of responsibility? Pro has provided us with no reason why we should. Conclusion I have negated the resolution. Please Vote Con.",1,JohnMaynardKeynes,"

Response: First, you still have your anonymity. Second, the First Amendment says nothing about anonymity. Claim 8: All that remains here is what's safe and approved of. Response: Indeed. There are terms of service which we must all agree to before using this site. For instance, profanity is disallowed. This is because this site is intended for people of all ages and all walks of life. We are also not supposed to insult each other and such. This is because the creators of the site wanted a safe, friendly place for people to have a meaningful exchange of ideas, rather than a site filled with flaming and trolling. Even so, this point is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand, since identity confirmation does not remove any content. Claim 9: No real discussion can happen under these conditions. Response: Then what is this? What is the comments area? No discussion is stopped or limited due to identity confirmation. Claim 10: This site has become a classic example of how intellectual property law destroys innovation. Response: Intellectual property laws have nothing to do with identity confirmation. Also, what innovation is being destroyed? Claim 11: This page does not deserve ownership of its domain. Response: They paid for it, and they put a lot of work into making a great site around it. My opponent gives no reason why they do not deserve their domain, and even if he did, that point would be completely and utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand, like most of the claims my opponent has made. Now, I will tell you why the need for identity confirmation is not absurd. As a long-time member of this site, surely my opponent knows of the utter blight multiple accounts were on the voting outcomes of debates. As one of the older members of the site, let me assure you that it has been a major problem in the past. Luckily, the debate.org staff came up with a good way to limit the usage of multiple accounts without causing other big problems. Identity confirmation.

Response: Really? In person it's not. Even so, how is this identity confirmation limiting anyone's anonymity? No one on this site has any idea who you are unless you make that information known yourself. That's anonymity, and it's intact.  
  
Claim 7: Stripping anonymity is limiting First Amendment rights.  
Response: First, you still have your anonymity. Second, the First Amendment says nothing about anonymity.  
  
Claim 8: All that remains here is what's safe and approved of.  
Response: Indeed. There are terms of service which we must all agree to before using this site. For instance, profanity is disallowed. This is because this site is intended for people of all ages and all walks of life. We are also not supposed to insult each other and such. This is because the creators of the site wanted a safe, friendly place for people to have a meaningful exchange of ideas, rather than a site filled with flaming and trolling.  
Even so, this point is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand, since identity confirmation does not remove any content.  
  
Claim 9: No real discussion can happen under these conditions.  
Response: Then what is this? What is the comments area? No discussion is stopped or limited due to identity confirmation.  
  
Claim 10: This site has become a classic example of how intellectual property law destroys innovation.  
Response: Intellectual property laws have nothing to do with identity confirmation. Also, what innovation is being destroyed?  
  
Claim 11: This page does not deserve ownership of its domain.  
Response: They paid for it, and they put a lot of work into making a great site around it. My opponent gives no reason why they do not deserve their domain, and even if he did, that point would be completely and utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand, like most of the claims my opponent has made.  
  
Now, I will tell you why the need for identity confirmation is not absurd. As a long-time member of this site, surely my opponent knows of the utter blight multiple accounts were on the voting outcomes of debates. As one of the older members of the site, let me assure you that it has been a major problem in the past. Luckily, the debate.org staff came up with a good way to limit the usage of multiple accounts without causing other big problems. Identity confirmation. It serves a very much needed purpose, so one could hardly call it absurd.

230,"While I agree that there is merit to the idea of pedophilia being punishable by life sentences, I strongly object to my opponent's logial backing for this idea; his argument can best be summed up as, ""pedophilia is similar to homosexuality. Homosexuality is not based on choice, so neither is pedophilia. If pedophilia is not based on choice, then once a criminally-inclined pedophile, always a criminally-inclined pedophile."" In reality, the argument is about the possibility of ""reforming"" homosexuals. I will first highlight a few sentences of my opponent's argument in particular: ""A bi-sexual clearly makes a choice as to their preference on any given day."" Actually, no, a bisexual is attracted to both in general (sometimes leaning towards one gender). It's not a choice of preference, it's an allowance of both - in other words, avoidance of the choice. ""Why is it a homosexual can not be rehabilitated but a pedophile can. There is no scientific logic here. One can only come to the logical conclusion. If a pedophile can be reformed a homosexual can be reformed. If a homosexual cannot be reformed than a pedophile cannot be reformed."" That's like saying, if an orange can be skinned without using a knife, so can an apple, and if an apple cannot be skinned with a knife, then an orange cannot. My opponent's ""logical conclusion"" relies on a basic similarity between pedophilia and homosexuality that is not there. They do not work on the same system, and what applies to one does not necessarily apply to the other. For one thing, one is based on abuse, while the other is not. For another, one is caused more by issues while another by biological factors - though there is enough controversy about the causes of both for me to not use this argument at the moment. ""If the later is true then a pedophile should never be let out of prison once they commit an act of pedophilia of any kind."" Here's the thing: being a pedophile means being sexually attracted to children. This is a BAD THING, but it is not the same as acting on pedophilic urges. A pedophile is not a criminal nor a morally bad person unless they either abuse or attempt to abuse children - in other words, it is possible to be sexually attracted to children at the same time as not DOING anything wrong, which would certainly be part of reforming a pedophile. Therefore, sentencing pedophiles to life sentences would be something done based on the magnitude of the crime, NOT on the likelihood of another crime. The main question here is - should somebody be jailed for potential crimes they may commit? Generally speaking, that's what intensive therapy is for. Do I believe that acts of pedophilia should result in life sentences? In some cases, I definitely do. Do I believe that a non-life sentence can be justifiably extended to a life sentence as a precaution? Definitely not. There are already precautions in place for convicted pedophiles - registries, prohibitions, etc. Jail as a precaution is an unacceptable corruption of the justice system. ""It is politics that is separating the homosexuals from the pedophiles with regard to the rehabilitation argument."" No, it's science and logic. I'm going to skimp out on the science here, because any sources we throw at each-other will be immediately rejected (though if my opponent is willing to play that game, I'll certainly join in in round 2). Here's the logic, though. Homosexuality is revolves around a relationship between two consenting adults. Children are in no way involved. Nobody is harmed, unless they haven't taken precautions, but because they're consenting adults, that's their own fault. In other words, homosexuality is victimless. Pedophilia, however, is just another form of rape. That's not politics, that's thinking. ""And it is done so at the expense of the children."" The statement comes immediately following the last one I commented on (""It is politics that is separating the homosexuals from the pedophiles with regard to the rehabilitation argument"") so the point is obvious - homosexuality is harming our children. Again, the reason homosexuality is different from pedophilia is because one of them doesn't involve the rape of children - or any type of rape at all, for that matter.* To say that there is no difference between them in that context is the same as saying that a child is harmed by being aware of alternate lifestyles as much as by being the victim of rape and molestation. That is extremely illogical. It's also an elegant trap - one cannot help but agree with condemning pedophiles (unless one wants to look a pedophile supporter); to agree with life-long sentences for pedophiles is to agree with part of my opponent's argument, so, if one gets caught up in the ""save our children"" hype, one can easily be led to believe that to love our children is to hate homosexuals. My opponent's argument is based two false premises: that pedophilia is a sexual orientation (""If this were true then simple logic dictates that a pedophile is also born that way and they cannot help but be a pedophile""), and that being a pedophile and committing acts of pedophilia are the same thing. The following links in my opponent's logic chain are, therefore, invalid: ""Pedophilia is similar to homosexuality,"" and ""If pedophilia is not based on choice, then once a criminally-inclined pedophile, always a criminally-inclined pedophile."" Should we punish (acts of) pedophilia? Yes.

235,"I thank my opponent for this debate topic. First, you are slightly misrepresenting my argument. I'm not claiming that luck was what brought Hitler to power, but that it's a significant factor to his rise of power. As I argued in the previous round, I claimed that an operational version of your proposed definition is to measure how much the social influence said individual caused due to his own will and not to external circumstances that simply involve him. In other words, you aren't a great leader simply because times were good under your rule and you get lucky - a good measurement of what deems one to be a great leader is when you can point at a change as a consequence of their choice. Discriminating between this distinction is important, as my argument lessens Hitler's status as an incredible leader. I am not denying that Hitler was a great orator, and I am not denying that even under the circumstances Germany was in during the 30's it is still a hurdle to rally the country as Hitler did. However, I am claiming that this isn't as grand as you may express it to be -- after all, while effort is needed it basically consists of a large, susceptible country who have been charmed by the idealistic (but ultimately false) promises of their leader. Further unbeknown to them were the political dirty work Hitler did to squeal any possible political problem. To add to my point, after Hitler basically became the supreme commander of Germany, he displayed numerous times disastrous failures on his part, both political and military. While Alexander made huge mistakes as well, his track record is much better than Hitler's (his undefeated military record being a notable mention). =================== Alexander the Great ==================== Before I reference Alexander the Great, I want to note a sense of vagueness in this debate. The title implies that Hitler can, at the very least, be at par with other leaders. However, this is made unclear as in your second round you claim that if I can provide a better leader, I would negate your position. This would imply that you posit Hitler to be the greatest leader of all time -- I suppose at this point there is no way you can clarify, but I will work off this interpretation. First, both Hitler and Alexander were military commanders, but the latter is obviously superior. His tactics are still being studied today, and he is commonly stated to be undefeated in battle (that is, despite the near-mutiny in India he has yet to lose a battle). Perhaps there are qualitative differences between political and military leaders, but first of all Hitler was one of the latter AND Alexander particularly shines in this role as he was apt with achieving a cohesive army for the most part of his legendary campaigns. In terms of social influence (per your definition), Alexander introduced lasting influence with his most obvious contribution being Hellenistic civilization. Hitler mainly caused large turmoil and damage, but this isn't anything socially significant except to perhaps motivate many History channel documentaries, or more seriously lead to some other political conflicts. However, I don't count this into the equation as he probably didn't want to will these side effects - his goal was quite different, obviously. Again, remember that evaluating a leader even under your definition should be confined under the focus of their intent. Alexander is clearly a superior leader given his ability to consolidate the many nation-states of Greece, amazing tactical ability in foreign land and against great odds (his army rarely succeeded 40K and were commonly far from supply lines), plus his ability to leave not wastelands but structured civilizations. Founding cities, canals, ports, etc. was what he accomplished as he spread throughout countries, meaning he wasn't a senseless barbarian. Plus, the guy was just plain bad@ss - he fought in the front lines, and conquered a vast majority of the known world at the age most people graduate from universities ;)",1,TheSkeptic,"

Or saying that fighting for sexual equality fights to harm non-LGBT individuals. When, in reality, gender equality (and equality in general) is focused around giving equal rights to both sexes, and eliminating the struggles that are produced from patriarchy. Such struggles include: A) Women being misrepresented in politics. B) Rape of both men by women (out of a sense that men are viewed as people who will always accept and appreciate sex willingly) and women by men (out of a perception that women can be viewed as sexual objects). C) Objectification of women in the media. D) Discrimination against those who slip out of their socio-gender normative, simply because they wish to be more individualistic (Ex: passive gay men being compared to women. Which itself is a main lead for same-sex rape within prisons, as passive gay men (or simply men who don't fit within a tough enough veil of masculinity) become to be seen as easy substitutes to women as sex objects). E) Child abuse by mothers/fathers who force their children to mold into a gender normative (Ex: male children being abused for being to 'effeminate', and female children being abused for being to 'masculine'). F) Slut-shaming, which can lead to depression and suicide (as with the case of Amanda Todd[1]).

Going back to the selection process Naruto was considered for the part back then but they were looking for him to mature. During the great ninja war he has shown much more maturity and far greater ability. 3. Sasuke's Criminal actions. Are you forgetting that Sasuke will be charged as a criminal at the end of the war? He may be pardoned by the Hokage for his help during the great battle but he is guilty of assassinating the 6th Hokage Danzo. His actions of assassinating Danzo will be considered a crime against the entire village which he will face charges against after the war. I am not claiming he will face punishment but it will greatly hinder his chance to even be allowed to take part in the Hokage selection process. <URL>... 4. Traditions and bloodlines. In the story of Naruto, the village has maintained a consistant pattern of keeping the position within a bloodline.

240,"C1: Economic Growth If you look up Afghanistan's GDP, it increased *faster* after NATO involvement. It was falling *prior* to NATO involvement in the region.[1] ""The economy of Afghanistan has improved significantly since 2002 due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and investments""[2] Extractive institutions inhibit economic growth as people are not incentivized to produce. Inclusive institutions--imposed by the NATO regime--allow people to have private property and there are greater incentives to work and produce. Therefore, had the Taliban been allowed to control the country, economic growth would have been much less than we have seen. Inclusive institutions have been found, throughout history, to increase economic growth. Whereas extractive institutions decrease growth. (Why Nations Fail, book). Therefore, NATO's involvement in the Afghan economic system have benefited the people of Afghanistan. C2: Political Stability NATO has assisted Afghan security forces in building a system which will prevent future terrorist groups from taking over the country. Preventing terrorist forces from reoccupying Afghanistan is one of the main reasons the international community has dedicated itself to assisting Afghanistan. The governments from all around the world have been giving aid to Afghanistan, which has drastically increased economic growth and stability in the region. The UK alone has pledged to give 178 million pounds per year throughout 2012 - 2017. This aid will assist Afghanistan in ""maintain[ing] its own security and prevent the return of international terrorists."" <URL>... ... As noted above, the economic security of Afghanistan has increased dramatically due to foreign intervention. This contributes greatly to the political system, which has a steady flow of income due to foreign investments. Investors prefer countries where the political systems are predictable and easy to understand. This has occurred in Afghanistan due to NATO's assistance. The stability will lead to economic growth, military stability, and a functioning political system where more people can voice their opinions. All of this, which can be traced to NATO's efforts, has helped the country and it's people. The UK, for example, is committed towards helping the new Afghan government. A stable government is the only sure way to ""secure peace and stability"". <URL>... ... In fact, Afghanistan has gone from a dysfunctional state before NATO's involvement to a state where the people can rely on their government for security. NATO merely two dozen patrols each day, whereas the Afghanistan security forces do the rest. The Afghan forces control all but 70 of the 852 bases inside the country. In previous years, NATO would complete hundreds of patrols per day and oversaw almost every military base. However, lessons from Iraq tell us that if NATO leaves prematurely instability may again ensue. It has been noted by many analysts that NATO presence helps the country, and that leaving too soon will put the country at risk. It has been recommended that NATO continues to have 'troops on the ground' in order to continue a stable government. <URL>... ... In fact, much of the issues of stability are related to NATO leaving the country. Therefore, NATO presence increased stability in he country. ""Afghanistan's security situation is likely to deteriorate if U.S. and other foreign forces withdraw"" <URL>... ... In order for elections to be ""free"", NATO forces must stay in the region in order to combat the Taliban, which has been working to subvert the election processes in Afghanistan. Therefore, if anything, NATO involvement should *increase*, not decrease, in order to maximize stability. Later when if they claim that Afghan security forces are harming the country, this notes how Afghani security forces have dramatically improved under NATO supervision and have ""performed adequately"". <URL>... ... ""In southern Afghanistan, security has improved in Kandahar City and in the Arghandab River Valley to the west"" Also security operations in the east of the country ""have decreased insurgent ability to refit and resupply for the coming summer fighting season"" (above link; long war journal) C3: Better Infrastructure Before NATO involvement, most of Afghanistan had any modern infrastructure. In fact, most rural areas had absolutely zero infrastructure. US involvement alone has led to more people having access to clean water, electricity, an improved electrical grid, and 500 medical facilities. Including help from all of the nations put together, there are 600 medical facilities that have been created. The involvement has dramatically increased the well being of the average Afghanistan citizen. NATO is now working with the local government in order to maintain these improvements. ""In 2002, only six percent of Afghans had access to reliable power; today, more than 28% do. . . . USAID has invested more than $2 billion on the construction and rehabilitation of more than 2,000 kilometers (km) of roads, including Afghanistan""s Ring Road, which connects the country""s five major cities . . .

USAID erected two high schools for 12,000 students in Kabul City and four provincial teacher-training centers in Faryab, Nangarhar, Parwan, and Wardak, and six faculties of higher education facilities in Bamyan, Parwan, Herat, Balkh, Jawzjan and Faryab."" <URL>... ...

Therefore, had the Taliban been allowed to control the country, economic growth would have been much less than we have seen. Inclusive institutions have been found, throughout history, to increase economic growth. Whereas extractive institutions decrease growth. (Why Nations Fail, book). Therefore, NATO's involvement in the Afghan economic system have benefited the people of Afghanistan.  
  
  C2: Political Stability  
  
NATO has assisted Afghan security forces in building a system which will prevent future terrorist groups from taking over the country. Preventing terrorist forces from reoccupying Afghanistan is one of the main reasons the international community has dedicated itself to assisting Afghanistan.  
  
The governments from all around the world have been giving aid to Afghanistan, which has drastically increased economic growth and stability in the region. The UK alone has pledged to give 178 million pounds per year throughout 2012 - 2017. This aid will assist Afghanistan in ""maintain[ing] its own security and prevent the return of international terrorists.""  
  https://www.gov.uk...  ...  
  
As noted above, the economic security of Afghanistan has increased dramatically due to foreign intervention. This contributes greatly to the political system, which has a steady flow of income due to foreign investments. Investors prefer countries where the political systems are predictable and easy to understand. This has occurred in Afghanistan due to NATO's assistance. The stability will lead to economic growth, military stability, and a functioning political system where more people can voice their opinions. All of this, which can be traced to NATO's efforts, has helped the country and it's people.  
  
The UK, for example, is committed towards helping the new Afghan government. A stable government is the only sure way to ""secure peace and stability"".  
  https://www.gov.uk...  ...  
  
In fact, Afghanistan has gone from a dysfunctional state before NATO's involvement to a state where the people can rely on their government for security. NATO merely two dozen patrols each day, whereas the Afghanistan security forces do the rest. The Afghan forces control all but 70 of the 852 bases inside the country. In previous years, NATO would complete hundreds of patrols per day and oversaw almost every military base. However, lessons from Iraq tell us that if NATO leaves prematurely instability may again ensue. It has been noted by many analysts that NATO presence helps the country, and that leaving too soon will put the country at risk. It has been recommended that NATO continues to have 'troops on the ground' in order to continue a stable government.  
  http://www.heritage.org...  ...  
  
In fact, much of the issues of stability are related to NATO leaving the country. Therefore, NATO presence increased stability in he country.  
""Afghanistan's security situation is likely to deteriorate if U.S. and other foreign forces withdraw""  
  http://www.cfr.org...  ...  
In order for elections to be ""free"", NATO forces must stay in the region in order to combat the Taliban, which has been working to subvert the election processes in Afghanistan. Therefore, if anything, NATO involvement should *increase*, not decrease, in order to maximize stability.  
  
Later when if they claim that Afghan security forces are harming the country, this notes how Afghani security forces have dramatically improved under NATO supervision and have ""performed adequately"".  
  http://www.longwarjournal.org...  ...  
  
""In southern Afghanistan, security has improved in Kandahar City and in the Arghandab River Valley to the west""  
Also security operations in the east of the country ""have decreased insurgent ability to refit and resupply for the coming summer fighting season"" (above link; long war journal)  
  
  C3: Better Infrastructure  
  
Before NATO involvement, most of Afghanistan had any modern infrastructure. In fact, most rural areas had absolutely zero infrastructure. US involvement alone has led to more people having access to clean water, electricity, an improved electrical grid, and 500 medical facilities. Including help from all of the nations put together, there are 600 medical facilities that have been created. The involvement has dramatically increased the well being of the average Afghanistan citizen. NATO is now working with the local government in order to maintain these improvements.  
  
""In 2002, only six percent of Afghans had access to reliable power; today, more than 28% do. . . . USAID has invested more than $2 billion on the construction and rehabilitation of more than 2,000 kilometers (km) of roads, including Afghanistan""s Ring Road, which connects the country""s five major cities . . . The Afghan government and USAID have constructed more than 3,000 wells, primarily in rural communities, to provide reliable clean water for the first time to more than 615,000 Afghans, and nearly 33,000 latrines help to prevent the spread of disease . . . USAID erected two high schools for 12,000 students in Kabul City and four provincial teacher-training centers in Faryab, Nangarhar, Parwan, and Wardak, and six faculties of higher education facilities in Bamyan, Parwan, Herat, Balkh, Jawzjan and Faryab.""

Therefore, once again water is more than just 'drinking' or 'bottled water' but rather a supply for many tasks we need to do in life. 2) Yes, there are worldwide systems and organizations, but they are insufficient to provide every people with water supplies. If those organizations were so great and so effective, how can the nations and people suffering from unapproachable water be existent? I believe that domestic governmental effort through making the water public works much better and efficient. The failures of water privatization is mentioned in my first round's arguments through the examples Great Britain(developed country), and Tanzania(developing country). Let me provide you with some of the successes that public water supply systems have made; Germany has a public system with very low distribution losses; 100% of the urban areas have access while 97% of the rural areas are granted of access. For both urban and rural areas, over 90% has the high sanitation rate. In Denmark, 100% of the population gets water supplies, with more than 87% of high sanitation rate. For the example of a developing country, we have Costa Rica - nearly 90% or the rural areas are granted access, and with almost all of the urban areas getting the supply as well. These data proves that public water systems are certainly more efficient in providing the public with water with good quality and efficiency. 3) My opponent has stated 'there are places where you can get free water'. However, he/she did not state such specific places, and it is not proved. And EVEN IF there were to be places with free water, still people would have to carry the water they need all the way home - which is very inefficient compared to the water pipe systems. 4) ""people who don't work or don't go out into the world and get a job should not get water"" ; means that if one does not have money or a job, they should not be granted the access to water. However, let's keep in mind that no money and no job is caused from lack of efforts. So what about people that are born in adverse conditions? If they have money, does that mean their water supplies, a vital source, has to be cut? A nation and a government should be ready to provide its people, at least a VERY BASIC LIFE SOURCE, instead of abandoning them. 5) There are certain RIGHTS that are granted to people regardless of their jobs or status in money- such as rights to life, freedom of speech, rights to be protected, rights to vote, and so on. And water is one of those sources that should be granted and be provided by the government. Today, I have proved to you that water should NOT be privatized through suggesting; 1) Explaining the nature and qualities of water being a necessary life source and why it should be provided by the government, 2) Explain the Nature of the private companies and how their preference on profits over people can cause harm, plus the comparison with the public water systems which were successful, 3) Possible environmental harms that can come with privatizing water Plus I believe I have rebutted my opponent successfully. However, I haven't really seen a direct rebuttal to theses arguments from my opponent. Plus, what I have seen in the arguments of my opponents were vague. 1) My opponent firstly misunderstood the privatization of water - when it should have been considering the supply of overall water, my opponent has only considered 'bottled water' which was a very limited topic. 2) He/she was also irresponsible in providing people with fair and equal source of water- and when I pointed out the responsibilities of the government and necessity of water supply, I haven't heard the response to that. 3) 'Worldwide systems and organizations of water' or 'free sources' of water were what my opponent suggested. However, they were not specified. Plus, getting water supplies to everybody from those water systems are very impractical - but my opponent as ignored these factors. 4) I haven't seen any reason from my opponent on WHY companies are more efficient or better in providing people with water sources, or why companies can manage the water systems better without harming the environment. 5) Not just these reasons, but I haven't seen a solid argument or a reasoning in my opponent's arguments, and therefore, I do not exactly know what possible solutions or suggestions that were suggested by my opponent. He/she was merely irresponsible, and while he/she tried to tackle my arguments, because they were vague and illogical, they do not stand.(please refer to my rebuttals) Water, once a gain, is a source that is directly related to the rights of life.

These wars spread across planet earth like wildfire, destroying everything in its path. These wars are without a doubt, unpardonable. Though, this does not mean that all war is unjustified. Although most people do not want to admit it, there is such a thing as a necessary evil. Take the ""Trolly problem"" scenario: "" A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you - your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?"" Or what about the ""Ticking Time bomb"" scenario: ""There is a terrorist in custody who has hid a bomb in New York City. The bomb is set to explode in thirty minutes and is going to kill thousands of innocent people. Would it be ok to torture the terrorist to get the location of the bombed out of him?"" When morals contradict morals, people tend to back away from the subject. But you can see what I am getting at here. Many people will come up with arguments of how it wouldn't be moral to push the fat man or torture the terrorist, but the facts are still there, it would be better to do so. The same could be said about war. Many people suffer at the hand of their government, take North Korea for example. The government keeps their people hidden in the dark, if you do not comply with their orders, you are either killed in a gruesome way, or thrown in an inhumane prison. North Korea has a concentration camp known only as ""Camp 22."" Camp 22 was established in 1959. As of today, there are an estimated 50,000 prisoners held in Camp 22. Most have been imprisoned because relatives were critical of the Korean Workers' Party or its General Secretary, Kim Jong-il. Analysis of satellite imagery suggests that the camp is surrounded by guarded fences. Housing is clustered in fairly small groups. Reasons for housing the prisoners in this fashion are unclear, but could be to decrease the risk of rebellion. There have even been accounts of chemical experimentation on prisoners using a glass gas chamber for observation. This is just one of many prisons in North Korea. So many people are suffering at the hand of this horrible government. Now, if there was a nation that wished to stand up for what is right and take down North Korea's evil government would it be wrong? Would it be wrong to kill some people in North Korea's army in order to save its civilians? Of course not! Now, what about revolutions? In 1775, thirteen British colonies rebelled against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The thirteen colonies decided that they wanted freedom from Great Britain's rule. They wanted to be free from the over priced tax, and they also wanted freedom of religion. Britain was being overbearing and cruel to the colonies. The colonies started the war with Britain and won. After the war, they claimed their independence and later became The United States of America. Surely you can agree that this war also is justified. If you for some odd reason disagree with the two examples above, surely you will not be able to tell yourself that the following example is unjustified. The example that I speak of is invasions of our territory. Let us say that the USA is tired of Canada's export tax on its yummy maple syrup and wants to take them over. So, they send over troops to take down their government. Canada, of course, fights back. By defending her homeland, Canada is starting a war. This war is of course justified. Would it be better just to surrender? No way! If that were the case, The United States of America could be taken over by Jamaica, Mexico, or North Korea! It is obvious that this would not work. On December 7th, 1941 353 Japanese air crafts attacked Pearl Harbor, the next day the USA entered World War Two. The Japanese accomplished exactly what they wanted to do, their goal was to bring the United States into the war. But, it was of course necessary for the USA to enter. It is easy to see that the USA had no other choice then to enter the war; therefore, entering World War Two was justified. Many people today want to feel like they are that someone to stand up against all the bloodshed. They want to come together and say 'enough is enough.' But what these people do not understand is that mankind is not perfect. If mankind was perfect, there would be no need for war. But people are never content with what they have.

As such IF Con admits I refuted their penal theory defense, I declare Con the winner, and thus IF con does this urge voters to vote Con, infact If Con admits that I refuted their penal atonement defense, I urge voters to vote bomb for him. There is your precious win, take it punk, I mean you do want to win right ? It means so much to you, you are willing to resort to word play on the resolution ? so go on, just admit I refuted your defense of penal atonement, and I concede defeat and you the winner of this debate. If Con does not concede that I refuted their defense of penal atonement then I don't concede defeat, then I refer voters to round 1 and 2, where this was actually debated to decided who won. So whats it gonna be Con ?",1,Illegalcombatant,"
  
I think it is quite clear that Con wants to win on a technical point, and not the core issues at had. If you care more about winning this debate on a technical point rather than all the issues referred to in the first round, you do that.  
  
Con says ""In terms of arguing about the historicity of the New Testament, or anything like that. Your resolution does not state ""The concept of Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable."" It states that ""Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable."" If you did not want to argue about the historic event, then you need to learn to craft your resolutions more carefully, or more clearly define them in your opening round.""  
  
I have no idea why Con would accept this debate when I had said this in the first round....  
  
""Elaboration on what it means that ""Jesus died for our/your sins""  
  
I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........  
  
1) Everyone is a sinner  
2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness  
3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners""  
  
You know exactly what I was arguing against, you can't appeal to ignorance.  
  
I am not going to ask for an apology, but I think you should apologize to the people who read this debate, looking too see objections and a defense on this whole Jesus died for our sins, and so forth.  
  
I am not impressed, maybe next time I will get some one who will defend it.  
  
Tell you what Con, you want to win so bad, just admit that I squashed your pathetic defense of penal atonement, and I will concede you as the winner of this debate.

First of all, school uniforms encourage discipline by making students focus on studying and homework rather than new clothes. In the morning, instead of worrying on different outfits, students can do school related activities like organizing their backpack, double-checking their homework, or studying. Students spend a lot of time thinking about clothing, but now, since they have uniforms, they no longer have to go through tedious shopping or hours of decisions of what to wear. School uniforms also help students resist the urge to buy designer clothing. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, the only time new clothes are nexus are weekends, holidays, and summer break, which is a lot less clothes than the entire school year. Clothes can often be used to define social statuses, but if there are no different clothes, people will have to rely on personality rather than the outfit they are wearing. In schools, some students are poor while others are rich. Poor students may have scholarships in order to afford school and have ragged clothes, while rich students may be supported by very wealthy parents and have expensive, fancy clothes.

255,"There are three inalienable rights that binds America together: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And we the people have the duty to reject and condemn any law or policy that seeks to deny any American these essential rights. The Marriage Amendment or amendment 2 to the Florida constitution is a deceitful effort by conservative religious groups in the state of Florida to deny brilliant, artistic, caring, innovative, and friendly people the right to seek their happiness by denying them the most sacred form of expressing love to one another. I'm talking of course of these groups trying to deny homosexuals the right to marry in the state of Florida. Lets first start off by proving the advantages the LGBT community brings to a state. Michelle Garcia of the Washington Post reports that ""the city council and Mayor Michael Bloomberg have increased police patrols, despite statistics showing that the area has one of the city's lowest crime rates."" The area she is referring to is the Christopher Street part of the West Village in New York City. This area is not only a very large and almost all gay neighborhood, but also where the infamous Stonewall Riots that catapulted the Gay rights movement took place. Not only does the gay community consistently have lower crime rates but it also has a more culturally diverse and artistic culture. A glance at many of broadway male actors profiles will reveal a huge percentage of actors are gay and well represented in race, national origin, and age. Before I explain why we should not vote on this proposal, I will reveal the areas of Florida that will be particularly hurt and outraged by this amendment. In South Florida, we have in the city of Miami the gay area of South Beach. In the keys, Key West has a very large percentage of GLBT citizens. In Fort Lauderdale, there is Wilton Manors, parts of downtown Ft. Lauderdale, and Davie. And in Central Florida, Tampa, Orlando, and other areas will particularly be hurt. These people are tax paying citizens who wish to be able to one day say those two special words to the person they love, I Do. Moving on to the reasons why you should reject this amendment. Nadine Smith, Co-Chair of Fairness for All Families states, ""it takes away legal protections from unmarried couples; gay or straight. It prevents civil unions, comprehensive domestic partnerships and removes existing legal benefits. There are about 360,000 unmarried couples in the state according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which there are roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples."" This shows that voting for this amendment will harm a significant group of Floridians that could otherwise by left unharmed by voting no. If you also look at what happened in Michigan people had said that they wouldn't go after domestic partnership and civil union benefits once an amendment very similar to this one passed. They immediately after the election starting removed health, medical, legal, and financial benefits. Smith also goes on to state, ""this amendment is not taking away gay marriage, because the legal statues already do that. But what it does do is make it alot harder for us to care for the ones that we love. When Michigan took away domestic partnerships it didn't make married relationships any better, but what it did do is remove the benefits that gay couples had and made it alot harder for them to care for their families and the ones that they love."" To protect the integrity of the Florida constitution and to reconfirm our commitment to ALL of our citizens regardless of their race ,color ,sex , national origin , and sexual orientation.

There are about 360,000 unmarried couples in the state according to the U.S. Census Bureau, of which there are roughly 40,000 gay and lesbian couples."" This shows that voting for this amendment will harm a significant group of Floridians that could otherwise by left unharmed by voting no. If you also look at what happened in Michigan people had said that they wouldn't go after domestic partnership and civil union benefits once an amendment very similar to this one passed. They immediately after the election starting removed health, medical, legal, and financial benefits.  
  
Smith also goes on to state, ""this amendment is not taking away gay marriage, because the legal statues already do that. But what it does do is make it alot harder for us to care for the ones that we love. When Michigan took away domestic partnerships it didn't make married relationships any better, but what it did do is remove the benefits that gay couples had and made it alot harder for them to care for their families and the ones that they love."" To protect the integrity of the Florida constitution and to reconfirm our commitment to ALL of our citizens regardless of their race ,color ,sex , national origin , and sexual orientation. I urge you all to vote NO on the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment.",Politics,0,The-State-of-Florida-should-vote-No-on-the-Florida-Marriage-Protection-Amendment-in-November./1/,61805

But, there would also be many benefits to making cars illegal. With pretty much anything, there are pros and cons. I believe that there would be more cons to illegalizing smoking. I will list a few below. 1. Freedom. There are already many people saying that it is there right to take any drugs they want. I do not know completely if this is true, but there would be an uproar of angry people who believe that smoking is there right. America was built on freedom. Every day that freedom is leaving us little by little. Allowing the government to stop people from smoking is simply a-foot-in-the-door. Do you think that the government should ban chocolate cake because it is bad for you? Do you think the government should ban spray paint because some people inhale it? 2. Taxes The government makes a good deal of money off of tobacco tax. If tobacco is illegal, they would sooner or later find another way to get that money. People would be taxed in other things such as foods, gas, and other necessities. Many people who are not smokers would be angered with having to pay these extra taxes. 3. Criminals If smoking was illegal, that would make everyone who is addicted to nicotine a potential criminal. Many people get sick if they do not have a smoke, so they would go to jail for trying to do something that was legal just a few days ago. The prisons would be filled with smokers! There would also be even more 'drug dealers' who would simply sell tobacco illegally. In the end, there would still be smokers, just illegal ones. 4. More prison cost It would cost the government a lot more funds to house the increased number of prisoners. This would also cost the tax payers millions of more dollars, something that we do not need in today's economy. The government must provide food, health care, Clothing, and rehabilitation costs. In the state of California it cost on average $47,102 a year! Forty five million adults in America smoke. So let's say that half of these people give up the drug (which is very unlikely) and the rest go to jail for a whole year That would cost a shocking $1,036,244,000,000! There is no way that America could even start to pay this. And that is for just one year alone! 5. Mass job loss. Nearly 43,000 people were employed in some aspect of tobacco manufacturing in 1993. It would make thousands of people lose their jobs. Many of these people have families of their own that need to be taken care of. The unemployment rate in America is so high right now that we cannot simply lay off all these people. It would not be the moral or inelegant thing to do. You claim that we should give up smoking because it harms others. Did you know that we are also harmed by the smoke that cars give off? Do we go with the easy choice and ban cars? No, we try to fix it some other way, carpooling, driving less, making more pro-air cars. Same with smoking, if we had to change anything about it why not make a law that says you must smoke in a designated area only. We already have laws about smoking to protect people. You cannot smoke at schools or in hospitals, many people cannot smoke at their own jobs, and it is now illegal to air tobacco commercials on television. There are many things that we could try, but I do not completely see the need. There are plenty of other things that are harming us, and second hand smoke is at the bottom of the list. Smoke going into the air is not as bad as you are making it seem. It is most unlikely that we will pollute the planet that bad with smoke from tobacco.

258,"I'd like to again thank my opponent for not only raising this topic but for providing a position that mirrors what I too had thought to be true in my distant past. I, like my opponent, believed that time was linear because the measurements of time we perceive on earth are linear. He believes that there is a distinction between space AND time. This is indeed not the case and because he's chosen the rebuttal that I was hoping he would, he's already lost this debate. Both my opponent and I are basing our conclusions based on the link he's provided in his opening argument (The universe - <URL>... ...) that is, that we believe in the theory of general and special relativity (as developed by Sir Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins and a myriad of past and present scientists and astrophysicists). Having agreed to these theories up front, we know that space AND time are not separate notions but rather linked, and thus referred to as space-time (again confirmed with my opponents link). This distinction is pinnacle to these theories and, in short, states that there are really four dimensions as follows: 1) Space 2) Matter 3) Velocity 4) Time It also concludes that these four dimensions are interconnected to each other (as stated in my opening position). Since these dimensions are all interrelated, Albert Einstein concluded that as objects approach the speed of light (the speed limit of the universe aside from theoretical particles and the big bang) mass becomes infinite and TIME STOPS (emphasis added...E=MC2). This isn't to say that events within the universe can't continue to take place, as they do all the time in the presence of light speed but, relative to the light, they are absent time. Now, as my opponent pointed out via his link, the big bang event occurred nearly instantly ""brief period (less than 10-32 seconds)"". This time frame is millions (if not trillions) of times faster than the speed of light. Since time is nonexistent at speeds greater than the speed of light, and the big bang (cosmic inflation) happened at speeds greater than the speed of light, than the big bang must have occurred in the absence of time. Time is only really present when an object moves slower than the speed of light. Since the Universe started out at speeds much faster than the speed of light, time must have started sometime after the big bang and relative to the object traveling at less than the speed of light. Since objects lose their velocity at different rates, time starts for those objects at varying points in the universe. This supports my opening comment where I stated that you could indeed formulate a timeline but the timeline would be relative to the object being measured from the time its velocity dips below the speed of light. This complex discussion and topic just touch the surface of the theories of general and special relativity. Although these conclusions may sound like science fiction to those not versed in these theories they are indeed science fact! It's been proven not only mathematically but in function as well. Here is a real life example: GPS satellites are calibrated to account for the differences in time based on their movement through space relative to our movement on earth. Since the satellites are moving faster through space-time, true time is slower and engineers program this time difference into the relays used to send signals back to users on Earth. Without programming for this space-time phenomenon, GPS signals would provide imprecise data to users on Earth. This time differential, factored with empirical mathematical principles proves that times slows with speed to the point of absolute zero at the speed of light and goes to prove my position that the universe formed in the absence of time. Again, these concepts are based in scientific fact. These facts provide clear support that the universe started in the absence of time (because there isn't a distinction between space AND time) and as such, it's not possible that the universe had a definite starting point in time. Based on these proven concepts, I ask that you vote against the absurd notion that my opponent believes is accurate.",1,HghDnsty,"

Con says ""A more fair comparison to our justice system would be if a person comitted a crime, and then the judge went back in time and prevented them from comitting the crime and comitted it himself instead"" So the judge prevented the crime (so it didn't happen), but commits the crime himself (so it did happen). Also what ever happened to Jesus being sinless, in this illustration the judge is guilty because they themselves commit the crime.

271,"I thank Mongeese for his quick response and condense arguments. My own points will be broken into three parts: a defense of my characters' validity, questions about my opponent's plans, and my counter-strategy. CHARACTER VALIDITY My opponent claims two of my characters are useless, as Graviton will not have access to gravitational particles nor Super Skrull to his power amplifying signal. While these team members are tangential to my plans and were never intended to do much, Pro's claims demand a rebuttal. To start, Graviton is not helpless. His molecular structure is infused with the gravitational particles, allowing him to maintain flight regardless of whether they are present in his environment [1, see: History]. In addition, these particles are theorized to exist within Earth's atmosphere [2][3], giving him full access to his abilities. As for Super Skrull, he is similarly empowered. Like most members of his species, Super Skrull possesses initiate shape shifting abilities [4] and he will be able to stay airborne and battle with ease. Also, Rules 6 and 7 state that team members and their equipment will be modeled on canon to be chosen by the Team Leader. As the canon I specified for Super Skrull lists the power amplifying signal as a component of his character, it necessarily exists during this battle. QUESTIONS ON ROUND 1 While on the topic of character traits, I ask Pro to clarify the existence of Blue Eyes White Dragon in this battle. My opponent chose the Yu-Gi-Oh anime as the source for this creature but provided no specific story arc. As such, we must assume he is referring to its standard incarnation. Since it is too late to alter or specify source materials, I am intrigued at how a holographic projection of a trading card poses any threat. I also ask that Pro elaborate on Mewtwo's psychic force field, mind-wiping, and ability to transport others, as I found no evidence of such powers in his provided link. COUNTER-ATTACK My opening salvo involves the unique and underrated Spider-Man villain, Spot. Using his ability to instantly generate and traverse inter-spatial and inter-dimensional portals, Spot will work to systematically eliminate the opposing team. This is due to Rule 2, which states that no portion of a character's body may leave the battlefield or they will be disqualified. As Spot's portals transport any portion of any object that passes through them to another location of his choosing, he need only have an enemy touch a part of their body to a portal for them to be removed from play. The moment the battle begins, Spot generates handfuls of portals surrounding all sides of each enemy. These warp tunnels will all appear only a hair's width away from their bodies, with the other ends appearing equally near to the outer boundaries of the battle arena. As such, the opposing team is effectively trapped until they inevitably move and teleport part of themselves out of bounds. Fortunately, Pro has instructed each member of his team to jump into action immediately out of the gate; Link drinks a potion, Harry casts spells, Mewtwo erects a barrier, Rayquaza rises to meet Graviton, and Blue-Eyes initiates an attack on Magneto. As the portals appear instantly and without warning, the slight (and not so slight) movements of hands, arms, tails, heads, and wings involved in each of these actions is sufficient to disqualify much, if not all, of my opposition. The remainder of my team is also active at this time. Magneto and Super Skrull protect themselves and team mates with magnetic and invisible force fields, respectively. The latter also renders the rest of his team invisible. Graviton and Peter, on the other hand, prepare to use two of their respective abilities (i.e. gravitation control and telekinesis) to move enemies toward the nearest warp tunnel. The moves these characters make at this point depend largely on how Team Pro reacts to our first strike. Of course, for an enemy to avoid an immediate disqualification and force additional actions on my part, they would somehow how to remain completely motionless in midair despite gravity, telekinesis, and their own movements pushing them toward disqualification. The next move belongs to my opponent. REFERENCES 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>...",1,Maikuru,"

As the portals appear instantly and without warning, the slight (and not so slight) movements of hands, arms, tails, heads, and wings involved in each of these actions is sufficient to disqualify much, if not all, of my opposition.   The remainder of my team is also active at this time. Magneto and Super Skrull protect themselves and team mates with magnetic and invisible force fields, respectively. The latter also renders the rest of his team invisible. Graviton and Peter, on the other hand, prepare to use two of their respective abilities (i.e. gravitation control and telekinesis) to move enemies toward the nearest warp tunnel.   The moves these characters make at this point depend largely on how Team Pro reacts to our first strike. Of course, for an enemy to avoid an immediate disqualification and force additional actions on my part, they would somehow how to remain completely motionless in midair despite gravity, telekinesis, and their own movements pushing them toward disqualification.   The next move belongs to my opponent.

275,"1st, i would like to point that the only times you should be lyrical or focused more on your words is when your free-styling or rap battling. When it comes to making a song, focusing on flow and using less words but with powerful quality is better. I'll give an example of a news article comparing lil wayne to Eminem. It says this: ""The career-defining single for each of emcee is Eminem's ""Lose Yourself,"" an ode to the struggle of becoming a rapper, and Lil Wayne's ""Lollipop,"" a song about sex. Both songs are approximately five minutes long, and Em fits about 50 percent more words in his song. Weezy's lyrics are much more repetitive, so Shady is essentially working twice as hard to produce the same effect. This certainly proves Marshall is talented and hard-working. It proves he can spit complicated rhyme patterns. But is that what makes a great song? By accomplishing the same thing (a number 1 single) with half the words, Tunechi proves he has a better grasp of lyricism than the Rap God. While word count seems like a wacky way to compare two lyricists, if we're calling someone the greatest rapper alive, it's an important consideration. Lyrics are words, and, as Twitter has proven time and time again, the less words you use to express a thought, the more appealing it is. Being able to express a concise thought on a subject is the mark of a genius, and doing it melodically is a sign of a musical prodigy -- both of which describe Lil Wayne."" (1) I'll also illustrate with 50 Cent's average lyrics of ""In da club"" <URL>... ""You can find me in the club, bot-tle full of bub (12 syllables) Look ma-mi i got the x if you in-to tak-in drugs (14 syllables) I'm in-to hav-in sex i ain't in-to mak-in love (13 syllables) So come give me a hug if you in-to gett-in rubbed (13 syllables) Notice how the lyrics are simply, but the rhythm and flow in the chorus is what made the song memorable. It was according to Wikipedia (2) recognized for it's ""blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps."" It was ""a spectacular party anthem"" and showed ""50 Cent's ability to twist his words effortlessly"" and notably ""sparse orchestral samples and snaking chorus."" Now just because some rap talks about things you dislike does not mean that it's meaningless. Rap is about spoken poetry, but it's also music and because it's music, style should not be neglected. Tu pac was widely recognized for his influence more than his beats and Eminem for his lyricism. Now if there is a rapper who blends in style with substance and is original, creative, with many more qualities, most people will probably appreciate his/her music qualities.

Plankton's use of the ""Enlargetron"" can aid him in battle. Plankton has invented various items throughout the Spongebob series, and can use him in his aid during this battle. The Enlargetron is a machine Plankton invented that can make anything bigger, shown in the Spongebob video-game ""Creature from the Krusty Krab."" Plankton can then proceed to use the Enlargetron on himself to make him bigger, preventing Spongebob from simply squashing Plankton with his shoe. At the very least, Plankton will be big enough to not be easily squashed. It is possible for Plankton to be big as Spongebob, or even larger. The use of the Enlargetron gives him better defense in the form of size. 2. Plankton can use his ""Hypno-Pod"", shown in the online Spongebob game ""Plankton's Pernicious plot"". The Hypno-Pod, another invention by Plankton, hypnotizes jellyfish into becoming his slaves, giving Plankton control over them. Once gaining control of the Jellyfish, Plankton can simply direct them to attack Spongebob. The Jellyfish can give Spongebob enough of an electrical shock to make his body and heart to suffer a shock, and thus rendering him unconscious. 3. Plankton can use the ""Robo Krabs"" as a good defense and offense against Spongebob. The robot is a fake Mr. Krabs. It is made of a hard metal. Plankton can simply enter this robot whilst fighting Spongebob. Spongebob cannot simply punch, kick, or use his karate skills to break the robot, considering the strength of the robot. The robot has sharp claws that can be used to crush Spongebob's arms, and even his eyes. Plankton is also skilled enough with the robot, to the point where he could perform random acts with it in order to prove he was the real Mr. Krabs to Spongebob, in the Spongebob episode ""Imitation Krabs"".

280,"According to the IRS ""Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset"", and ""Capital assets include a home, household furnishings and stocks and bonds held in a personal account."" (1) Land is capital, a house is capital, a car is capital, a couch is capital, a bed is capital, a computer is capital, a blender is capital, a TV is capital; it's all capital. Investorwords.com defines capital as ""The money, property, and other valuables which collectively represent the wealth of an individual or business."" (2) In other words, if you own 1,000 books, each one of those books is capital, and can be considered material wealth. Since one is capable of selling their book for money, or trading it for some other product of equal value, the books are considered capital, because the books have a value. If someone collects trading cards, their trading cards are also capital with the rarer cards being of greater value, due to the greater demand and lower supply. One could trade a single rare card for 10 common cards, which is no different than exchanging a dollar for 10 dimes. Currency is simply the representation of material capital, to replace bartering with a system of standardized trade. All property has a value, and so all property capital. If it can be bought or sold, or used to generate revenue, than it is capital. Humans are capital because our skills help to generate revenue; a book is capital because it can be sold or rented.

  According to the IRS  “Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset”, and “Capital assets include a home, household furnishings and stocks and bonds held in a personal account.” (1) Land is capital, a house is capital, a car is capital, a couch is capital, a bed is capital, a computer is capital, a blender is capital, a TV is capital; it’s all capital. Investorwords.com defines capital as “The money, property, and other valuables which collectively represent the wealth of an individual or business.” (2) In other words, if you own 1,000 books, each one of those books is capital, and can be considered material wealth. Since one is capable of selling their book for money, or trading it for some other product of equal value, the books are considered capital, because the books have a value. If someone collects trading cards, their trading cards are also capital with the rarer cards being of greater value, due to the greater demand and lower supply. One could trade a single rare card for 10 common cards, which is no different than exchanging a dollar for 10 dimes.  
     
  Currency is simply the representation of material capital, to replace bartering with a system of standardized trade. All property has a value, and so all property capital. If it can be bought or sold, or used to generate revenue, than it is capital. Humans are capital because our skills help to generate revenue; a book is capital because it can be sold or rented. A horse is capital because it can be used for transportational services, in order to generate a profit. A dog can be capital because it can be used for hunting, and may be bought and sold as pets. So long as it has a value, or a usage it can be considered capital.     Sources:  1.   http://www.irs.gov...   2.   http://www.investorwords.com...

First, you stated ""A waiter must take orders, constantly take care of customers, get the food out quickly and correctly, and be nice. All of this deserves a tip, especially when most of their salary is obtained through tips."" What, i ask you, do you think the pizza delivery men and women do? The waiter in a restaurant makes far more money than the average delivery worker even without the tips. If you use the percentage excuse as you stated in your last argument then you will realize that the food sold at a restaurant with waiters costs far more than a simple pizza. Second, to respond to your statement ""Who's to say that the consumer doesn't have a harder job (factory worker, serviceman, etc.) that doesn't get a tip"" it is because the employer has to take into account of the labour by way of the Fed. government.

When looking at this resolution we must look at the [1]National Organ Transplant act or (NOTA). This was a bill passed by congress in 1984 to establish the procedure for organ donation, as well as to encourage organ donation. one major thing entailed by this bill, was the rule explicitly forbidding citizens to sell their organs.

That said, I offer you three independent arguments; if the impacts I present outweigh the impacts of the Pro, the vote must go to the con. Argument 1: The united states' substantial debt and organ donation is costly This point is fairly obvious to any-one here in the U.S. who has paid even the slightest bit of attention to the past six years; we've been in several wars, supported relief funds to various countries such as Haiti, Japan, and Korea; and have been supporting social security to the elderly and disabled. as of [2] April 11th 2011, the US national debt clock reached $14,279,190,561,330.12. Factor in that the U.S. population is roughly 310,367,111 people, and we see that each citizen's share of the debt is $46,007.42. Along with this already substantial debt, [3]organ transplants cost colossal amounts of money; with the cheapest being the kidney at more than $200,000, and the more expensive transplants being the heart-lung, and intestines only transplants at more than $1,000,000. We can't afford to pay the debt we already owe, the government allowing this funding for organ transplant procedures is completely out of the question. We've even gotten to the point of a [4]Government Shutdown due to lack of funding. Now this is obviously a hot button issue, that will not have consensual agreement in congress. If the Republicans and Democrats couldn't even stop bickering over their own agendas long enough to support the needs of the general American population; what chance is there of funding being allotted for an already controversial issue that only affects a small portion of society?

Argument 2: Families can opt out of their loved one's organs being donated [5] ultimately the families of the deceased make the final decision on whether or not they want their loved ones organs to be donated. So even if somebody wanted to be an organ donor, their family can simply say no; thus the government could be out thousands, even millions of dollars for these financial incentives and never even get the organs. Make a direct link between this and my prior argument regarding funding, and we can see that voting Pro in this debate is not a possibility. For a moment, let's say that some-how funding for these financial incentives has been found, in this case we must still refer back to the fact that families can opt out of their loved one's organs being donated; thus we could (and likely will) still have the negative impact of the government paying out these financial incentives and never get the organs. But it goes even deeper than that; let's say that by signing up to become an organ donor who would be receiving these financial incentives, you forfeit your families right to say no to having your organs donated upon your death. In this case the families will suffer and have their rights violated. When a person dies heir body becomes the property of their loved ones, and by taking away this body (i.e. the organs) the right to property is violated. Now in order to fully and completely grasp this idea, we must realize something first; [6] the dead do not have rights.

Argument 3: Donor indicates that the person is not paid The main impact here, is that in the status quo there are already people who willingly choose to be organ donors, not for any kind of financial compensation; but because they see it as a noble cause and want to support it. However when we pay these people for their organs, they are no longer donors; but they are vendors. Organ donation is a noble act, when some-one decides they want to give their most dear and personal possessions; they only thing in this world that is undeniably theirs, for the sake of another, they should be allowed that dignity. However when we allot money for this charity, it is no longer a noble task; but a way to make a quick buck.

291,"Rebuttal to Opening Argument: To begin, I would just like to note that Pro's opening statement is practically a concession. By stating that the resolution is 'Feminism fights to harm men', then saying that you are only arguing against radicalism within the ideology, instead of the ideology itself, it a concession. Also, by only limiting their arguments to the western world, it is again a concession. The resolution is 'Feminism fights to harm men', not 'Radical misandry fights to harm men in the West'. However, I will still continue with my arguments. I. My opponent says that today's society is feminist, when it clearly isn't. The definition of feminism, as provided in my opening argument, is the abolition of patriarchy in favor of gender equality. Even if we were living within a female privileged society, it wouldn't be feminist. Since there is simply a new hierarchy that would've been established (matriarchy) instead of gender equality. II. My opponent bases his first point on an unsourceable event. Saying that you have been the 'victim' of feminists, then speaking about such event isn't a legitimate source. It is completely biased by your view of the event. Even then, these people you speak of aren't exactly the most prominent theorists within feminism. III. My opponent stereotypes that all feminists 'assume that men are predators'. This is a complete association fallacy, just because some feminists have a certain radical quality (misandry) doesn't mean that all feminists have a radical quality (misandry). IV. My opponent did not provide a source to back up point 3. V. There is evidence that shows that the number of women incarcerated has actually increased. The number of incarcerate women has increased fivefold from 2001, partially due to lack of treatment for women who violate laws. Whereas men have more accessability to such treatment.[1][2] VI. Solanas was both mentally insane, and highly criticized by fellow feminists. Solanas suffered physical and sexual abuse from both her father and grandfather[3][4], and would later in life be diagnosed with schizophrenia and be sent to a psychiatric hospital. Betty Friedan, who is noted as writing the famous book, The Feminist Mystique , said that Solanas' views were far too radical and polarizing.[5] VII. The Violence Against Women Act does not imply such by title. The Violence Against Women Act, by title, implies that women have been the main target of domestic violence historically. Women have only started to be seen as actual human beings with feelings rather than just house-keepers since the end of the Victorian Era. Which has been roughly 100 years. Pro also did not provide a source for point 6. VIII. Many of men's problems, such as homicide, are not caused by class struggle within a gender context. The statistics my opponent has mentioned are not directly caused by patriarchy, so why should strict (meaning they only adhere to this one ideology, that being feminism) feminists deal with such an issue? Are some of the numbers involved in those statistics caused by patriarchy, yes. However, saying that they don't care about men because their ideology isn't able to deal with every problem is baseless. However, most of those numbers were caused by different struggles within society, such as poverty. IX. Male rapes are also the result of patriarchy. Male-male rape usually occurs when one male either a) fails to meet the standards that the male gender has set upon them, and are seen as 'weak' and are more likely to be raped, or b) is seen as a means of achieving sexual satisfaction in a place (such as prison) devoid of females (which by many men can be seen as sex objects) and are used as a substitution. Male rape commited by females also occurs due to patriarchy, since males have to meet a standard of 'becoming a man' and are sexually assaulted by women who seek to gain sex out of such under this guise. This itself can actually cause some men to grow up hating women. Many feminist articles have been published in favor of ending male rape and female rape. Even then, it doesn't matter who gets raped more. Feminism is about trying to end patriarchial culture that harms both women and men. What feminists argue for is to stop rape and rape culture in general. X. The last few paragraphs provided by my opponent were just a copy/paste job.[6] Rebuttal to Second Argument: My opponent starts by reposting some of which they already posted in the first argument, please see above for my rebuttals to such. I. A dictionary definition cannot be 'tainted'. The radical feminists you mention are only more 'popular' since media can make more money by creating a story that is completely out of proportion and spread dishonest information than by telling the truth. Ideological definitions don't just 'change', anyone who is a misandrist or believes in feminine supremacy isn't a feminist by the definition I provided, since they obviously don't support gender equality.

292,"I would like to thank my opponent for a great debate. She turned out to be quite the opponent. 1.Popular Vote vs. Equality In order for this to be true my opponent would have needed to substantiate that there was inequality. Heterosexuals and homosexuals have equal rights. Every person has the right to marry one person of the opposite sex. We HAVE equal protection under the law. I am not permitted to have multiple wives, just like a wannabe polygamous is not permitted to have multiple wives. I cannot marry a man, nor can someone who wants to marry a man. I cannot have sex with an animal (at least in my particular province), just like a zoophile cannot. I cannot have sex with children, and neither can a pedophile. This IS the definition of equal. My opponent is comparing gay marriage to African American rights. This is not analogous and therefore irrelevant. Homosexuality is not innate, but research tends to agree that homosexuality is a learned behavior (1). Gay marriage should not be nationally imposed because it would have to circumvent our current legal system in order to do so. 2.Definition of equality My opponent's definition of equality is not a recognized definition of equal and is logically unstable. She insists that we cannot ""deny someone something because they aren't exactly like [me]."" Such a definition insists that we grant all things to all people - as we will find that no two people are alike. Our current marriage laws are equal in terms of rights. Every individual as the exact same right to marry one individual of the opposite sex. 3.Homosexuality is innate So my opponent's presumption is that because she has seen no evidence to the contrary, that the weak and untenable correlation should be presumed as proof? Would my opponent similarly expect, if no evidence to the contrary has yet been displayed, that climate change is the result of a decrease in pirates? I certainly expect not. No current research comes close to supplying evidence to substantiate the claim (2). The source she gave only supplies a weak correlation and does not account for lesbianism. If indeed homosexuality was innate, it is quite strange that there would be ex-homosexuals(3). 4.Children and Animals cannot give consent You are using the law (of contractual consent) to unquestionably condemn some issues (pedophilia and zoophilia), yet you are condemning the law on other issues (its non-allowance of gay marriage). Where is the warrant for age of consent? Children ARE capable of giving consent - and very often do (adoptions for instance). You call my equivocation abhorrent without proving it as such. Male animals can give consent - and many female animals (the female dolphin for instance) will give signals of consent when they are ready to mate (4). 5.Polygamy and Polyandry My opponent suggests that it would be a blatant cheating of the law to allow 3 or 4 consenting individuals, who deeply love one another, to marry. But it is apparently no cheating of the law to completely circumvent our legal system to establish nationally recognized gay marriage. Can we not change tax laws in regards to individuals with multiple spouses - that does not seem too hard. Not allowing polygamy and polyandry spits in the face of my opponent's definition of equality. 6.Education My opponent does not care that schools would be forced to revamp education in order to support a lifestyle that is against the will of the people. My opponent believes that teaching students that a relationship between a man and a woman - a biologically and anatomically attested match - is homophobic propaganda. Now if she was told, a few days from now, that schools have decided to teach and support pedophilia (but they took the stand of affirming that the child must be of at least age 10), would she not rightly be angry? Angry because she feels it to be wrong and because the majority of other people feel it to be wrong, but, in spite of it all, they went along and did it anyway? I would be angry too.

296,"Meyer may wish to digress, but I'm not going to chase that rabbit. This debate is not about his digression. Similarly, Van McGee's argument has been much discussed and shown not to do what Meyer tries to propose for it in this debate. That's for another time and place (my place, perhaps), if there is interest. Meyer's own claim is, in part: > ""not that the argument is invalid in a particular system > of logic where it would be valid..."" That also is a different debate as is Meyer's effort to suggest, only suggest, that there may be some legitimate logical system in which my argument would be considered INvalid. If he finds one, I will be glad to consider it. The exercise is not about quibbling over ""logical systems"" or whether or not my argument is valid in one or all legitimate, real world logical systems. That my argument may be valid, by definition, according to the rules of one or all legitimate, real world logical systems is incidental/coincidental to the issue before us here. Atheists make the affirmative claim, reach the conclusion, that the idea/concept of God was a product of the imaginative powers of the mind of man. I have presented one argument which, if its premises are true, allows the atheist to reach that conclusion. I propose that atheists cannot, successfully, divorce their affirmative claim from my argument and its implications. I don't recall any of my opposition offering any better argument that supports the conclusion, the atheists' affirmation, though many imaginative stories have been offered as to how the idea/concept originated. The discussion is about reason, not logical systems. In affirming ""imagination"" as the conclusion, the atheist implies the belief that man was possessed of such a power so as to have accomplished the feat; the minor premise. Some even are so bold as to affirmatively, explicitly, claim that the minor premise is true. Given that the conclusion is affirmed and that the minor premise is affirmed, we can easily construct the major premise necessary to complete the reasoning that would, if true, support the atheists' conclusion. My argument is constructed in such a manner that if its premises are true, then its conclusion will follow as true therefrom. To save a little time and effort, we have been referring to such a construction as being ""logically valid"". In closing, I will state my opinion as to why so many have fought so hard against simply, successfully completing the exercise; so much so that they have, historically, refused to take the simplest Step #1 and deal openly, honestly with it. My argument fairly and reasonably reflects a fundamental position of atheists. Atheists implicitly and/or explicitly believe one or both premises to be true. It is undisputed that atheists believe the conclusion to be true. Atheists don't like to admit ""believing"" such things. They ""believe"" the premises and conclusion of my argument, implicitly and/or explicitly. Such beliefs go beyond the evidence upon which their beliefs are based, and some have been open and honest enough to admit that such is the case by noting that one or both of the premises are lacking in evidence and may, in fact, not be true. No tricks. No traps. Just the way it is; in my opinion. It's nice to know as one considers the popular public debate over such things. Atheists don't believe there is any ""God"". OK! I get it! Meyer, I thank you for offering what is probably as good as any opposition may have to my claim regarding Step #1 of the exercise. Hopefully, your final submission will allow us to bring the formal discussion, such as it has been, to a reasonable and cordial conclusion.

Folks should be able to find me at my place if they wish to pursue these matters, or maybe there will be some additional banter in the comments section here.",1,RLBaty,"
  
Meyer may wish to digress, but I'm not going to chase that rabbit. This debate is not about his digression.  
  
Similarly, Van McGee's argument has been much discussed and shown not to do what Meyer tries to propose for it in this debate. That's for another time and place (my place, perhaps), if there is interest.  
  
Meyer's own claim is, in part:  
  
> ""not that the argument is invalid in a particular system  
> of logic where it would be valid...""  
  
That also is a different debate as is Meyer's effort to suggest, only suggest, that there may be some legitimate logical system in which my argument would be considered INvalid. If he finds one, I will be glad to consider it.  
  
The exercise is not about quibbling over ""logical systems"" or whether or not my argument is valid in one or all legitimate, real world logical systems. That my argument may be valid, by definition, according to the rules of one or all legitimate, real world logical systems is incidental/coincidental to the issue before us here.  
  
Atheists make the affirmative claim, reach the conclusion, that the idea/concept of God was a product of the imaginative powers of the mind of man.  
  
I have presented one argument which, if its premises are true, allows the atheist to reach that conclusion. I propose that atheists cannot, successfully, divorce their affirmative claim from my argument and its implications.  
  
I don't recall any of my opposition offering any better argument that supports the conclusion, the atheists' affirmation, though many imaginative stories have been offered as to how the idea/concept originated.  
  
The discussion is about reason, not logical systems.  
  
In affirming ""imagination"" as the conclusion, the atheist implies the belief that man was possessed of such a power so as to have accomplished the feat; the minor premise.  
  
Some even are so bold as to affirmatively, explicitly, claim that the minor premise is true.  
  
Given that the conclusion is affirmed and that the minor premise is affirmed, we can easily construct the major premise necessary to complete the reasoning that would, if true, support the atheists' conclusion.  
  
My argument is constructed in such a manner that if its premises are true, then its conclusion will follow as true therefrom. To save a little time and effort, we have been referring to such a construction as being ""logically valid"".  
  
In closing, I will state my opinion as to why so many have fought so hard against simply, successfully completing the exercise; so much so that they have, historically, refused to take the simplest Step #1 and deal openly, honestly with it.  
  
My argument fairly and reasonably reflects a fundamental position of atheists.  
  
Atheists implicitly and/or explicitly believe one or both premises to be true.  
It is undisputed that atheists believe the conclusion to be true.  
  
Atheists don't like to admit ""believing"" such things.  
  
They ""believe"" the premises and conclusion of my argument, implicitly and/or explicitly. Such beliefs go beyond the evidence upon which their beliefs are based, and some have been open and honest enough to admit that such is the case by noting that one or both of the premises are lacking in evidence and may, in fact, not be true.  
  
No tricks.  
No traps.  
Just the way it is; in my opinion.  
  
It's nice to know as one considers the popular public debate over such things.  
  
Atheists don't believe there is any ""God"".  
  
OK!  
I get it!

304,"The old version of debate.org had some flaws that needed to be addressed. One of the primary flaws was that of those who made second, third, or more accounts simply to vote for themselves and to cheat the system. Mobile phone confirmation makes it much more difficult for one to cheat than simple email confirmation. Anybody can get a free email address any time they desire, and in turn create several accounts skewing their own scores, or harming the scores of others. Since not many people have multiple cell phone numbers, and even for those that do the numbers are far more limited than the nearly unlimited use of email accounts, this will clearly limit the amount of fake accounts created. Alternatives for people who do not have cell phones would be to ask their friends for help, as it is unlikely you will have friends with no cell phones at all, and one that will be unable to recieve a single text message to help you. Consequently, this also helps prevent cheating in that people A. Have a finite, limited number of friends who can help them with this, even if they wanted to use them to cheat and B. Friends will get more annoyed the more you ask them, and finding willing friends goes down the more friends you have found that will help you. SO- while the new cell phone program is not something that will necessarily be good for all individuals in this group, as a whole we benefit with much more fair debates.

One of the primary flaws was that of those who made second, third, or more accounts simply to vote for themselves and to cheat the system. Mobile phone confirmation makes it much more difficult for one to cheat than simple email confirmation. Anybody can get a free email address any time they desire, and in turn create several accounts skewing their own scores, or harming the scores of others. Since not many people have multiple cell phone numbers, and even for those that do the numbers are far more limited than the nearly unlimited use of email accounts, this will clearly limit the amount of fake accounts created.  
  
Alternatives for people who do not have cell phones would be to ask their friends for help, as it is unlikely you will have friends with no cell phones at all, and one that will be unable to recieve a single text message to help you.  
  
Consequently, this also helps prevent cheating in that people  
  
A. Have a finite, limited number of friends who can help them with this, even if they wanted to use them to cheat  
  
and  
  
B. Friends will get more annoyed the more you ask them, and finding willing friends goes down the more friends you have found that will help you.  
  
SO- while the new cell phone program is not something that will necessarily be good for all individuals in this group, as a whole we benefit with much more fair debates. For those who are directly affected by this, they may still use alternative methods of activation- namely asking friends and family for help.",Technology,0,Mobile-Phone-Confirmation/1/,37061
305,"You aren't reading my argument clearly- I stated in the part you pasted that it was the protestants and Catholics, commonly accepted as Christian. The topic of this argument is that Mormons are Christian. If they have his name in the title of their church, is it not somewhat of an indication of their belief in him? And I didn't say that anyone denies him. I said they didn't proclaim his divinity as often or as clearly. Most of those differences have to do with the spiritual definition of God, not the personage we're discussing here (though you guys do think they're one and the same.) The one contrast applying to Christ is that he is the same being as God, and that has nothing to do with pretty much everything important that he did. The important things that he taught and did were not dependent on what he did, since either separate or homosousian (you spelled it wrong), he could have saved us from our sins and taught about compassion and whatnot, according to both religions. The definition of Jesus as the Christ is totally dependent on the fact that he atoned for our sins, something that is as much or more the key of the Mormon religion as much as any other. No differing of opinion on his life or being prior to that act is as pivotal or vital to Christianity. For the record, Mormons also believe in the bible, including the New Testament, the real documentation of his life.

it is not moral to force your view upon others when they define a traditional historical ritual upon binding two people under the eyes of god a god who they have defined doesn't approve of lying man with man. so if it is not moral it most definatly shouldnt be legal

As Sieben rightly pointed out in the comments section, it's pretty undeniable that circumcision has vast medical, aesthetic and physical benefits, and that waiting to get a circumcision later in life can be more dangerous, and it's certainly more uncomfortable, inconvenient and painful. Therefore, Pro's argument will essentially be that despite those realities, it's morally preferable to give the individual the choice later on in regard to his own body. However throughout this debate I will demonstrate that parents have both the right and responsibility to make choices for their small children that will undoubtedly impact them, and that circumcision is merely one of these many choices.

318,"Thank you for those well thought out responses and the rebuttals :)First off I would like to make my thoughts stand out, these are: If someone swears, society will see them as going against ethical morals as the contender rightly states but what is it that makes another action turn someone into a ""bad"" person whereas swearing does not? If I see a peron walk round swearing loads, they could be judgd as "" bad"" but I could be emphasising a point and I am judged as a ""good"" person by the people who know me.. Although, if I went to a stranger and swore, they would most likely judge me as a ""bad"" person as that is all they have seen of me. When you give examples of good you give examples of Jesus, the son of God. He may have done bad things when no-one was looking, he may have sworn once or twice, he may have stolen etc....we do not know as only he, and God knows. The same with the Buddha and God etc but I was thinking more of human beings like, for example, Ghandi. He is seen as a good person by society but hang on, he might have punched a sibling as a child, he might have sworn at someone when he was angry, he could have done anything when he was alone...he could be a pedophile, we just dont know. So, my point being, he cannot be purely good, so why do people see him as more good than me or you? That in itself is unfair and quite arrogant and selfish. Kant said that to do good things and feeling happy about it makes the goodwill fall apart from that action. (not quoted) but ""goodwill shines forth like a precious jewel"" he focused on duty etc...that's getting off topic. When you talk about God being omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, that could bring up a debate in itself. Eg. The inconsistent triad. If God was omnipotent and benevolent he would both want to stop evil in the world (benevolent) and have the power to stop it (omnipotent) but it still exists so he must either not want to stop it or not have the power to stop it. And also, could God create a boulder so heavy that He himself could not lift it? This defeats the object of omnipotence as it over throws it, he can create ANYTHING as he is all powerful, but not something that he CANNOT lift as he can lift it, as he is all powerful. ( I do believe in god by the way, just putting forward arguments :) ) Back on topic. All your examples are true and I agree, all those reasons were wrong and bad but what I am trying to say is, Hitler may have done some good things in his life.

He CANNOT have just done bad all his life,meh must have done some good things. The same goes for all your examples.",1,PeterGray,"
  
Thank you for those well thought out responses and the rebuttals :)First off I would like to make my thoughts stand out, these are:  
  
If someone swears, society will see them as going against ethical morals as the contender rightly states but what is it that makes another action turn someone into a ""bad"" person whereas swearing does not? If I see a peron walk round swearing loads, they could be judgd as "" bad"" but I could be emphasising a point and I am judged as a ""good"" person by the people who know me.. Although, if I went to a stranger and swore, they would most likely judge me as a ""bad"" person as that is all they have seen of me.  
  
When you give examples of good you give examples of Jesus, the son of God. He may have done bad things when no-one was looking, he may have sworn once or twice, he may have stolen etc....we do not know as only he, and God knows. The same with the Buddha and God etc but I was thinking more of human beings like, for example, Ghandi. He is seen as a good person by society but hang on, he might have punched a sibling as a child, he might have sworn at someone when he was angry, he could have done anything when he was alone...he could be a pedophile, we just dont know. So, my point being, he cannot be purely good, so why do people see him as more good than me or you? That in itself is unfair and quite arrogant and selfish. Kant said that to do good things and feeling happy about it makes the goodwill fall apart from that action. (not quoted) but ""goodwill shines forth like a precious jewel"" he focused on duty etc...that's getting off topic.  
  
When you talk about God being omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent, that could bring up a debate in itself. Eg. The inconsistent triad. If God was omnipotent and benevolent he would both want to stop evil in the world (benevolent) and have the power to stop it (omnipotent) but it still exists so he must either not want to stop it or not have the power to stop it. And also, could God create a boulder so heavy that He himself could not lift it? This defeats the object of omnipotence as it over throws it, he can create ANYTHING as he is all powerful, but not something that he CANNOT lift as he can lift it, as he is all powerful. ( I do believe in god by the way, just putting forward arguments :) )  
  
Back on topic. All your examples are true and I agree, all those reasons were wrong and bad but what I am trying to say is, Hitler may have done some good things in his life. I can't say what, but I'm sure he was good to Eva Braun, his wife. And I'm sure he will have given a fellow soldier a cigarette in the first world war. He CANNOT have just done bad all his life,meh must have done some good things. The same goes for all your examples.",Philosophy,1,No-one-can-be-purely-good-or-bad/1/,38904

I argue that the Islamic face veil poses problems for integration, because it represents ideas that are diametrically opposed to Western culture. 1. ""Wearing the burqa is an act offensive to Western culture and should therefore not be allowed."" a) It is offensive because it symbolizes male control of women and the total exclusion of women from the public sphere. b) Why do I have to prove Western culture is superior for my argument to work?

We are not debating whether Western culture is superior to other cultures, only whether Western culture is compatible with the Islamic face veil. 2.

Whether Muslim scholars think the face veil is optional is irrelevant to my argument. So what if some scholars think the ""face veil is not even part of the minimum female hijab dress code""? First, this does not indicate that those who wear it wear it by ""free choice."" Second, Con's insistence that the face veil is voluntary obscures the historical purpose, context, and effect of the face veil: patriarchal tyranny over women. 3. ""According to the rationalizations provided by Muslim men, women must wear the burqa because, if they don't, men will rape women who show their face in public."" Quite a few Muslim academics have made this argument: Qasim Amin, Tahrir al-mar'a; Zainab al-Fawwaz, ""Fair and Equal Treatment""; Bahithat al-Badiya, ""Mabadi al-Nisa'I""; Mostafa Hashem Sherif, ""What is Hijab?""; Nawal El Saadawi, ""The Political Challenges Facing Arab Women at the End of the 20 th Century"".

For that, see: Margot Badran's Feminism in Islam , or the works of countless other Western academics, including Judith Tucker, opponents of face veiling. 4. ""Because of veiling, women were not allowed to get an education, nor to have any role in political life. In fact, they were not allowed to have any role at all in public life."" Con states: ""When Muslim women choose the veil, they must also bear in mind there may be certain professions they cannot take because of it, but also there are professions that may suit them perfectly. But this doesn't mean they cannot by any means contribute to society. "" No, according to the history of the veil, it has been a marker of female seclusion. This means women were not allowed to participate in public life. That is the history and meaning of the veil. Con has demonstrated no evidence to contest the history and meaning of the veil as such. 5. ""Con argues that it is the right of woman to wear the veil. Con has provided no evidence that woman have this right."" Con argues: ""What right does he have then to demand evidence from that woman that it is her right to wear what she likes, so long as it's not harming/offending anyone?""

Con's patriarchal arguments are not subtle, trying to conceal themselves under a facade of giving women the right to choose. Women's right to voluntarily wear the face veil doesn't change what the face veil represents nor does it change the fact that the face veil is harmful and offensive. 6. ""The veil clearly represents the patriarchal oppression of women."" Con has not provided any ""Islamic rulings"" that show the veil is not meant for oppressing women. And even if Con were to show such rulings, they would be rulings that completely ignored the purpose, history, and effect that the veil has had in Islamic societies.

You have been relying that much with Harvard's study, but I will make you taste your own medicine! I will show you how your source will turn against you! As a treatment for psychiatric disorders, the risks of marijuana use exceed the benefits, reports the April 2010 issue of the Harvard Mental Health Letter. Regular use of marijuana can lead to addiction and other mental health problems, especially in people who are genetically vulnerable, notes Dr. Michael Miller, editor in chief of the Harvard Mental Health Letter. Addiction. The concentration of THC (the herb's psychoactive component) in marijuana has been increasing in recent years. Addiction specialists are concerned that this increased potency might accelerate development of dependence. Anxiety. At low doses, THC can be sedating. At higher doses, it can induce intense anxiety. Although some people find that marijuana calms them down, the most commonly reported side effects of this substance are intense anxiety and panic attacks. Mood disorders. In people with bipolar disease, marijuana can bring on manic episodes and increase rapid cycling between manic and depressive moods. Several studies also suggest that in some people, regular marijuana use may trigger depression. Psychosis. Marijuana intensifies psychotic symptoms and worsens outcomes in people with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The results of several large observational studies also strongly suggest that using marijuana can increase the risk of developing psychosis, particularly in young people. <URL>...",1,Juris,"

Marijuana does cause dry mouth, impaired motor skills, and red eyes, but however, these effects can be found with alcohol consumption and tobacco consumption.     *Again, the burden of proof has shifted to you, but you failed again to disprove the 2012 study by The National Institute on Drug Abuse. You should not only stated that those effects are found in alcohol consumption and tobacco consumption, but you should have also disprove the study The National Institute on Drug Abuse regarding the effects of marijuana.  ARGUMENTS:  Cannabis can help a person like what you said but it   does not mean that the benefits exceeds the risk  s  .  You have been relying that much with Harvard’s study, but I will make you taste your own medicine! I will show you how your source will turn against you!  As a treatment for psychiatric disorders, the risks of marijuana use exceed the benefits, reports the April 2010 issue of the   Harvard Mental Health Letter.  Regular use of marijuana can lead to addiction and other mental health problems, especially in people who are genetically vulnerable, notes   Dr. Michael Miller, editor in chief of the Harvard Mental Health Letter.  Addiction. The concentration of THC (the herb’s psychoactive component) in marijuana has been increasing in recent years. Addiction specialists are concerned that this increased potency might accelerate development of dependence.  Anxiety. At low doses, THC can be sedating. At higher doses, it can induce intense anxiety. Although some people find that marijuana calms them down, the most commonly reported side effects of this substance are intense anxiety and panic attacks.  Mood disorders. In people with bipolar disease, marijuana can bring on manic episodes and increase rapid cycling between manic and depressive moods. Several studies also suggest that in some people, regular marijuana use may   trigger depression.  Psychosis. Marijuana intensifies psychotic symptoms and worsens outcomes in people with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The results of several large observational studies also strongly suggest that using marijuana can increase the risk of developing psychosis, particularly in young people.  http://www.health.harvard.edu...",Health,1,Does-Cannabis-cause-physical-harm-or-public-endangerment/1/,15011

The Incidental Powers provision simply gives Congress power to introduce such legislation as is necessary for the proper exercise of the powers it expressely has under the Constitution.

My opponent is not correct as to how the Control Substances Act was enacted. The Control Substances Act was enacted pursuant to the International Treaties power (Art 6) ( <URL>... ). The US became a signatory to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and thus it gained the power to prohibit those drugs so as to give effect to the Convention.

I disagree, and believe than gummy bears are better than their work counterparts.  
  
What can you do with gummy worms other than eat them? Not much, and that's pretty boring.  
With gummy bears one could put on a little show. For an example just take a look at my friend's images of a gummy bear reenactment. That's seems like more fun than slurping on a gummy worm.

You can arrange them in such a way that you it seems like they're having a little gummy meeting. (  http://flickr.com...  )  
  
They could be set up to look like they're watching the demise of a fellow gummy bear. (  http://flickr.com...  )  
  
Or even storming your keyboard in a gummy rebellion. Viva la gummy! (  http://flickr.com...  )  
  
You can't do these things with gummy worms, no one has ever made a popular story about worms, but cute bears can be the main characters in many stories.  
  
Gummy bears were also the original gummy creatures. If you try to go to the wikipedia page about gummy worms, you'll get redirected to the page for gummy bears. (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  )

The teacher(from my experience) 90% of the time will go on the bully's side, But the bully watcher sees and hears that the bully student is lying, so the bully watcher can tell the teacher that the bully student is lying.

355,"I am just glad you are still here! My opponent states, ""Although alcohol may be intrenched into western culture, my opponent fails to address that alcoholism can be a serious issue that can tear families apart, result in rapes, drunk driving."" Indeed it is sometimes remarked that were alcohol to be discovered today, it would have been immediately banned, along with hard recreational drugs. However it is an ancient part of my culture and civilisation, my right to drink it is part of civil liberties, my civil liberties are a key part of my culture and civilisation, the act of drinking is a key part of social interaction, so again key part of my culture and my civilisation. The fact that it may be harmful, the question of if I should or not consume it is a separate one. It does not actually have any relation to the resolution. For the same reason I will not bring up the issue of the health benefits of moderate alcoholic consumption nor the terrible human cost of organised crime that will be created by prohibition. Alcohol is part of my civilisation, if/when Muslims reach a majority in Britain it is likely that to be outlawed or restricted.

This is a clear gender imbalance, the two genders are not equal in the law.

Be it war, wife beating, divorce and so on and so forth. It is a much maligned and distorted book. However carefully or thoughtfully written the rules on wife beating are they represent a clear inequality between men and women. Should there be a passage in the koran that states ""Wives as to those husbands on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) arrange with your male kinfolk or a local court to beat them (lightly) ..."" Then we would see gender equality. Until we do so, which is not going to happen as the koran can not be so casually re-written, and given that Islam is increasing in the west we must conclude that Islamic values is a threat to western values, hence western civilisation. My opponent states ""Another claim by my opponent is that there is equality in the west. True equality in the truest sense is impossible. In a truly equal society everybody would be living in the same standards and making the same amount of money."" I believe I made some attempt to qualify this claim of equality in my first round. Quote from round 1 ""Though true equality is impossible due to differences in wealth, ability and personality, western civilisation is based on the assumption of equality in the eyes of the law."" So that is to say, a billionaire tycoon and a homeless junkie have in theory equal rights before a Judge. The issue of money distorts this equality, but equality it is a key aspiration. Islam places Men above women, Muslims above Christians. It is unequal and therefore conflicts with western values. I ask observers not to vote according to whether or not they like Islam, irrespective of their opinion on Islamic values, irrespective of the complex issues of terrorism, but purely on who has made the best argument. In conclusion Can it be assumed that should Muslims become a majority in Britain (or any other liberal western democracy) that the citizens of that country would continue to enjoy gender equality, democracy, freedom of religion and so forth. As no Islamic country enjoys all these rights I must suggest no.

I am just glad you are still here!  
  
My opponent states,  
""Although alcohol may be intrenched into western culture, my opponent fails to address that alcoholism can be a serious issue that can tear families apart, result in rapes, drunk driving.""  
  
Indeed it is sometimes remarked that were alcohol to be discovered today, it would have been immediately banned, along with hard recreational drugs. However it is an ancient part of my culture and civilisation, my right to drink it is part of civil liberties, my civil liberties are a key part of my culture and civilisation, the act of drinking is a key part of social interaction, so again key part of my culture and my civilisation.  
  
The fact that it may be harmful, the question of if I should or not consume it is a separate one. It does not actually have any relation to the resolution. For the same reason I will not bring up the issue of the health benefits of moderate alcoholic consumption nor the terrible human cost of organised crime that will be created by prohibition.  
  
Alcohol is part of my civilisation, if/when Muslims reach a majority in Britain it is likely that to be outlawed or restricted.  
  
On the issue of divorce,  
""While it's often the case that men can more easily divorce it's usually justified. Men traditionally have a higher income so are expected to provide for their wives.""  
  
The Koran does not state that it should be easier for the higher income earner to divorce the lower income earner. It simply states that the man has more rights than the woman. This is a clear gender imbalance, the two genders are not equal in the law. You may find ways to defend this sexual inequality, but nonetheless this does contradict with the western civilisations fundamental desire for gender equality in law.

358,"I thank Pro for his response. Before I begin, I must reject all of this ""10 and below"" talk. Young is defined as ""youthful"" or ""not old"" [1]; Pro clearly hoped to limit his culpability in this debate by reducing the population in question to a ridiculously small subset. That was a pointless exercise anyway, as the definition of role model explains that young people are especially impacted, not exclusively impacted. As such, I am free to discuss Batman's influence on any age range. My Case Gotham's Biggest Criminal Batman commits more crime on a given night than any of the petty crooks he hunts. That doesn't seem possible, but let's do the math. How many laws does Batman break during an investigation? At the very least, there are... Trespassing Breaking and entering Tampering with a crime scene Tampering with and/or theft of evidence Concealing and use of deadly weapons Public endangerment Assault and battery Kidnapping ...not to mention things like destruction of property, stalking, illegal surveillance, evading and resisting arrest, wiretapping, accessing confidential government and medical files, and innumerable violations for the illegal use of his specialized car, plane, motorcycle, and boat within city limits. Believe it or not, that's the petty stuff! He's also committed multiple cases of child endangerment, criminal negligence, attempted murder, and has been involved in multiple deaths. Thus, in his single-minded, violent, self-indulgent crusade to end crime, Batman has instead become its biggest spokesperson. He is the epitome of the ends not justifying the means, and to say that he and his methods should be applauded, even emulated, is hypocrisy. It is also incredibly dangerous, as an endorsement for Batman is an endorsement for vigilantism, violence, and vengeance. Why So Sociopathic? Imagine two orphans. After losing his entire family, the first was taken in by a couple of meager means. His poor upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic, while his compassion for life taught him to value honesty, fairness, and altruism. Despite having lost his home to tragedy and evil, he learned to trust the good in people and would grow up to bring peace and hope to others. The second orphan takes a different path. He also loses everything, but his thoughts festered on revenge and retribution for what he lost. Despite being born of privilege to kind-hearted parents, he learned to see only darkness in others. He later grows up to a world of self-imposed isolation and mistrust, bringing fear and violence to others. Aside from being portraits of Superman and Batman, respectively, these are also snapshots of a stable and unstable mindset. Batman is obsessive, antisocial, sociopathic, and extremely aggressive. He lost any semblance of normalcy and sanity the day his parents died. Now, rather than working through his issues calmly or using philanthropic means to fight crime, he literally lives in a cave, hides behind a mask, and beats up people who make him mad. There are few worse role models for emotional development than Batman. Worst. Babysitter. Ever. Since Pro emphasized children so much in his round, let's talk for a bit about Batman and kids. During his tenure, Batman has employed no less than 6 teens and pre-teens to work as side-kicks and allies, with at least three of which being his own biological or adopted children! You may be wondering why the number is so high when there is usually only one Robin. That's because most of them got messed up...bad [2]: Robin #1: Dick Grayson - Became obsessed with crime fighting; became Nightwing Robin #2: Jason Todd - Beaten with a crowbar by Joker, then killed in an explosion Robin #3: Tim Drake - Watched his father be murdered by super villains Robin #4: Stephanie Brown - Murdered by Black Mask Robin #5: Damian Wayne - Trained assassin; multiple murderer Batgirl #1: Barbara Gordon - Paralyzed by Joker Batgirl #2: Cassandra Cain - Trained assassin; multiple murderer Considering their ages ranged from 10-18 years old when their lives were ended, crippled, or forever changed by Batman's influence, Batman is personally responsible for each of these outcomes. He taught children to fight against murderers and madman and, of course, their lives were destroyed. This sends a very dangerous message to youths and paints a very clear picture about the kind of psychopath we're dealing with here. Counter-Arguments Batman is...a good guy? Pro's entire case can be summarized in one sentence: Batman is a good role model because he fights bad guys and sacrifices himself. Well, remember in The Dark Knight when Joker kills all those mobsters and bank robbers? Does that make him a good guy? How about at the end of the movie, when there are bombs strapped to a ferry full of criminals and one full of civilians. When that tattoo-faced murderer throws the detonator out the window to save the civilians, does that make him a good guy? Pro is confusing doing good with being good. Batman is a criminal who fights other criminals. This does not make him admirable. Batman vs. the Police Batman obviously works outside the law; that is the problem. The ""protocol and regulations"" Pro believes hinder police investigations are not arbitrary. They are in place to prevent reckless, insane, and criminally dangerous vigilantism the likes of which Batman practices on a daily basis. I agree that helping people can be considered an act of good. However, as enforcing and maintaining societal good is the work of the police force and Batman routinely and flippantly interferes with their operations, any independent good he does in the process becomes a double-edged sword.

Blind people wouldn't benefit from learning how to drive a manual transmission car, for instance. In fact, they would be a danger to others on the road."" >>This is a new point in your round 2 thus I have no choice but to answer your claim. As much as I hate new points in my final speech...... We should teach blind people to drive if only so that they may feel just as capable as other individuals. I however agree when you say that they would be a danger to others, thus we will teach them to drive but not allow them to actually do so. Onto the points. 1. You say perhaps it would have been a better idea if my girlfriend had worn a helmet. This is true, however what I am stating is the fact that learning how to drive a manual was just another safety precaution. You also state my phone may have been a better choice, and while I also agree with that, you have conceded the point. That being, driving a manual transmission can save yourself and others if all else fails. =) 2. My second point was avoiding the consequences for speeding. You obviously do not condone such an action as it is breaking the law. However breaking the law in itself is not always a bad thing and there are situation when it is necessary. Such as when someone kidnaps your child and drives away with him. Speeding in such a situation, at the very least to catch such criminals license plate, is necessary. You also state that officers are trained to notice such tricks but this truly does not matter. Unless you can somehow prove to me that a police officer will notice such a trick every single time, even with their special training, then it is still offers a benefit. As proving this would be impossible, it is still a benefit. 3. Here you say, ""This is a myth. Even four-wheel drive vehicles experience slips on icy roads."" I agree, all vehicles will experience some slipping on icy rodes, but this was not my argument. You have straw manned me. My argument quite clearly stated, ""Avoids slipping on ice."" not ""stops slipping on ice"". You also do not attack the crux of this argument being, ""in a manual transmission one can simply down shift to make the wheels spin slightly slower thereby slowing down"" which is where my entire point stems from and thereby my argument still stands in this round. Manual transmissions avoid slipping on ice, and thereby can avoid wrecks. 4. You have me here when you say, ""An automatic Ford Mustang could easily win in a race over a manual Toyota Corolla."" However this still stands as a minor benefit to me as a manual ford mustang would own an automatic ford mustang. I also do not condone racing, that would be a bad idea. I'm just saying in the off chance that one has to race. For instance if my cat was being held hostage and the only way I could get it back was by racing the crazy lady who had stolen it. This would be an acceptable situation to race in. 5. Once again you have me here for the most part. But I can tell you from experience that I look more cool driving a manual. As do select members around the community. I would also contest that such people as dorks and geeks, while still being dork and geeks, are more cool looking for driving a manual than they would for driving an automatic. However since neither of us could prove this point we will consider it moot and just call me cool when I drive a manual. 6. On this point you concede the fact that it can be a bonding experience while stating that it can also be very expensive. Thus I ask our audience and respectable voters. What is more important, relationships with people you love or money? The answer is quite obvious, bonding time is quite a bit more important than money will ever be. Finally you bring up some new points at the end. You say that driving a manual is not necessary however I have already proved how it can be necessary and potentially life threatening to not in at least 3 scenarios above. You the state, ""Also, I don't know how I feel about all physically challenged or mentally challenged people learning to drive manual transmission cars. I think some people are better suited to walking or public transportation."" I agree with you here but must advocate the same as I did for blind people. They should be taught so they might feel capable but never be allowed to drive. Your very final point is as follows, ""It should remain as it is now -- something to learn if one is interested."" And I must thank you for such a point, I would like to redirect everyone to the resolution which quite clearly states, ""Everyone should learn to drive manual transmission cars at some point in life."" This says ""should"" learn, not must learn, or it is imperative. I have brought many reasons why people ""should"" learn to drive a manual but I would not force it as some kind of imperative. My opponent seems to think that I am advocating against free will here. My advocacy however is exactly as my opponent states. It is something to learn if one is interested. There are many reasons one should learn such a thing but it still only something to do if one is interested. Free will ftw! Thanks for the debate Solo.",1,Yraelz,"
  
Alright, I will being my final round by attacking the few atrocious claims you have put forward and then moving on to the 6 points.  
  
""There are benefits for some, but not everyone. Blind people wouldn't benefit from learning how to drive a manual transmission car, for instance. In fact, they would be a danger to others on the road.""  
  
>>This is a new point in your round 2 thus I have no choice but to answer your claim. As much as I hate new points in my final speech...... We should teach blind people to drive if only so that they may feel just as capable as other individuals. I however agree when you say that they would be a danger to others, thus we will teach them to drive but not allow them to actually do so.  
  
Onto the points.  
  
1. You say perhaps it would have been a better idea if my girlfriend had worn a helmet. This is true, however what I am stating is the fact that learning how to drive a manual was just another safety precaution. You also state my phone may have been a better choice, and while I also agree with that, you have conceded the point. That being, driving a manual transmission can save yourself and others if all else fails. =)

I believe the morality behind this ideology is corrupted and misses the true goal and design of justice. But, it goes on, 'it is necessary that society should avenge the victims, that society should punish.' - Neither: To avenge is of the individual, to punish is of God, and Society/law/justice is between the two in the hiearchy. Society's duty is to correct and ameliorate. Not to punish, and not to avenge. You treat crime as a malady, as a sickness. That's the right way to do it. But the sickness, or the cancer as you put it, doesn't reside in the criminal or in the crime he has commited, but instead resides on the origin of the crime, or in other words the motives of the person and what has lead that said person to commit murder, steal etc. Crime has always existed. And it still exists. It's clear that we are dealing with crime the wrong way, focalizing on the crime instead of the source of the crime. Because this is where your analogy goes wrong: research done on medicine, and the scientific breakthroughs achieved in that field aren't to develop new ways to physically extract cancer from the body, they are done to develop ways of eradicating the source of the disease altogther, to make us immune from it, to heal us from it. Sickness has to be treated with care, with attention, and most importantly it must be studied thoroughly, it has to have its source identified, eradicated. Our readers must have noticed by now that I am centering the debate on not the crime or the criminals themselves, but on the source of the said crime, because it is a requirement in order for us to eradicate crime. Just like how you deal with sickness in medicine, you have to go to a prison, and observe the inclination of each prisoner, gather data, understand why person A was lead to murder that innocent civilian, or why person B had to steal from that store. Are criminals actually guilty, or is it that the society itself is guilty? Because yes, society itself bears a part of guilt whenever an innocent civilian has been murdered. Fact is: poverty and misery leads to crime, and to get rid of crime is to get rid of poverty. Poverty is justice denied: this needs to change. (1 & 2). No matter how many people you hang, crime is never going to stop, because the problem lies on society and on government, and not on the individuals themselves. To kill an individual for something he has no power over is senseless, defies the bases of justice, and is straight up barbary!

For example if your girlfriend fell and got a concussion, you would be able to drive her home. (Real life example from me!)

You know that day when you're late for work and you're going 10 mph over the speed limit to get there. Then you see that cop coming down the street at you, now all you have to do is down shift. No incriminating break lights or anything. Good idea! 3. Avoids slipping on ice. Where as an automatic transmission in many instances must apply break in order to slow down, in a manual transmission one can simply down shift to make the wheels spin slightly slower thereby slowing down. This avoids sliding on ice and can prevent wrecks. 4. They are so much more fun. A person who can drive a manual better owns any automatic at race. Manuals can stay in gear for as long as possible thereby revving higher and accelerating faster. Automatics simply flip when they hit so many rpms. This is obnoxious. 5. Everybody looks more cool driving a manual. You know it the moment you get in a car with someone who has one of those nice leather stick shifts they are most definitely a cool person. Manuals are cool to drive, drivers are cool. 6. Learning to drive a manual can be a bonding experience with someone you like. Just have one of your good friends teach you, bonding time, yeah!

Those points being my slippery slope argument, the argument against the family, the argument of separation of state marriages and church marriages. Starting on your points however, economically you have stated that with any economic benefit the government has a duty to peruse this benefit within reason. Here you have nearly the right the economic benefit and the cost for that benefit should go up by percentile, so for a negligible increase in economic benefit only a negligible cost or less can be accepted. The cost of passing this law is not negligible as shown by the controversy and unrest it has caused throughout society so justifying that due to economic benefits is deployable. Also I took another look through your resources to find out where these costs are being cut. And it""s through medical assistance funding. So by giving them their right to marry you also take funded health care in order to justify your economic benefit that is not just. You then question my use of the American deficit and as I stated when in my essay I am not blaming the increase on this law. I am merely putting into perspective these benefits you are basing your arguments off. My opponent then goes on to defend his sources stating, in a rather muddled fashion, that his bias news platform has referenced unbiased studies. However, you are still working off the information presented in a bias fashion so the numbers you are quoting are put there to push a narrative. That cannot stand and thus I have won the economic argument The other argument you brought forward which I refuted and then expanded upon was the idea of an innate characteristic. Now we both agree that being gay is a genetically defined characteristic fine but you say that because it defined like that it makes it 100% likely that they will turn out gay to which I told you that that isn""t biology so there is one flaw in your argument. Here is another, just because something is defined about your character doesn""t mean that you cannot be discriminated against for it I used the example of a psychopath who through his genetics was destined to become a psychopath. This is similar to the Gay argument because like we both agreed Gay people are ""destined"" to become such. So by dismissing my point because it is not ""appropriate"" is deplorable from the person who has been attacking not only my intelligence but using slander to personally attack my grammatical structures, so when voting please take consider this manipulation of the rules. So to finish this point on an imperial standpoint, when considering whether or not something needs to be written in law you must consider the morality and riotousness of what passing, or nullifying, a law will do. In this case more harm than good. Now the matter of the Church having no right to decide the law. Which yes is correct but vice versa the law has no power to supress the beliefs of the church. That is discriminating against a person""s beliefs which is something that I am assuming my opponent will admit is horrid. Under my model with two separate licenses one for the church a marriage under the lord and the other a union under the state this will get rid of all your discrimination arguments and sole the problems both sides of the table have put forward. My opponent then challenged my argument of the reason for marriage quoting the bible and a source that lead me to a Family Life page. Which yes was posted in the comments but I will still honour as I did similarly last round. You state using one specific quote that it claims god""s only purpose for marriage is love but that very website talks all about families and how marriage will grow a family that will grow your faith in the lord. I.E. the point of marriage by your own source is for creating a stable family. Finally, he states the main problem this moot brings forward that changing the law will require a change in position of the church. But it does people generally think of marriage as a thing that is ordained by a priest in a chapel not a slip of paper issues by the state. This is the Equivalence problem we face and why I tried to separate the two terms earlier. But as it stands it will force the church to change its standpoint. So it is plain to see that Gay Marriage should not be legalised as I have stated many times the cost of forcing people to change their beliefs is not outweighed by the economic benefits or the social benefits. instead we should follow a different course of action like I have stated from the beginning that we separate this gay union from marriage to fix the problem while not causing unnecessary social tensions.

384,"Rebuttals 1. ""SAT's give the school systems access to each student's achievement over the years."" Standardized tests are taken on one day out of a year. This day may not be a good judgement of the skills the student has. I, for example, took the Pre-ACT (which is required in my state) after getting a concussion. It is well documented that SATs are not a good judge of a student's skills. A single test score at a young age that shows below average skills may cause a student to be placed in a Special Education program, which are programs that cause a habit cycle that children rarely escape from. This, of course, harms their future. Furthermore, selection based on these programs is racially influenced, as well as influenced by district, breeding disparity. The test scores also can cause a child to be held back a year, which often does not lead to better preformance than the first year in year two. [1] 2. ""SATs are not expensive at all, and only cost $7 per student"". While it may be true that the required tests taken by students are not particularly expensive, the cost of them is often not even worth what the tests will give to the student. There is no evidence that testing actually improves students scores [2] - in fact, in countries like Finland, where standardized tests have been eradicated have had higher test scores [3] than other countries. 3. ""SAT's show how well a teacher is teaching a certain material."" Unfortunately, the idea that a teacher will be judged based off test scores leads to a way of teaching that is detrimental towards the student. Often the teacher teaches to what the child will be tested on, not in the best interest of the student. Of course, this breeds a variety of teaching in the U.S.A. I like to call ""taught to know, not to learn"". [4] 4. ""SAT's are good to practice because you have to pass them to become such professions as a pilot, lawyer, etc.."" While that is true, to get into a program like becoming a pilot, lawyer, doctor, whatever else, you will have graduated from college, which almost always makes it necessary to have taken the SAT (not just a general Standardized Test, to be clear, the one that is taken by juniors out of 2200 points) and/or the ACT, which is good practice. Furthermore, optional Standardized tests would mean that students where practice in Standardized tets would be beneficial could take the tests, but where it wouldn't be (ex., I have a friend who has epilepsy and violently seizes upon taking any SATs from stress - I too am an epileptic, and tend to have seizures, though much less minor, during tests of that kind) they wouldn't have to take it. 5. ""SATs show what level a student is at."" In essence this is just a restatement of #1. 6. ""SATs strengthen test taking skills for young ones."" This too is basically a restatement, but I will still point out that it teaches bad skills, such as completing tests in the time limit, sitting in stressful rooms worrying, being taught that these tests are absolutely imperative to your life (which freaks children out), and being given bad mediums for preparing.

388,"Thanks, Con. It seems my opponent has already argued against and subsequently defeated his own case. ""Despite highly extensive differences, people all have that common ground [credo] ... I advocate a world government which is strong, and prudently federalized, yet gentle, in that any country may opt out of it. If such and such a country does not like the law of the land, they're free to either leave the law or leave the land."" What Con has just described does not at all fit the criteria of a world government. The definition we have established is a single, unified government that everyone in the world is expected to abide by. If people can ""opt out"" of the government, then not everyone is following the same rules of order. Con pointed out that everyone despite their differences wants to establish laws, so by acknowledging that various communities will establish their own laws, he has repeated exactly what I said in the last round. I pointed out that various governments will inevitably form. Con agrees. As such, this dismantles the notion of a single and unified world government. What Con is describing is the peaceful coexistence of multiple governments, with perhaps a unified system of order that overrides (or should override) them all - say like an institution resembling the United Nations. In this organization, many governments are represented. While each country's power and influence over this organization is certainly not equal, it's naive and idealistic to assume that this would be the case in whatever utopia Con proposes. There will inevitably be a particular group who is more powerful or influential, and that will probably be based on wealth (resources) though there may be other factors. Regardless, the point here is that Con hasn't advocated for an actual world government. He's advocated for the allowance of various groups to form their own governments or opt out of the alleged ""world"" government. Con asks what would necessarily make a world government oppressive. If people could ""opt out"" of the government, then of course it wouldn't be oppressive. However, it also wouldn't be a world government! What this sounds like is a variation of anarcho-capitalism -- a system where property rights are acknowledged, but everyone is free to live their life according to their own values/laws within their given territory. Anarcho-capitalism supposes - as my opponent does - the right for people to govern themselves by opting into a system of governance that appeals to their values. On the contrary, a world government would be inherently oppressive because people would have no choice but to follow the singular law of the land. As I said in R2, a government's rules are usually upheld by law enforcement - the police or military. If there was only a singular legitimate authority with a monopoly on force (as a world government implies), then oppression is evident. However that is not what Con proposes. To be sure that my supposition of what qualifies as a world government isn't off base, I'll refer to Wikipedia's definition and my opponent can feel free to challenge it. He can and perhaps should go into more detail about what this government should entail in the next round. After all, saying it should be ""strong yet gentle"" is still completely vague and ambiguous. ""A world government is the notion of a single common political authority for all of humanity. As of 2012 , there is no functioning global international military, executive, legislature, judiciary or constitution with jurisdiction over the entire planet"" [1]. I'm assuming that in advocating a world government, Con supposes that there should be. However Con concludes his last round by suggesting, ""Every country should have a voice, and no country should be forced to participate in a world government."" If a world government is optional, there is room for other governments a.k.a. no world government - no singular authority with world jurisdiction. Con has defeated his own argument; a world government is fundamentally not a good idea. [1] <URL>...",1,Danielle,"

He's advocated for the allowance of various groups to form their own governments or opt out of the alleged ""world"" government.   Con asks what would necessarily make a world government oppressive. If people could ""opt out"" of the government, then of course it wouldn't be oppressive. However, it also wouldn't be a world government! What this sounds like is a variation of anarcho-capitalism -- a system where property rights are acknowledged, but everyone is free to live their life according to their own values/laws within their given territory. Anarcho-capitalism supposes - as my opponent does - the right for people to govern themselves by opting into a system of governance that appeals to their values. On the contrary, a world government would be inherently oppressive because people would have no choice but to follow the singular law of the land. As I said in R2, a government's rules are usually upheld by law enforcement - the police or military. If there was only a singular legitimate authority with a monopoly on force (as a world government implies), then oppression is evident. However that is not what Con proposes.   To be sure that my supposition of what qualifies as a world government isn't off base, I'll refer to Wikipedia's definition and my opponent can feel free to challenge it. He can and perhaps should go into more detail about what this government should entail in the next round. After all, saying it should be ""strong yet gentle"" is still completely vague and ambiguous. ""A world government   is the notion of a single common political   authority for all of humanity.   As of 2012  , there is no functioning global international military, executive, legislature, judiciary or constitution   with jurisdiction over the entire planet"" [1]. I'm assuming that in advocating a world government, Con supposes that there   should   be. However Con concludes his last round by suggesting,   ""Every country should have a voice, and no country should be forced to participate in a world government."" If a world government is optional, there is room for other governments a.k.a. no world government - no singular authority with world jurisdiction.   Con has defeated his own argument; a world government is fundamentally not a good idea.  [1]   http://en.wikipedia.org...",Politics,2,A-World-Government-is-fundamentally-not-a-good-idea./1/,958

""Better"" Definitions Like I said, I view these definitions as somewhat ambiguous and confusing, so I'm going to clarify them: Gnostic pertains to the position of knowledge that the belief or disbelief in a divine being (i.e. God) is true. An agnostic is someone who holds the position that one does not know wether the belief or disbelief in a divine being is true. Theism, on the other hand, is the belief in the existence of a divine being (i.e. God), where as atheism is the disbelief that God exists. Literally, atheism means ""without theism"" so it's the lack of belief in God. As you can see, gonstic/agnostic pertains to the knowledge about the truth of a belief whereas theism/atheism pertains to the belief about the existence of God. One addresses knowledge, the other belief, therefore we can conflate not only atheism and a/gnostisism, but theism and a/gnostisism: Agnostic Gnostic Atheist Agnostic atheist believes that no god exists, but doesn't claim to know that this belief is true. Gnostic atheist believes that no god exists and claims to know that this belief is true. Theist Agnoistic theist believes a god exists, but doesn't claim to know that this belief is true. Gnostic theist believes a god exists and claims to know that this is true. A more detailed explanation of these terms and how they are combined can be found on the iron chariots website: <URL>... If the table below is too complicated to understand, then I present the following venn diagram (from wikipedia <URL>... ): My opponent's statement, that a ""presumption which seems to combine atheism with agnosticism re-defines 'Atheism' to indicate merely the absence of belief in God,"" is therefore refuted. Atheism is, by definition, the absence of belief in God. When the terms gnosticism/agnosticism are used, we can get a more granular understanding about what a person is claiming as their knowledge with respect to a belief. I don't understand what my opponent is trying to say when he suggests that an atheist has to prove if God existed, when the atheist does not believe that a God exists. If the atheist were to prove that God exists, then he/she would probably not be an atheist anymore. Other Arguments At the end of the first round my opponent states: ""Never mind these questions for now, the topic of debate before us is simply the merging of any form of agnosticism (the claim to no knowledge, which therefore demands no justification) with Atheism (the claim to knowledge, which therefore demands justification) immediately downplays Atheism's claim to fit with and actually be agnosticism. To say I simply lack belief in God' is just a biographical statement, no more."" I'm not going to address any of the other claims, since my opponent also suggest we only address the resolution at hand. However, I would address the point of justification and that is simply: atheism is the lack of belief, therefore the only justification that is necessary is based on the lack of evidence to warrant a belief. In other words: the burden of proof is on the person who takes the affirmative position. Conclusion As I have demonstrated, agnosticism pertains to the knowledge about the truth of a belief, whereas atheism pertains to a belief (or lack thereof). Conflating the two is not a redefinition of atheism, but rather a classification of the ""levels"" of knowledge about the lack of belief in a God.

The child doesn't have a choice though, it's not his fault the girl had sex when she was 16. Sex may feel good but it comes with risks, I'm sure people could resist sex for the sake of them and for the sake of the baby. The baby never had a choice but you have the choice of getting the right size condom(condoms are most efficient when you actually try them out and see which size actually fits) or birth control or both. Killing someone without their choice and they haven't even lived outside of the womb yet, is not okay. 3. You can't predict things, you can't predict how the babies life will go. People like Bill Clinton and Marilyn Monroe and other celebrities were either adopted or reached the age of 18 and went out of foster care. Saying the child might have a bad life is not a valid reason. Also pro-life people do care, most of them at least.

1.Heart to heart will help pay your bills depending on your financial situation, the more poor you are the more they'll help. They also offer free housing and the fate of the child.  
  
2. The child doesn't have a choice though, it's not his fault the girl had sex when she was 16. Sex may feel good but it comes with risks, I'm sure people could resist sex for the sake of them and for the sake of the baby. The baby never had a choice but you have the choice of getting the right size condom(condoms are most efficient when you actually try them out and see which size actually fits) or birth control or both. Killing someone without their choice and they haven't even lived outside of the womb yet, is not okay.  
  
3. You can't predict things, you can't predict how the babies life will go. People like Bill Clinton and Marilyn Monroe and other celebrities were either adopted or reached the age of 18 and went out of foster care. Saying the child might have a bad life is not a valid reason. Also pro-life people do care, most of them at least.

Lets get to rap, go n' claim i look like a girl, it's not a proven fact

like how you love to hang with drugs n' hookers when you wastin all that dough (1)  
  
Tell us about how you associate every generic girl with your ex-girlfriend (2)

Cussin' her out, degradin' women, call it ""movin on"", onto the next friend  
Me n' GCL are ascendin' to heaven, ex gave you hell so don't transcend  
  
Talk about when i got maimed by a white dame (3), call me the lame  
I would ignite a flame, inflict pain on you if there was a name to shame  
No one's ever heard of you, before you blow my brain, get some fame  
  
At least i realize that there is no such thing as romantic chivalry  
While you screwed up thinkin' she loved you n' mope in misery

It has no relevance to the resolution and i will explain: 1) Humans don't have free-will 2) God controls all human actions and can still exist Whether or not we have free-will is unimportant, it still doesn't disprove God's existence, but i will address these points anyways. ""Free Will: Many disagree on what free will is, which is fine, but there is agreement on what free is not. If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will."" Like i said, i will use my previous definition. You fail to establish of free-will, but explain what free-will is not. ""P2: Problem Of Free Will(Non-gods): P1)An omniscient god knows the future. P2) An omniscient god can't be wrong. P3) An omniscient god can predict your actions and can't be wrong. P4)An omniscient god knows your actions. C1) You don't have free will."" There is a difference between knowing your future actions and influencing the course of your actions. Hypothetically, lets say that I know your going to get hit by a car tomorrow but do i have to take action and warn you? No, do you have free-will to cross the street not being aware of an incoming car? Yes. Same way with God. God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2-3) knowing that they would sin, but allowing them to choose between good or evil. ""P1) good is whatever god wants P2) Bad is which opposes god. P3)god can't do what he does not want C) God is always good. This proposal of Divine Command Theory renders all morality completely trivial. If there is a tri-omni god, morality is so trivially that it does not exist."" the purpose of the Christian God is to show us as moral beings who can distinguish between right and wrong (Gen. 3:22) how to be more like God himself. ""P1) If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will. P2) An omnipotent god has free will P3) An omniscient god can know his actions with 100% accuracy C1) An omnipotent god can't be omniscient, because omniscience entails no free will, because then god could 100% predict his own actions(which means he also is not omnipotent, because then he can't predict his actions) C2) The only way a tri-omni god can have free will is if he does not have omnipotence or omniscience, thus no longer being tri-omni"" Your arguments seem very confusing. You speak of how we don't have free-will, but then switch back to God's own free-will. Your 1st conclusion is false because it does not follow that an omniscient God has no free-will and i will explain: Omniscience co-exists with omnipotence. In my previous example, if i knew that you were going to get hit by a car tomorrow, that foreknowledge gives me the ability to either prevent that from happening or allowing it. Your argument then breaks down. ""P1) God must always act for the greater good, since he is omnibenevolent. P2) An omnipotent god can act in a way contrary to the greater good C) Omnipotence and Omnibenevolence are incompatabile "" 1) You strayed from the definitions i set and introduced a concept called ""the greater good"" 2) I never said that God can act in contrary to the greater good, i said that all good is subject to God's laws. Let me repeat what i said: ""whatever God considers ""good"" and ""evil"" is subject to his interpretation, not yours. If God sees it best for you to suffer in order to discover the fullest power of good in a world of evil then that is ""good."" All of God's commandments and Jesus are expressions of God's definition of divine goodness, thus we can only know what he considers good or necessary based on these things.

If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will.""  
  
Like i said, i will use my previous definition. You fail to establish of free-will, but explain what free-will is not.  
  
""P2: Problem Of Free Will(Non-gods):  
P1)An omniscient god knows the future.  
P2) An omniscient god can't be wrong.  
P3) An omniscient god can predict your actions and can't be wrong.  
P4)An omniscient god knows your actions.  
C1) You don't have free will.""  
  
There is a difference between knowing your future actions and influencing the course of your actions. Hypothetically, lets say that I know your going to get hit by a car tomorrow but do i have to take action and warn you? No, do you have free-will to cross the street not being aware of an incoming car? Yes. Same way with God. God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden (Gen. 2-3) knowing that they would sin, but allowing them to choose between good or evil.  
  
""P1) good is whatever god wants  
P2) Bad is which opposes god.  
P3)god can't do what he does not want  
C) God is always good.  
  
This proposal of Divine Command Theory renders all morality completely trivial. If there is a tri-omni god, morality is so trivially that it does not exist.""  
  
the purpose of the Christian God is to show us as moral beings who can distinguish between right and wrong (Gen. 3:22) how to be more like God himself.  
  
""P1) If your actions can be predicted with 100% accuracy, then you don't have free will.  
P2) An omnipotent god has free will  
P3) An omniscient god can know his actions with 100% accuracy  
C1) An omnipotent god can't be omniscient, because omniscience entails no free will, because then god could 100% predict his own actions(which means he also is not omnipotent, because then he can't predict his actions)  
C2) The only way a tri-omni god can have free will is if he does not have omnipotence or omniscience, thus no longer being tri-omni""  
  
Your arguments seem very confusing. You speak of how we don't have free-will, but then switch back to God's own free-will. Your 1st conclusion is false because it does not follow that an omniscient God has no free-will and i will explain:  
  
Omniscience co-exists with omnipotence. In my previous example, if i knew that you were going to get hit by a car tomorrow, that foreknowledge gives me the ability to either prevent that from happening or allowing it. Your argument then breaks down.  
  
""P1) God must always act for the greater good, since he is omnibenevolent.  
P2) An omnipotent god can act in a way contrary to the greater good  
C) Omnipotence and Omnibenevolence are incompatabile ""  
  
1) You strayed from the definitions i set and introduced a concept called ""the greater good"" 2) I never said that God can act in contrary to the greater good, i said that all good is subject to God's laws. Let me repeat what i said:  
  
""whatever God considers ""good"" and ""evil"" is subject to his interpretation, not yours. If God sees it best for you to suffer in order to discover the fullest power of good in a world of evil then that is ""good.""  
  
All of God's commandments and Jesus are expressions of God's definition of divine goodness, thus we can only know what he considers good or necessary based on these things.  
  
Conclusion: God exists and is coherent in his omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and omniscience",Religion,2,The-Christian-God-Does-Not-Exist/8/,58362

425,"I will now respond to my opponent. 1st Rebuttal: I was quoting what seemed to be your main points and then refuting them. Yes, this is a common tactic in debate. I also did my best to interpret your arguments in the last round. 2nd and 3rd Rebuttal: Again, I will restate my alternative. If the ones who are priting the software are found guilty, then they will suffer an even harsher blow to their reputation. Many ofthem would lose their jobs. Should no justice be served because of poor justice in the country of which the University is in, then internation trade could be used as a weapon to pressure the justice. Specifically 2nd: Therefore, the best way to ruin the respect of the software pirates is to make ruin their public image in this mattter rather than ban them from this debate. Specifically 3rd: ""The opposition's proposal of firing and fining, would only work in countries that have very little corruption. Not only that, but how does the opposition deal with the perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people? The opposition has no idea how to fix the problem!"" To restate the point above, international infamy decreases the likelihood of a potential student looking into attending that particular university. This alone would apply pressure against corrupt universities. 4th Rebuttal: My proposal of an international embargo was for the countries who refuse to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy. This is not a contradiction becuase it is not group punishment; it is the punishment solely of those responsible. My proposal that a university not be further punished after all of the guilty ones are removed was directed at such governments that do investigate, discourage, and incriminate software pirates. An embargo on those ""perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people"" would peacefully pressure those governments to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy. 5th Rebuttal: Again, you are arguing my point. The resolution of preventing priating universities from attending this debate does not target the pirates and only hurts the best of the student body that would be participating in this debate. 6th Rebuttal: Correct! Both the PRO and CON agree that pirating software is bad and harmful in many ways. This is a neutral argument. The debate is not over whether piracy is bad and has negative effects; it is over whether or not software-pirating universities should be allowed at the Cork debates. 1st clash: ""The United Kingdom has decided to stop all trade, and will begin patrols effective immediately.""

If this piracy movement continues and expands, it could eventually lead to a depression. Therefore, piracy must be stopped. My recap of this debate: 1.

It is even clearer that banning the universites will not discourage piracy, and other methods are more appropriate. For these reasons, you have no choice but to vote CON.",1,wjmelements,"
  
I will now respond to my opponent.  
1st Rebuttal:  
I was quoting what seemed to be your main points and then refuting them. Yes, this is a common tactic in debate. I also did my best to interpret your arguments in the last round.  
  
2nd and 3rd Rebuttal:  
Again, I will restate my alternative. If the ones who are priting the software are found guilty, then they will suffer an even harsher blow to their reputation. Many ofthem would lose their jobs. Should no justice be served because of poor justice in the country of which the University is in, then internation trade could be used as a weapon to pressure the justice.  
  
Specifically 2nd:  
Therefore, the best way to ruin the respect of the software pirates is to make ruin their public image in this mattter rather than ban them from this debate.  
  
Specifically 3rd:  
""The opposition's proposal of firing and fining, would only work in countries that have very little corruption. Not only that, but how does the opposition deal with the perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people? The opposition has no idea how to fix the problem!""  
To restate the point above, international infamy decreases the likelihood of a potential student looking into attending that particular university. This alone would apply pressure against corrupt universities.  
  
4th Rebuttal:  
My proposal of an international embargo was for the countries who refuse to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy. This is not a contradiction becuase it is not group punishment; it is the punishment solely of those responsible. My proposal that a university not be further punished after all of the guilty ones are removed was directed at such governments that do investigate, discourage, and incriminate software pirates. An embargo on those ""perpetrators when they are the ones in a position to ask questions, and fire people"" would peacefully pressure those governments to investigate, discourage, and incriminate piracy.  
  
5th Rebuttal:  
  
Again, you are arguing my point. The resolution of preventing priating universities from attending this debate does not target the pirates and only hurts the best of the student body that would be participating in this debate.  
  
6th Rebuttal:  
Correct! Both the PRO and CON agree that pirating software is bad and harmful in many ways. This is a neutral argument. The debate is not over whether piracy is bad and has negative effects; it is over whether or not software-pirating universities should be allowed at the Cork debates.  
  
1st clash:  
""The United Kingdom has decided to stop all trade, and will begin patrols effective immediately.""  
The embargo proposal was for countries that do not punish piracy. The U. K. does.   http://bigblog.com...  
A country would not stop all trade, just all trade with a select few countries. Also, note that it does work in third world countries as an economic burden: ""Isolating/sanctioning has worked in Libya and North Korea, just to name a few.""  
  
Side note:

""In the government's case, nobody dies or gets hit with a phosphorous grenade; they are just prevented from attending a prestigious event."" Or is it me? What country?  
Back to the debate.  
  
2nd Clash:  
  
a) No one government will go around the world policing everybody. Each country will be responsibe for its own pirates. Those who do not show this responsibitily will be sanctioned against until they do.  
  
b) If there are many other debates, then not being able to go to the Cork one will not effect the decision of any debate club sponsors of whether or not to fund the club. The university just won't go to that one and go on with its merry way. No behavior will be changed.

""The government wants to use isolation as a way to change inappropriate behavior. The government has shown that it works at a global level. The government has also shown that the good of the many out-weighs the suffering of the few.""

Britain promised to open a second front in 1942, yet failed to do so. Then Churchill said he would open a second front in France in 1943, and once again failed to do so. While the Western Allies stood on the sidelines until 11 months before the war ended, the Soviet were killing Germans in the millions on the eastern front.

I am a graduate student that regularly writes 25-30 page papers on these kinds of topics, to summarize it in 40,000 characters would be doing injustice to a complex topic, so I am refraining from doing so."" In a debate, its the arguments that matter, not whether some one is a graduate student who regularly writes papers. In other words your own personal life is not a substitute for a good argument. You made a claim, I made an objection to it, you don't want to defend YOUR claim, that's your problem not mine. Con says ""Your argument that ""Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable"" is based entirely on you refuting substitutionary atonement"" Yes, I elaborate on this in round 1 where I had said......... ""Elaboration on what it means that ""Jesus died for our/your sins"" I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........ 1) Everyone is a sinner 2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness 3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners"" Con says in the previous rounds ""However, I would like to point out that Pro still has not fulfilled his burden of proof in showing that the Penal Substitution Atonement that he is objecting to is actually the way the Bible presents the function of the death of Christ on the Cross."" I ask Con to explain why they think that I need to prove the bible presents penal atonement theory or ANY atonement theory for that matter, in order for me to object to penal atonement. My objections are based on a moral ground and reasoning, not on what the bible says, or the quran, or an episode of the simpsons. Con says ""Was Con able to show these objections ere false and or unwarranted? Yes, Con showed that a system where the guilty are pardoned by the executive officer of the jurisdiction is not rejected out of hand, which is the second part of your argument.

Con says ""Second, you characterize my use of the word Metaphysics incorrectly. You state that it is simply me using a word to allow for contradiction, which is untrue. 8000 Characters is not a lot of space.

In a debate, its the arguments that matter, not whether some one is a graduate student who regularly writes papers. In other words your own personal life is not a substitute for a good argument. You made a claim, I made an objection to it, you don't want to defend YOUR claim, that's your problem not mine.  
  
Con says ""Your argument that ""Jesus Christ dying for our sins is objectionable"" is based entirely on you refuting substitutionary atonement"" Yes, I elaborate on this in round 1 where I had said.........  
  
""Elaboration on what it means that ""Jesus died for our/your sins""  
  
I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........  
1) Everyone is a sinner  
2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness  
3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners""  
  
Con says in the previous rounds ""However, I would like to point out that Pro still has not fulfilled his burden of proof in showing that the Penal Substitution Atonement that he is objecting to is actually the way the Bible presents the function of the death of Christ on the Cross.""  
  
I ask Con to explain why they think that I need to prove the bible presents penal atonement theory or ANY atonement theory for that matter, in order for me to object to penal atonement.  
  
My objections are based on a moral ground and reasoning, not on what the bible says, or the quran, or an episode of the simpsons.  
  
Con says ""Was Con able to show these objections ere false and or unwarranted? Yes, Con showed that a system where the guilty are pardoned by the executive officer of the jurisdiction is not rejected out of hand, which is the second part of your argument.

On Counter-Factuals. A counter-factual, when given in a logical argument may save the validity of the argument, but not the soundness, as a counter-factual is by its very nature a false premise. A counter-factual is a problem because it purports a conclusion to be true based on a premise that is false. The form is not merely ""If X, then Y"" but rather, ""If X, then it WOULD be the case Y."" While not far apart, the two are indeed distinct. Consider: 1. If Nazi Germany had won WWII, the Allies would have lost. 2. If Nazi Germany had won WWII, Hitler would not have committed suicide. The two are distinct in that the first conclusion is a function of the premise. It's basically the following argument: (N v A) - this is an exclusive or...

Consider: Some unicorns are gray unicorns. All gray unicorns have mud on them. (Suppose too, that only gray unicorns have mud on them... keep it simple). Therefore, some unicorns have mud on them. Since no unicorns exist, the first premise is false, the logical implication being (by contradiction) that no unicorns are gray unicorns. If this is the case, then the statement that all gray unicorns have mud on them makes no sense because there ARE no gray unicorns. On top of that, the conclusion is false, because there are no gray unicorns that can have mud on them. Thus, to consider the argument, it introduces a counter-factual: If there were unicorns, some would be gray unicorns. All gray unicorns have mud on them.

Therefore, there is no need for a high school to offer more languages. I rest my case. ",Education,1,More-Foreign-Languages-should-be-taught-offered-in-High-Schools/2/,37487

Also it gives white people a unfair advantage into getting into college. For example, this is a white Student that tries very hard in school and gets A's and B's every year and their a Latino student who does okay in school and gets C's and some B's.

Even though though people do have to go through that, the point is that you are still expecting me to be okay with killing an innocent life 2.Like I stated earlier there is a risk but not a high one. I also stated there wouldn't be any risks if both partners just decide to not have sex in the first place. If you want to have sex do it for a child and if you're not be aware of the risks, but that doesn't mean that if the condom broke that someone else should suffer because of it. You're killing the baby primarily for yourself and that's a selfish act. Also if someone was impregnated with a condom and birth control, how long ago was this? She could have not taken it in a while, he could have had the wrong size condom or both or she lied for attention. 3. You just said we kill animals for food and our convince, a lot similar to abortion huh? Also comparing humans with animals is not correct. That's why there is a law that makes it possible for farmers to kill animals and for humans to kill other humans. 4. Again that's $300,000 dollars over 18 years, that's a long time. Also if you don't want the kid put them up for adoption. It is true adoption is more expensive than abortion but not by much. Ranging for $200-$1000 5. Read point number 4 6. Well if the mother has cancer or any other diseases she shouldn't have sex and should know the risks it comes with. Also the chance of dying while giving birth is less than 1% in america, specially if the mother has matured. 7. I was waiting for you to bring up that point, about 0.3%-0.6% of abortions are because of rape. That is less than 1%. Are you willing to add a law that calls for the murder of babies because less than 1% were raped. Obviously I'm not blaming the ones who got raped, of course not, but they should consider adoption. If they're life is in danger and she might die from giving birth, then I guess in extreme cases like these abortion should be an option. In a situation like this either the mother or the baby will end up dying, and I'm sure you'll agree with me it is more important to save the mother, but remember my point, less 1% of abortions are because of rape and less 1% of births end up in a death. Responses to your extra arguments 1. Actually no, the fetus can feel pain as early as 8 weeks and if younger(most abortions happen with a suctions that rips the baby to pieces) the fetus will sense the suction and danger and will move around attempting to escape. 2. Read the end of point 7 3.Not an abortion issue but I'll discuss it. Rape is bad, period, and I think we need to make everyone know that they're never at fault and should always tell, but if they don't tell, how are we to know. Also, I personally think in most cases of rape, the rapist should be given the death penalty, this will probably lower rape numbers, probably I'm no expert. Again if an eleven year old girl was raped AND got pregnant (not very likely) I do believe abortion should be an option if her life is in danger. If adoption is possible and there is no financial or medical issues then I think she should take that route. 4.Not much to say here 5. You're right that number is closer to 50%-60% kids get adopted, but as I stated that doesn't mean there life will turn out bad. 6. No one is forcing them, put them up for adoption. Also it is not THEIR body, I thought I said that. Your body doesn't have different DNA and a different blood type. Also the mothers immune system might react to the different blood type, your immune system doesn't react against YOUR body, does it? 7. I've already countered this point Also I know someone will say,""Oh it's just a clump of cells, it's not alive"" According to NASA there is life on mars. You know what's on mars? A couple of bacteria and micro-organisms. If that's considered life, then why isn't a human fetus?

Therefore my definition of government (the political direction and control exercised over the actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities, societies, and states) better addresses the resolution. My opponent responds to my attack on his first contention by saying that by limiting the debate to the US the US law is at hand. There are two problems with this: 1) The debate should not be limited to the US (as explained above) 2) The resolution asks us if vigilantism is justified when the government fails to enforce the law. Essentially this means that no law is existing because a law not enforced is a law that is virtually nonexistent. So the US or international law becomes void. My opponent responds to my attack on his third contention by claiming that the death penalty would occur only when there was no doubt that the offender was guilty. However wrongful convictions can and will occur in the ""imperfect democracy"" that my opponent wants, so people can be convicted wrongly. He then addresses the founding fathers. I never claimed that the founding fathers were vigilantes; I said that the colonists were vigilantes. Furthermore he claims that ""vigilantes avenge unpunished crimes, not unchecked criminal regimes."" However the crime was committed BY the regime BECAUSE they did not enforce the law. So basically they avenge criminal regimes. My opponent then responds to my attack on his fifth contention by saying that we have the duty from protecting that person by subduing them and holding them. However what happens if the rapist (or murderer, etc.) has a weapon? Holding them down won't do much good: they would simply use said weapon. He then claims that my second contention is untopical through his definition of government. As discussed above my definition of government is better since it addresses the entire world as opposed to a single country. Thus you can drop his attack on my second contention. My opponent then attacks my value criterion, citing that it eventually comes down to who decides to what is justice. But, isn't that what happens present-day in the courts: the judge ultimately decides if the offender is guilty? And who votes these judges in? The people. So, essentially, the people shave the right to decide what is justice in either case, which is exactly what vigilantism is. He then supports his VC by claiming that we are protecting the rights of everyone. Really? Is that even happening now? Previously, my opponent claimed that these rights included cruel and unusual punishment. Isn't that happening now, in many cases throughout the world (Guantanamo, etc.)?

People took a claim, which was accepted by many, and considered it true, without strong evidence. They used false positive evidence to 'prove' the existence of God.

This is important to acknowledge WHY our system of science today is so meticulous to ensure there are no biases ; only facts.

""Is run by"" = ""Is owned by"" My opponent shapes this entire resolution around the premise that Freemasons run MTV. This is essentially Pro saying that MTV is owned and operated by Freemasons. In reality, MTV is owned and run by Viacom, which is an American global mass media company with interests primarily in cinema and cable television. [1] So who owns Viacom?

Furthermore, Pro doesn't even provide evidence for this claim, he merely shares an image showing the inside of a Masonic Lodge.

It's the same picture of the inside of a Masonic Lodge. Pro needs to show how similarities between the MTV Video Music Awards and the Masonic floor pattern are connected. Merely having the same pattern or design does not prove anything. If I live in a house with Mediterranean tiles as my floor pattern, does that mean I'm Mediterranean? Absolutely not. In closing, Pro has provided zero evidence for a link between MTV and Freemasons running it. He has merely relied on conspiracy-influenced images which don't even show a comparison or connection. Furthermore, I've not only provided a counter-argument showing who really runs MTV, but I've also provided rebuttals for each argument raised by Pro. I now return the floor to Pro, thank you.

This is not actually an exaggeration (1) because research shows that, on average, most women spend nearly one year trying to decide what to wear. If parents help children decide what to wear, then the parents will also be wasting their time, and uniforms will benefit both parents and children. ""...Clothes can often be used to define social statuses..."" You agree that North Face can make you seem richer than others, and it is sometimes true that people wear different clothes to school (2).

"" I already explained that while an event can be possible mathematically (in that it has a probability) it can also be unlikely enough to be removed as a possibility. If your chances of EVER hitting a dartboard were that low, there would be no point in even trying. You would never hit it, period. So Con's analogy does accomplish nothing. Occam's razor tells us that we should not add an assumption to our theory if it does not explain the evidence any bettter. As Isaac Newton said, "" We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances."" (1) Now, that would mean we should not add a componant that would require something practically impossible to happen to our theory of history. Abiogenesis is not a sufficient explanation, as it is practically impossible. Records aside, if our view of history requires something impossible to happen, it is probably wrong. For example, if my theory required Columbus to completely miss both North and South America (not an easy feat) and then sail to China with only half the supplies he actually needed, it would probably be wrong. Why? Well, the chances of Columbus doing that are practically impossible, especially given his mutinous crew. Occam's razor tells us that the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions or the simplest explanation should be (in general) preferred. The Christian view that God created life requires fewer assumptions than the evolutionary view that life spontaneously generated, a view that was disproven centuries ago and would require something impossible to happen. Believing in a Creator requires fewer leaps of the imagination than believing nature beat the (impossibly high) odds. But evolutionists prefer abiogenesis simply because it avoids God. Probability is not meaningless in the past. It is quite meaningful when we try to recreate a portion of the past that we are ensure of. We can conclude, based on probability, that some things definitely never happened (like abiogenesis). And, as I pointed out, if our view of history requires something impossible to happen, it is probably wrong . The reason evolutionists believe in the abiogenesis hypothesis is because excluding God, it's their only hope of explaining our life-filled world. Unfortunately, abiogenesis is, practically, impossible, which means that abiogenesis should remain a hypothesis and a failed one at that. Going back to the particular raindrop . . . IF the odds for a particular raindrop to hit your nose were that high, then that particular raindrop would not hit your nose. That would be impossible. It would be similar to picking one grain of sand off the beach and then coming back a year later and picking that same grain. So, how come a raindrop can hit my nose? Well, it is my turn to destroy Pro's argument with a probability example. Suppose the odds of picking up a particular grain of sand are 1:30,000,000,000. It would seem impossible that I could pick a grain of sand, right? And yet, I am able to pick a particular grain of sand, despite the odds. Do you catch the fallacy here? If I reach down on the beach, the odds that I will pick A grain of sand are 1:1. The same with the raindrops. If you stand in the rain for 5 minutes, the odds that A raindrop will hit your nose are 1:1. If you were looking for a particular raindrop to hit you, and the odds were as high as Pro calculated (I personally do not think they are accurate) then THAT PARTICULAR raindrop would never hit you. Reason: it would be statistically impossible. Nice try, Pro, but you accomplish nothing. "" You falsely assume in your final example that scientists are uninformed about the topic under discussion and research.

PowerPoint is much better from a utilitarian point of view. There is much more in this program that requires more than your basic knowledge of the software. PowerPoint is quite easy to use, all you really do is put information and pictures on slides and hit F5 for a full-screen presentation, simple.

I am currently using Vista and the only pop-ups from my OS are ones that require my authorization when starting a few programs. I would like my opponent to cite these so called work interrupting pop-ups so I can effectively refute this point. Simply saying these pop-ups exist is not enough to make a point in a debate.

478,"Premise One Con states that objective moral values would exist even if it conscious creatures did not. This is true, as objective moral values are independent of human (or any conscious beings) opinion. Two and two would always equal four whether there is anyone to prove it. Con's statement, though true, is a red herring. We are not debating the existence of objective moral values if no conscious entities exist. We are debating the meaning and usefulness of objective moral values, or moraly at all, absent of any conscious entity. My justification of Premise One in R3 states ' If every conscious creature were to vanish, then morality would become meaningless. ' I never said that it wouldn't exist, just that it would lack any meaning. This claim is obvious, as nobody would argue that a nebulae is concerned with the euthyphro dillehma. The justification one can provide for why cutting down trees does not have to relate to human flourishing. Con states that the reasoning has nothing to do with human flourishing, but this in not relevant. In order for Premise One to be true, it must be reducable to the well-being of conscious creatures, not necessarily human flourishing. Con changed the terms of my argument. It does not matter if the person does not expressively state a reason that relates to well-being. My premise states that it has to be reducible to well-being. That is, we can reduce that moral claim to something relating to well-being. It does not mean that the person has to say something relating to well-being. If a person argued we should preserve the earth just for the sake of preserving the earth, then it is reducible to well-being, even if they do not say so. As I pointed out, preserving the earth relates to the well-being of conscious creatures. Thus, preserving the earth is reducible to well-being, and Premise One remains true. Con misunderstands me. I have not argued that we have to come to all conclusions about moral questions scientifically. I don't, for instance, think that I will consult a scientist on whether I should buy my daughter a tropical fish for her birthday. I am only arguing that the seperation between morality and science is not valid. Premise Two The fact/value distinction is not logical. Values are morals, and morals are just a type of fact about the way things should be. Con and I both believe in objective moral values, so we both believe that there are objective rights and wrongs. These right and wrong statements are just facts about what is right and wrong. From this, I believe that the distinction between facts and values is like trying to make a distinction between A and A, or blue and blue. Premise Three I should clarify the metaphor to make this debate easier, since the point I needed to make with it has already been made. Healthy food is a representation of the myriad of action and ideas that improve the well-being of conscious creatures. Poison is a representation of all the actions and ideas that can harm the well-being of conscious creatures. If improving (or maximizing) well-being is moral, then science can not only inform moral decisions, but tell us what is moral. I believe that is a logical result of ackwnowledging well-being as the basis of morality. We have many cases where science can do more than inform moral decisions, but make them. Of course, as I have said, I do not believe that science can decide every moral question. Otherwise, the resolution would state 'Science determines human values'. It does not state this. There are moral questions that we can only answer purely through philosophical, rather than scientific, reasoning. An admission of this fact does not negate the resolution. Possible Round 5 Suggestion I believe that R5 could be made far more interesting if we simply answer questions. I propose that in R4, we both ask each other three questions that will be answered in R5 of the debate. R5 will be devoted entirely to answering those questions. If Con does not wish to accept, then we will continue on with a five-round debate. If he wishes to accept, then I ask him to make his questions in R4. 1: You are recognized as a defender of Christianity on debate.org. In your view, what is the role of god in objective moral value? 2: Are there any methods of ethical naturalism that you would accept? 3: If you were to stop believing in god, would you become a moral relativist, or some form of moral nihilist?

But, how can he conclude that the education system of NSW is not too hard for those with an ""easier"" education system? Pro thinks that the education system of NSW isn't too hard.

  Thank you pro for taking part in this debate.  
  Quoting:  
  “  My resolution is as follows which i am changing or the last time  - Australia should have a national education system which would be equivalent to the current NSW education system  ”  
  With this, pro has admitted to changing the resolution for the topic of the debate (in the very last round!). He therefore implies that the resolution that I followed was correct the entire time and that HE was the one mistaken.   
  “  I have chosen The NSW education system because it is harder than all the other Australian education systems but not too hard as i would like the students to cope to a harder education in minimum possible time  ”  
  Pro is putting for a VERY BIASED   unsupported opinion  . He thinks that that any education system other than the NSW’s education system is too hard. But, how can he conclude that the education system of NSW is not too hard for those with an “easier” education system?   
  Pro thinks that the education system of NSW isn’t too hard. Why wouldn’t the education system of South Korea not be too hard for the Australian system? [1] I think it is possible for the students of Australia to imitate the students of South Korea. If the Korean students are able to cope, there is nothing to say that we Australian students can’t follow. The only barrier that stops us is the TIME TO ADAPT.   
  “  Profit  - As Australia has one education system then there would not be a point for one education system per state  - The people that lose their job will be trained to the new system and then will replace the old teachers  ”

  “  My case has boiled down to 3 main points  If the current education system stays  - Gifted and Talented Students from other states will suffer  - HSC students will suffer  - Students from all states except NSW students will suffer  ”  
  Response:   
  
  Pro’s claim about the GAT from other states suffering is a biased opinion with no logical reason. Pro doesn’t seem to grasp what GAT means. If someone is “Gifted”, as well as “Talented”, clearly they will easily cope with a new education system that is “harder” and will soon be GAT within that education system.

  “  My opponent has started his debate with a contradicting resolution which supports both sides. I have proven that in round 4 and Con has not rebutted against that claim meaning he agrees.  ”  
  I’m sorry Pro, but when I put forth my resolution as “  The Australian education should remain the   same”.   I was saying that the education should not be changed.  Thus, the same applies with “  The Australian education should remain the same and have a variety of styles with education  ”. Pro doesn’t seem to grasp my idea. The education should not be changed, meaning there will still be a variety of education within the nation. This means the education system should not be the same as NSW.   
  “  Con's Argument has boiled down to 2 main points  ”   
  My argument has boiled down to 2 main points? It is still following one resolution!   
     
  Conclusion:   
  The education within the whole of Australia should remain the same, meaning the education should not be changed.

482,"Thanks to my opponent. My opponent has cited a comment to an article as proof that the editor in chief resigned from the journal due to the fact that she was not critical of the manuscript been published, but that her career was put in jeopardy. Firstly, this is not true she is a highly regards chemist and a list of her achievements can be easily seen, she resigned because the manuscript should never have been published as I have pointed out in the first round.(1) Secondly my opponent asserts this comment as proof, yet the person who wrote the comment states that "" Rather, she said that she could not read and evaluate it, because, she claimed, it lies outside the areas of her expertise. "" This is a bold faced lie, as Professor Pileni is very well published in the nano material field, and like I said is a well respected chemist.(2, 3) This comment needs to be corroborated by a statement from Professor Pileni from a reputable source and not some comment attached to a news story. Comments are not news, they are personal opinions. I would ask that my opponent does not use dishonest sources to promote his claim when the evidence runs counter to this. My opponent criticizes me for, wondering about the chain of custody. Yet to not admit that non scientists were involved in the chain of custody is a dishonest statement. This means immediately that the chain of custody should be questioned as they were non scientists with no formal training in sample handling. However, let the chain of custody not detract from the dropped point that the authors made no attempt to verify the material came from the WTC using chemical signatures. Hence, my opponent drops the critical point that we cannot be certain that the samples come from the WTC. Next I would like to discuss the following new contentions. The presence of the Thermite in the WTC according to the authors is thought to be normal thermite composition. This means it has 2 part Aluminum to 1 part Iron Oxide, and importantly they have to be intimately mixed.(4,5) If these materials are not intimately mixed the do not work, so why then are there two layers in the sample? See the reaction below for the thermite reaction. Fe 2 O 3 + 2 Al - 2 Fe + Al 2 O 3 From this reaction, we can learn about the composition of the material, however in the EDX spectra in Figure 7 there are two points of contention. 1) Why are the aluminum and Iron peaks not the same intensity as they should be? and 2) Why does the spectrum look exactly like and EDX spectrum of iron oxide commonly found in nature.(6,7) From contention 2, we can say that this material could come from any natural source and does not have to be manufactured thermite. From contention 1, we can say that this is not thermite as the chemical composition is not accurate. So how are we sure that this is thermite when it could come from another source. The correct thing to do would have been to use a more reliable analysis like elemental analysis and not EDX. Why did the authors not do this? The data as currently shown is not proof of thermite as the compositions are not correct and could be any commonly found iron oxide. Lastly, why are Figure 14 and 7 different if they are from the same sample? The authors did not say they were removing signals for clarity, so this is a dubious result. This casts huge doubt on the validity of the manuscript, as all the spectra in figure 7 are the same, yet in figure 14 the spectra from the same samples has changed. Note the inaccuracies in C, O, S, Ca and Zn content.(8) Over to my opponent. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>... (3) <URL>... (4) <URL>... (5) <URL>... (6) <URL>... (7) <URL>...

He says that Cato accepted Big Tobacco donations "" and in turn jumping on the Big Tobacco bandwagon."" The earliest instance Pro cites of donations to Cato from ""Big Tobacco"" like donors was in 1991. However, Cato from its inception (in 1974, 17 years before the first donation in question) has been an opponent of government action to curb non-aggressive individual activities. Things like smoking bans and corporate regulation are something Cato has always been opposed to, which would naturally put them somewhat in line with the interest of tobacco corporations. Pro needs to establish that Cato's content was posterior to the various donations and has failed to do so thus far. 2) On Pro's examples, he fails to show that the content must be biased. For instance, Pro says Cato ""has challenged credible science that links second hand smoke exposure to death and disease and has organized opposition to smoke-free environments."" On the first claim, Pro doesn't offer any substantive evidence to back the claim up. On the second claim, opposing ""smoke-free environments"" is incredibly vague. Is he referring to private residences and properties or is he referring to public places? The former is basic private propertarian ideology, something Cato supported before the 90's. The latter also needs backing up by Pro since he also failed to provide evidence supporting it. 3) Pro's claim attempting to link the Cato Institute's opposition to the FDA is also misleading. Since the FDA's main function is to regulate the output of private industry and Cato from its inception has been a predominantly free market thing tank, it's natural that Cato would be opposed to it. Therefore Pro simply saying Cato has spent money writing against the FDA fails to prove anything. C2: Cato and Climate Change 1) First, Pro's only claim is that Cato holds to a certain position without actually even attempting to show why it should discredit Cato. Let's go out on a limb and say Cato (as a monolithic entity I suppose) wholesale denies climate change (not just certain aspects or the prospect of government intervention). Why should this wholly discredit the organization? Cato isn't just a scientific institution. It also deals with topics dealing with a large range of policy issues. Let's say Cato is wrong on climate change. That still doesn't fulfill the rather large burden of proof Pro has assumed in attempting to discredit the entire organization. 2) Pro has also been incredibly ambiguous on Cato's actual policy in regards to global climate change. He alludes several times to Cato's opposition to various State actions attempting to mitigate climate change but never actually mentions across the board beliefs of Cato scholars and writers.
