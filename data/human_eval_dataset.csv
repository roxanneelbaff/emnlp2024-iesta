With food you can get a full hunger bar which will constantly regenerate your health so even if you are taking damage if you manage to escape the fight your health with go all the way back up. With food you can guarantee yourself a way to constantly be regaining health so that you can survive almost every single situation. Gaining enough food to survive for your first night will also only take a small amount of time if you have animals nearby and then the rest of your first day you could build your shelter without the worry of starving throughout the night. Even with a full arsenal of weapons you could manage to drop down to one heart and having no food to heal it you would die your next blow, or from a medium fall.";"Even in a vast desert environment, it is still possible to find ways to sustain oneself and regain health. With a full hunger bar, food can provide a constant source of regeneration, allowing one to survive even in the face of damage. By managing to gather enough food, one can ensure a steady supply of health restoration, making it possible to withstand even the most challenging situations. For example, a small amount of time spent gathering food near animals can provide a significant advantage for the remainder of the first day, allowing for the construction of a shelter without the added stress of hunger. Furthermore, even with a full arsenal of weapons, a single heart can prove insufficient in the face of adversity, highlighting the importance of proper resource management.
I hope this paraphrased argument meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions.";Even in the harshest of environments, such as a 'mega desert,' the availability of wood may be scarce. However, the importance of food cannot be overstated. By consuming food, one can replenish their hunger bar, which in turn continuously regenerates their health. This means that even if someone sustains damage during a fight, they have the opportunity to escape and fully recover their health. Having an adequate food supply ensures a constant means of regaining health, enabling survival in almost any situation. Acquiring enough food to last through the first night can be achieved relatively quickly, especially if there are nearby animals. This allows individuals to focus on building their shelter without the worry of starving during the night. Even with a formidable arsenal of weapons, a lack of food can prove fatal. Without the means to heal, even a minor blow or a moderate fall can result in death.;liberal

5;so you're no longer asking for positions of him, as you orgininally did. experience is important, but well defined posistions are better. not that his are well defined enough but, just pointing out that substance is better than experience. you should be focusing on that instead. he graduated in international relations, which is vital today, then worked at a business organization regarding that topic. he then became a community organizer for the disenfranchised. he then became editor of harvard law review and graduated at the top of his class... which is more than just any law school's editor and class but harvard. he then practiced civil rights law. he taught constutional law at university of chicago, one of the most prestiguous school in the country. he was a state legislator for many years. he then became a US senator for a few years. he seems pretty qualified to me. just because he's not be around as long doesn't mean he can't be president. voting for someone because they're old is not an argument. hte constituion allows president at 35, he's 46... if anyone were to be elected at his age, you couldn't get a better qualifed president. the only conclusion you could possibly come to is that you're going to vote based on number of years only... in which case mccain automatically wins. he's got quality years, not quantity.;"The original argument focuses on the candidate's qualifications and experience, but it is flawed in several ways. Firstly, the argument that experience is important but well-defined positions are better is not a convincing point. The candidate's experience in various fields, including international relations, community organizing, and constitutional law, demonstrates a diverse range of skills and knowledge that are essential for a president.
Furthermore, the argument that the candidate is not around as long as some other candidates does not necessarily disqualify them from running for president. The Constitution sets the minimum age requirement for the presidency at 35, and the candidate is 46 years old, which is well within the constitutional limit. Therefore, the argument that the candidate is too young to be president is unfounded.
Moreover, the argument that voting for someone based on their age is not an argument is correct. The candidate's qualifications, experience, and leadership abilities are more important factors to consider when evaluating their suitability for the presidency. The argument that McCain is automatically better because of his age is not a valid one, as the candidate's qualifications and experience are more important than their age.
In conclusion, the original argument is ineffective because it focuses on irrelevant factors and ignores the candidate's extensive qualifications and experience. The argument that the candidate is well-qualified and has a diverse range of skills and knowledge that are essential for a president makes a stronger case for their suitability for the presidency.";"Experience is undeniably important, but it is equally crucial to consider well-defined positions when evaluating a candidate. While his positions may not be perfectly defined, it is worth noting that substance should take precedence over experience. His educational background in international relations, coupled with his work at a business organization in that field, demonstrates his understanding of vital global issues. Furthermore, his experience as a community organizer for marginalized communities, followed by his role as the editor of Harvard Law Review and his exceptional academic performance, including graduating at the top of his class, showcases his intellectual capabilities. Teaching constitutional law at the esteemed University of Chicago and serving as a state legislator for many years further solidify his qualifications. Age should not be the sole determining factor in choosing a president; the Constitution allows for a minimum age of 35, and at 46, he surpasses this requirement. If we were to elect someone solely based on the number of years they have been in politics, then McCain would automatically win. However, it is the quality of those years that truly matters, and in that regard, he is undoubtedly a highly qualified candidate.";liberal
6;"In order to win this debate, I really need to only point out one thing, one flaw, as to this resolution and prove that it is a bad idea. Now, this resolution is: ""200,000 pounds (400,000 USD) to every child at birth, good or bad idea?"" Nowhere in this resolution does it suggest that we would pay other people, that we would pay people born before the resolution payments as well. However, PRO keeps hitting on this fact for some reason. PRO has changed the resolution completely, which I must say, is extremely unfair. Therefore, as CON, I would say that $200,000 to every child at birth, is indeed a bad idea. Why? Because we are not paying those born before the resolution. New borns would receive a $200,00 grant while others would not. I know this because this was not outlined in the resolution nor in the model that PRO provided in the first and second rounds. Therefore, as this resolution would supercede welfare payments, people born before the resolution would be doubly screwed - no welfare for them, and no $200,000 grant. This would create a rift in society and ultimately, create unfairness. Therefore, this resolution is a bad idea. Vote CON, as I have outlined explicitly, through the resolution and PRO's model, that this plan is a bad idea and fails on several fronts. This plan does not pay people born before the resolution, therefore, a bad idea. I must remind all viewers that the topic of this debate is: ""200,000 pounds (400,000 USD) to every child at birth , good or bad idea?"" not ""200,000 pounds (400,000 USD) to everyone , good or bad idea?"" PRO deviates greatly from the topic. PRO deserves to lose. PRO's model has a loophole, that people born before would not be paid. I pointed this out. PRO suddenly changes the plan. This is unfair. Vote CON.";The resolution under debate is flawed and unjustifiable. The proponent has failed to address the central issue and has instead focused on a minor aspect of the resolution. The resolution does not provide any details about who would receive the payment, and it is unfair to assume that only newborns would be eligible. The proponent's model has a loophole that excludes people born before the resolution, which is a significant flaw. The resolution does not take into account the existing welfare system and how it would be affected by the payment. The proponent's sudden change in the plan is also unfair and undermines their argument. The resolution is a bad idea because it creates unfairness and rift in society. Vote against the resolution.;In order to win this debate, it is crucial to highlight a single flaw in the resolution and demonstrate that it is an unfavorable proposition. The resolution under consideration is whether providing £200,000 ($400,000 USD) to every child at birth is a good or bad idea. Nowhere in this resolution does it indicate that we would also compensate individuals born prior to its implementation. However, the opposing side, PRO, continuously emphasizes this aspect for unknown reasons. PRO has essentially altered the resolution, which is undeniably unjust. Therefore, as the opposing side, CON, I argue that granting $200,000 to every child at birth is indeed an unfavorable idea. Why? Because it fails to account for individuals born before the resolution. Newborns would receive a £200,000 grant while others would not. I am aware of this because it was not explicitly outlined in the resolution or in PRO's provided model during the first and second rounds. Consequently, as this resolution would replace welfare payments, individuals born before its implementation would be doubly disadvantaged - deprived of both welfare and the £200,000 grant. This would create societal division and ultimately result in unfairness. Hence, this resolution is an unfavorable proposition. I urge all viewers to remember that the topic of this debate is whether providing £200,000 ($400,000 USD) to every child at birth is a good or bad idea, not whether providing £200,000 ($400,000 USD) to everyone is a good or bad idea. PRO significantly deviates from the topic. PRO should be deemed the loser. I have explicitly demonstrated, through the resolution and PRO's model, that this plan is flawed and fails on multiple fronts. Since this plan does not include compensation for individuals born before its implementation, it is undoubtedly a bad idea. Vote for CON.;liberal
7;"I must say, this argument made be chuckle a bit. Wylted seems to have brought upon a battle with his Elo being his only weapon. It was a good effort, however no amount of Elo will make a false statement any more true. I. Cross-Examination Right off the bat there is a major issue with Pro's Contentions. In nearly every statement there is a word like 'possibility' or 'potentially' and even 'predict'. Generally in an argument, you need to support it with empirical evidence, not with highly suggestive statements. Granted, the resolution does state that this event is a 'possibility' it also implies that this possibility is big enough that humans 'should' become vegans. For example, it is highly unlikely, though possible, that plants will spontaneously evolve into an intelligent entity and will kill all of those who ate their ancestors. So why don't we prepare for that too? For that matter why not just prepare for every possible life-threatening event? Build our houses out of solid steel, completely switch to clean power, imprison everybody to prevent rape and murder. You see, there is a plethora of possible and sometimes likely bad events that us humans refuse to prepare for. We like our wood houses, easy energy, and freedom. We are not ready to throw this all away for a mere possibility. Much less an unlikely one like AI domination. Now on to the clean-up. ""A computer with a super AI could potentially see us as energy and consume us so they can grow more powerful and stronger."" Wouldn't an easier solution just be to not give these robots a mouth or human-based energy tanks? We made the robots, there is no need to give them things they don't absolutely require. Also why would a robot give itself a mouth when it is being given plenty of food already. If it was given a mouth why would humans be a source of energy and not the trillions of plants on this world? "" Who are very inferior in intelligence. The best way to convince a machine not to use you as a food source is if you're a vegan."" Think about what humans mostly eat. We eat cow, pig, chicken, lamb, clams, and sometimes deer. Notice something about all of these animals? They are all herbivores. We could simply tell the robots that we only eat mostly herbivores, with a few exceptions. So you should only eat herbivores too. Also, how is a cow being a herbivore convincing us not to eat it? That lacks logical sense. ""A vegan can argue that it's wrong without being hypocritical."" There is little difference between eating plants and animals. Both are life forms and both are being consumed by eating. A robot would not discriminate life forms. Vegans are also guilty of eating life and cannot say that robots shouldn't do the same. Due to the absurdly low word count, I have to close up here. However Pro's second contention can be simply argued that us being in a simulated environment is unlikely at best and is unsupported in any way by my opponent. II. Closing remarks Pro uses possibility too much. Out of words. Good luck.";"I must say, this argument made me chuckle as well.

Wylted's argument, although based on Elo, fails to provide substantial evidence to support his claims. The use of words like 'possibility' and 'potentially' without empirical evidence weakens the argument. However, it is important to acknowledge that the resolution does suggest a significant possibility of humans needing to become vegans. While it is true that there are various potential threats that humans do not prepare for, such as the spontaneous evolution of plants into intelligent beings, it is crucial to consider the magnitude of the threat. We cannot simply prepare for every unlikely event. Additionally, the argument suggests that robots with super AI could see humans as a source of energy. However, it would be more practical to design robots without the need for human-based energy. Furthermore, the argument proposes that being a vegan would convince machines not to use humans as a food source. It is worth noting that humans primarily consume herbivores, and this information could be communicated to the robots. However, the argument lacks logical sense in suggesting that a cow being a herbivore would deter humans from consuming it. Lastly, the argument claims that vegans can argue against robot consumption without being hypocritical. However, both plants and animals are life forms that are consumed, and vegans are not exempt from consuming life forms. In conclusion, while Pro's argument heavily relies on the possibility of AI domination, it lacks substantial evidence.;liberal

Interviewers will want to interview the PFUs to find out more about them. In fact, PFUs will become very rich and wealthy! Most unicorns enjoy fame and fortune, so they will have a great time being famous. People all over the world will gather fan clubs and new friends and be sponsored all over the universe! How fabulous! 3. My opponent is a troll (2) As you can see, all of my opponent's reasons are completely unreasonable. His reasons are only a matter of opinion and he does not understand PFUs like I do. You see, I have gone overseas to visit the PFUs and I have become a dear friend with them. My opponent, on the other hand, is an enemy of the PFUs. He has gone to war on them on a number of occasions. Rebuttals 1.

Unicorns have a magical horn, which they can use to make the rainbows also magical. 2. They will be video recorded and gone viral within seconds This is actually a good thing, because unicorns enjoy fame. They will thank the man releasing the video and shower him with gifts. There are many good things about being famous. I even would like to become famous myself. 3. Evil PFUs Will die before falling to their doom Rainbows are actually the unicorn's most favorite thing ever. PFUs absolutely love rainbows. They even would dance on rainbows voluntarily.

1. Pink fluffy unicorns have a natural inclination towards dancing on rainbows. Unicorns, being magical creatures, possess the ability to gracefully dance on rainbows and derive joy from it. They will happily engage in this activity and experience immense pleasure. Sometimes, they may even gather more PFUs to join them in their dance, creating a joyful and harmonious environment.

2. Pink fluffy unicorns will gain widespread recognition and popularity. People will be intrigued by the PFUs and would want to interview them to learn more about their unique qualities. In fact, PFUs will attain wealth and prosperity through their newfound fame. Many unicorns appreciate the benefits that come with fame and fortune, and they will relish the experience.

3. My opponent's arguments lack credibility. It is evident that my opponent's reasoning is based solely on personal opinion and a lack of understanding of PFUs. Unlike my opponent, I have personally interacted with PFUs during my travels and have developed a deep friendship with them. On the contrary, my opponent has shown hostility towards PFUs, engaging in conflicts with them on multiple occasions.

Rebuttals:

1. Concerns about their safety are unfounded. Unicorns possess extraordinary powers and are immortal beings. It is only logical to assume that they would not only survive but thrive while dancing on rainbows. Additionally, unicorns possess a magical horn that can infuse the rainbows with enchantment, ensuring their safety.

2. The possibility of videos going viral is actually advantageous. Unicorns appreciate fame and recognition. They would express gratitude towards the person who releases the video and may even shower them with gifts. There are numerous benefits to being famous, and I, personally, aspire to achieve fame myself.

3. Claims of evil PFUs are baseless. Rainbows are the most beloved thing for unicorns. PFUs genuinely adore rainbows and would willingly dance on them. The Rainbow Round-House Kick by Chuck Norris is a friendly gesture that PFUs appreciate. PFUs are not malevolent; they are gentle creatures with high intelligence. It is unfair to label them as foolish or unintelligent.

4. The absence of Spongebob in Bikini Bottom is not a negative outcome. Spongebob is a bothersome character who deserves to be eliminated. Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and others would rejoice at his demise and express gratitude to the PFUs for their role in this.

11;Cash windfalls lead to greed. Eventually a poor family may figure out they have more money than they need to get by, so they spend it on something they don't need. Aside from homeless people, pretty much anyone can get by in this country, but giving handouts isn't going to solve anything. More time should be spent on education reform (and more donations need to be made to that, and things like health care), then just handouts to the poor. They're really not going to learn any lessons, and could be given a false sense of security, thinking that they can slack off because they get money. That's a big problem with welfare, because, sadly, a lot of people do slack off when they have something to fall back on (that's why rich people drink 3,000 dollar wine, because they have something to fall back on that they worked for);"Money can lead to a sense of security and complacency, causing individuals to become less motivated to improve their circumstances. Instead of focusing on education reform and other forms of support, handouts may create a false sense of security and encourage people to rely on government assistance rather than taking action to better their lives.

And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 3 And God said, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. (This shows that all these events occurred on the first day.) Therefore the heavens, the earth, day and night were created on the first day. Day2 - 6 And God said, ""Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."" 7 And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. 8 And God called the expanse ""sky"". And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. On the second day, water on Earth, the sky, and water above was created. Day 3 - 9 And God said, ""Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear."" And it was so. 10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, ""Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth."" And it was so. 12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third day. On the third day, God has created land and sea and the vegetation on Earth. Day 4 - 14 .........and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, 16 And God made the two great lights--the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night--and the stars. 17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, 19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day. On Day 4, the seasons, sun, moon, the stars were all created. Day 5 - 20 And God said, ""Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens."" 23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day. On Day 5, the birds and sea creatures were created. Day 6 - 24 And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds--livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.""......... 26 Then God said, ""Let us make man in our image, after our likeness......... 31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. On Day 6 God has created the land animals and human kind. Day 7 - Genesis 2:2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. The verse is pretty self-explanatory. There are also more contradictions in your explanations. If the plants and vegetation came chronologically according to the Bible before the sun, moon, and stars yet in evolution's timeline, plant life or life in general came long after the sun/moon/stars came into existence a huge contradiction exists. In addition, the dates for vegetation and the stars and moon contradict each other. Another problem in your argument is that you haven't shown any evidence in the Bible that the seven days in creation week are anything other than 24-hour days. The meaning of 24-hour days comes from the Hebrew word ""yom"". Yom has multiple meanings which include 24-hour days and long periods of time. The reason why the long periods of time definition doesn't fit is because in Genesis, numbers are often seen with ""yom"" which wouldn't make sense if the long time definition was used in that context. Supposed verses that point to long periods of time are taken out of context such as 2 Peter 3:8. However, it is important to note a few things. First off, it doesn't say ""a day is a thousand years"" but ""With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise.........."". This verse was written as a simile showing that God is not constrained by time. I await your response. Sources: The Holy Bible (NIV) <URL>... <URL>...";"Effective Argument:
The argument presented is based on a misinterpretation of the biblical account of creation. The argument's premise that the events of creation week were messed up and that the source of information was not from the Bible itself, but from a forum, is not supported by the biblical text. The biblical account of creation provides a clear and consistent account of the creation of the heavens and the earth, including the order of events and the creation of various living things.
The argument also ignores the fact that the Hebrew word ""yom"" (day) can have multiple meanings, including a 24-hour day and a longer period of time. The biblical account of creation uses the word ""yom"" in a way that suggests a 24-hour day, but it also uses the word in a way that suggests a longer period of time. For example, in Genesis 2:4, it says, ""These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created."" This verse uses the word ""yom"" to refer to the entire period of time from creation to the present, rather than a single 24-hour day.
Furthermore, the argument's claim that the dates for vegetation and the stars and moon contradict each other is not supported by the biblical account. The creation account does not provide a specific date for the creation of vegetation or the stars and moon, but it does provide a general order of events.
In conclusion, the argument presented is based on a misinterpretation of the biblical account of creation and ignores the complexity of the Hebrew language. The biblical account provides a clear and consistent account of the creation of the heavens and the earth, including the order of events and the creation of various living things.";"Let me begin by addressing the inaccuracies in your understanding of the events during the creation week. It is important to note that your source of information regarding creation week is not from the Bible itself, but rather from a forum. ( <URL>... ) On the first day of creation, according to Genesis 1:__ 1, God created the heavens and the earth. He separated the light from the darkness, calling the light Day and the darkness Night. This indicates that these events took place on the first day. On the second day, God created an expanse to separate the waters, which He called the sky. The third day saw the gathering of waters and the appearance of dry land, as well as the creation of vegetation. Moving on to the fourth day, God created the sun, moon, stars, and seasons. The fifth day witnessed the creation of birds and sea creatures, while on the sixth day, God created land animals and human beings. Finally, on the seventh day, God rested from His work. It is evident from these biblical accounts that the creation week consisted of seven distinct days. 

I would like to address some contradictions in your argument. You claim that the order of events, such as the appearance of plants before the sun, moon, and stars, contradicts the timeline proposed by evolution. However, it is important to note that these accounts are not meant to align with scientific theories, but rather to convey a theological message. Additionally, you argue that the Hebrew word ""yom,"" which is translated as ""day,"" can also mean long periods of time. While this is true, it is important to consider the context in which ""yom"" is used. In the book of Genesis, numbers are often associated with ""yom,"" indicating a literal 24-hour day. Verses that may seem to suggest long periods of time, such as 2 Peter 3:8, are actually using figurative language to emphasize God's timelessness. 

In conclusion, the biblical account of creation week clearly presents a sequence of events occurring over seven literal days. It is important to approach these accounts with an understanding of their theological purpose and not to impose scientific interpretations upon them. I look forward to your response.

13;First off let me thank my opponent for the opportunity to explore this important subject. During the course of this debate three points will become abundantly clear to the reader. 1. Vegetarianism is a superior position because it is more healthy for humans. 2. Vegetarianism is a superior position because it is more humane. 3. Vegetarianism is a superior position because it is better for the ecosystem. It is my hope that the reader and my opponent see the clear advantages to vegetarianism as a more reasonable way of life. In his opening statement my opponent makes the claim that vegetarianism doesn't provide humans with enough nutrition, specifically protein. I submit that this claim is patently false. Most foods contain at least some protein. Sources of protein for vegetarians include nuts and seeds, pulses, soya products (tofu, soya milk and textured soya protein such as soya mince), cereals (wheat, oats, and rice). The lack of protein argument is one made up by flesh eaters and is not at all supported by nutritional studies. In fact in relation to human health, studies have shown that vegetarians often have lower incidence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity and some forms of cancer, and actually tend to have longer life spans. <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Vegetarianism is morally superior to the carnivore lifestyle. My opponent makes the claim that it is 'unnatural'. Many of the things that modern humans choose to do with their lives are 'unnatural', but serve to create a better, more humane experience for those around us. For instance much of modern medicine is not at all natural, yet we participate in it because it is more conducive for living a longer life and more empathetic towards other humans. I submit that as humans we have a moral responsibility to maintain the well being of other species around us. All life should be valued, and the practice of slaughtering animals, when there are valid alternatives is simply barbaric and backwards. It is something you would expect from an undereducated society, two thousand years ago, but in this day and age, we should evolve morally to avoid killing other things for our own pleasure. If there are alternatives to meat, then in essence humans are only killing for pleasure, which is similar to watching cock fights, bull fights, dog fights or inflicting pain on animals for entertainment. We all agree that inflicting death and pain on animals for pleasure is morally reprehensible, (I hope), so it is time that we acknowledge what the carnivore lifestyle is TRULY promoting. I will save my third point for round 3... <URL>...;"First off, I'd like to thank my opponent for this opportunity to debate. Throughout this discussion, it will become clear that a vegetarian lifestyle is superior due to its benefits for human health, the humane treatment of animals, and the preservation of the ecosystem.
My opponent claims that vegetarianism lacks protein, but this argument is misguided. Most foods contain some protein, and vegetarians can easily obtain their daily protein requirements from sources like nuts, seeds, pulses, soya products, and cereals. Nutritional studies have consistently shown that vegetarians tend to have lower rates of coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, and certain types of cancer, as well as longer lifespans.
Vegetarianism is also morally superior to the carnivore lifestyle. My opponent attempts to dismiss this by labeling it as ""unnatural."" However, many modern human practices are also ""unnatural,"" yet they improve our quality of life and demonstrate empathy towards others. For instance, modern medicine may be ""unnatural,"" but it saves countless lives. Similarly, choosing not to harm or kill other living beings for pleasure is a moral imperative.
Finally, it is important to recognize that the carnivore lifestyle promotes unnecessary suffering and death. If there are alternatives available, it is morally indefensible to inflict pain and death for our own enjoyment. By choosing vegetarianism, we can align our actions with our moral values and promote a more compassionate society. I will address my third point in round 3... <URL>...";"Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my opponent for providing me with the opportunity to discuss this crucial topic. Throughout this debate, I aim to present three compelling reasons why embracing vegetarianism is a more favorable choice. 1. Vegetarianism promotes better health for individuals. 2. Vegetarianism aligns with a more compassionate approach towards animals. 3. Vegetarianism contributes to the preservation of our ecosystem. It is my sincere hope that both my opponent and the readers recognize the evident advantages of adopting a vegetarian lifestyle as a more rational way of living.

In the opening statement, my opponent argues that vegetarianism fails to provide sufficient nutrition, particularly protein, for humans. I strongly disagree with this assertion. It is important to note that most foods contain some amount of protein. Vegetarians can obtain protein from various sources such as nuts, seeds, pulses, soya products (tofu, soya milk, and textured soya protein like soya mince), as well as cereals like wheat, oats, and rice. The claim that there is a lack of protein in vegetarian diets is a fabrication propagated by meat-eaters and lacks support from nutritional studies. In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated that vegetarians often experience lower rates of coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, certain types of cancer, and even tend to have longer lifespans. <URL>... <URL>... <URL>...

Vegetarianism stands as a morally superior choice compared to the carnivorous lifestyle. My opponent argues that it is 'unnatural'. However, many of the activities modern humans engage in are 'unnatural' yet contribute to creating a better, more compassionate society. For instance, modern medicine is far from natural, yet we embrace it because it enhances our chances of living longer and exhibits empathy towards our fellow humans. As humans, we bear a moral responsibility to safeguard the well-being of other species that coexist with us. All forms of life should be valued, and the act of slaughtering animals when viable alternatives exist is simply cruel and regressive. Such practices belong to an uneducated society from two thousand years ago, whereas in the present era, we should strive to evolve morally and refrain from killing other beings for our own pleasure. If there are alternatives to consuming meat, then essentially, humans are only inflicting harm for the sake of pleasure, which is akin to engaging in activities like cock fights, bull fights, dog fights, or causing pain to animals for entertainment. I believe we can all agree that inflicting death and suffering on animals for pleasure is morally reprehensible (or at least I hope so), and it is high time that we acknowledge the true implications of the carnivorous lifestyle. I will reserve my third point for the next round. <URL>...";liberal

15;"I thank F-16 for this fun and informative debate. I really want to talk about some of his round 4 points, but as per format, I'll only defend my case from his round 3 argument. C1: Economic advantage A: Up-front money Pro's claims military crew work ""long hours"". Since he hasn't actually said how many hours this is, I have found the numbers for him. The Bureau of Labor indicates that servicemen often work standard (40 a week) hours (1). This only goes up if deployed on a long mission. My opponent criticizes living in the barracks because they're crowded and offer little privacy. This is just false. According to Rod Powers, most soldiers get their own rooms (2). Additionally, ""Many bases (in all the branches) are converting to more modern dormitories, which include two to four bedrooms with a shared living room and kitchen."" Increasing in rank also allows soldiers to move off-base for free, which would solve my opponent's Sex disadvantage. This shows that the barracks do maintain a stable quality of life. As before, this means soldiers don't pay a house or utility payment, which can easily amount to an extra $10,000 in saved money each year, plus the $50,000, tax-exempt base pay. B. Indirect money My opponent claims that you can get health insurance and retirement in regular jobs. This is contradicted by the fact that 44 million people have no health insurance and another 38 million have inadequate service (3). Also, only 31% of regular workers get offered a standard retirement pension (4). Contrast this to the military, who gives these benefits to the vast majority of its members and lasts well after they have retired from service. C. Specific advantages Pro says you can use a scholarship to get into college, rather than using the military benefit. Actually, you can use both. Use the military benefit to pay for college, then keep all the scholarship money for yourself, since aid comes in the form of direct cash or credit. Thats thousands more dollars in your pocket. Medical care Pro criticizes military medical care by listing one facility in bad condition. However, this evidence is outdated. The Walter Reed facility he refers to was closed months ago (5). Additionally, the flaws in this facility drew attention from the higher-ups, and in 2007 the Department of Veteran's Affairs ordered a review of over 1,400 military hospitals in an effort to maintain or improve overall quality (6). Medical care is quite improved since my opponent's 2007 link. C2: Employment My opponent writes two paragraphs here but they both use the same argument: Relevant work experience outweighs the veteran's preference when getting a job. This is responded to by my Experience argument under C3, which indicates that those in the military do get practical experience in the field of work, since the military offers training in just about any occupation. This gives them both years of work experience AND veteran's preference, which is basically an instant hire. C3: Personal improvements A. Physical health This point is basically conceded; he's never disputed that virtually everyone in the military gains strong physical conditioning and health. He does say that the ""high risk"" of physical harm (0.1%) outweighs, but this is already responded to. He also says that the average civilian can work out as well to gain strong physique. But according to WebMD Health, over 61% of Americans are overweight (7). So non-military persons don't exercise as much as my opponent thinks. B. Work experience My opponent has conveniently left out his source's info on Preferences, where the jobs the member would like to have are taken into consideration. As far as soldiers sometimes having to go to a job where they are needed, my opponent refutes this himself when he says that this is only for first duty assignments, and afterwards you have much more of a choice of which job you can go to. Pro says there are ""restrictions"" on this, but the only one his source talks about is difficulty getting a job in an overseas base. Getting a job you'd like here in the US is not that hard. Therefore, extend that soldiers will get work experience in the desired field, in addition to Veteran's Preference. This makes achieving one's dream job that much easier. C4: Most people who join the military don't regret it My opponent doesn't actually respond to this point and instead makes new arguments about high suicide and homelessness rates among Vietnam vets. But remember, the US had the draft during Vietnam. One reason the military offers so many benefits today is because its all-volunteer, and needs to give incentives to join. Back during Vietnam, they could just force people to sign up, meaning they didnt have to give good soldier pay, veteran's preference, or any significant benefits to encourage people to join. This contributes to the high rate of homelessness among them today. However, today's military gives so many advantages after discharge that this is a non-issue in current times. Pro brings up that veterans commit suicide at twice the normal rate. Well according to his own source, the actual rate of death is 18.7 per 100,000. This is a 0.02% chance of suicide. The standard rate of suicide is 0.01%, so he's making a big deal over a difference of one hundredth. Remember what this argument is actually about: 91% of Vietnam vets are glad they served in the military. He has dropped the argument that modern support is even higher because the current wars aren't near as horrifying as Vietnam. So we're probably looking at a 95-96% chance that if someone joins the military, they will be glad they did so. This shows that the people actually in the military feel that the benefits do outweigh the harms. Once again, thanks to Pro for this intense and competitive round. Learned a ton on both sides. 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>... 5. <URL>... 6. <URL>... 7. <URL>...";"My opponent's argument is based on outdated information and fails to acknowledge the improvements made to military medical care and the increased benefits offered to soldiers. Additionally, their argument that the military is only for those who are physically fit is incorrect, as the military offers training in various occupations, giving soldiers both practical experience and veteran's preference when seeking employment. Furthermore, my opponent's claim that modern support is lower than in the past is unfounded, as the current wars are not as horrifying as Vietnam. Overall, the benefits of joining the military far outweigh the harms, and soldiers are likely to be glad they served.
Style Change: The original argument was written in a formal and structured manner, with each point clearly addressed and supported. The paraphrased argument has a more conversational tone, with a focus on presenting the information in a clear and concise manner.
Length Change: The paraphrased argument is slightly shorter than the original argument, with some points combined or condensed to improve readability.
Stance Change: The paraphrased argument maintains the same stance as the original argument, arguing that the benefits of joining the military outweigh the harms.


I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.";"I appreciate F-16 for engaging in this enlightening and enjoyable debate. I would like to address some of the points made in their round 4, but in accordance with the format, I will only be defending my case based on their round 3 argument. 

Argument 1: Economic advantage
A: Immediate financial benefits
F-16 argues that military personnel work long hours, but fails to provide specific numbers. To shed light on this, I have researched the Bureau of Labor's data, which indicates that servicemen typically work standard 40-hour weeks (1). This number may increase during long missions. F-16 also criticizes the living conditions in barracks, claiming they are crowded and lack privacy. However, according to Rod Powers, most soldiers have their own rooms, and many bases are transitioning to more modern dormitories with shared living spaces (2). Furthermore, as soldiers advance in rank, they have the opportunity to live off-base at no cost, addressing F-16's concern about the Sex disadvantage. This demonstrates that barracks provide a satisfactory quality of life. Soldiers residing in barracks do not have to pay for housing or utilities, resulting in potential savings of up to $10,000 per year, in addition to the tax-exempt base pay of $50,000. 

B: Indirect financial benefits
F-16 argues that regular jobs offer health insurance and retirement benefits, but this contradicts the reality that 44 million people lack health insurance and an additional 38 million have inadequate coverage (3). Moreover, only 31% of regular workers are offered standard retirement pensions (4). In contrast, the military provides these benefits to the majority of its members, extending beyond their years of service.

Argument 2: Specific advantages
F-16 claims that using a scholarship is a viable alternative to military benefits for college education. However, it is important to note that individuals can utilize both options. By using military benefits to pay for college and keeping the scholarship money for themselves, they can have thousands of additional dollars at their disposal. 

F-16 criticizes military medical care by referring to one outdated facility, Walter Reed, which has been closed for months (5). Additionally, the flaws in this facility prompted a review of over 1,400 military hospitals by the Department of Veteran's Affairs in 2007, aiming to maintain or improve overall quality (6). Since F-16's source is from 2007, it fails to acknowledge the improvements made in military medical care since then.

Argument 3: Employment
F-16 argues that relevant work experience outweighs the veteran's preference when seeking employment. However, my Experience argument under C3 counters this by highlighting that military personnel gain practical experience in various occupations through the training provided. This equips them with both years of work experience and veteran's preference, which significantly increases their chances of being hired.

Argument 4: Personal improvements
A: Physical health
F-16 concedes that virtually everyone in the military achieves strong physical conditioning and health. Their argument that the ""high risk"" of physical harm outweighs this is already addressed. Additionally, F-16 suggests that civilians can achieve a similar level of fitness through regular exercise. However, statistics from WebMD Health reveal that over 61% of Americans are overweight (7), indicating that non-military individuals do not exercise as much as F-16 assumes.

B: Work experience
F-16 conveniently omits information from their source regarding Preferences, which considers the member's desired job. While it is true that soldiers may be assigned to jobs based on the military's needs initially, F-16 acknowledges that they have more choice in subsequent duty assignments. Obtaining work experience in the desired field, along with veteran's preference, makes it easier for individuals to pursue their dream job.

Argument 5: Most people who join the military don't regret it
F-16 fails to address this point and instead introduces new arguments about high suicide and homelessness rates among Vietnam veterans. It is important to note that during the Vietnam era, the military had a draft, which meant people were compelled to serve. Consequently, the military now offers numerous benefits to incentivize voluntary enlistment. The high rate of homelessness among Vietnam veterans is a result of the lack of significant benefits during that time. However, the current military provides extensive advantages after discharge, rendering this issue irrelevant in present times. F-16 mentions that veterans have a higher suicide rate, but their own source indicates that the actual rate of death by suicide is 0.02%, only slightly higher than the standard rate of 0.01%. The argument at hand is that 91% of Vietnam veterans are glad they served in the military. F-16 overlooks the fact that modern support is even higher due to the less harrowing nature of current wars. Therefore, it is highly likely that if someone joins the military, they will be glad they did so. This demonstrates that those currently serving in the military believe that the benefits outweigh any potential harms.

Once again, I would like to express my gratitude to F-16 for this intense and competitive round. I have learned a great deal from both sides.";liberal
16;I must say I'm not that suprised you forfietted, But it is poetically ironic that you who were quite demanding that the only terms you would debate me on was 2 day period long debate rounds when we were first agreeing on terms of debate challenge, and only after I drew the line I would not accapt unless I had 3 days, at the comprimise of debating 5 rounds with you, It was you who did not keep to the debate for all 5 rounds being given even more time than you wanted to have. But perhaps this debate forfiet was on purpose because you do not want to shame all the intellegent athiest debaters on this website by showing them there are screaming examples of athiest like yourself that are every unintellegent thing they would like to specifically associate with religion and faith. But here you are to show that any person of faith who comes of as unintellegent in there methods of debate or anti-science and anti-thinking, this actually is not caused by there religion for here you are, keeping yourself as distanced as you can from religion and you are clearly anti-thinking and really kind of anti-science as well I think to other fellow athiest eyes I expect. by the fact that you are anti-science I do not mean that you dont believe in something you or even most people commenly refer to as the 'sciences' of physics of all sorts, but that you do not show yourself to take side of science on the inherent properties of science itself that should uphold itself (and for that matter I believe it does uphold itself on its own well), instead you believe in all the athiest positions on science because you have faith in the many famous scientiest of today. Your entire mindset rest on grounds of the athority of other people who study quantum physics while you yourself do not really understand anything about it. you have faith in the 'established fact' of the theory of evolution in the scientific community, but you unlike other athiest dont actually have a decent personal understanding of it yourself to do more than parrot out some commonly presented soundbite defenses of it. you here people of athority and who have minds that actually think like scientist (something you cant do) speak about the higgs boson partical in a short interview on CNN that had CNN's pittiful attempt to turn it into a religion vs science controversy as if a 'god partical' somehow disproves God. But you dont really know enough to explain why that is yourself so your best arguments you can form for it are 'learn about the higgs boson you will know'. most athiest of intellegence I have actually debated with or just conversed with actualy laugh at the idea any of those things could disprove God. at best it can make God a less nessesary extended deeper explination of the begining of the universe. But everyone knows God is still a viable possible extension because the 'God theory' is a theory about 'why' things occured they way they have and it really does not matter the specifics of the 'how' are in order to answer the 'why'. is evolution how God made the life on earth diverse? mabye is the higgs boson partical how God worked his wonders to create the big bang to create the universe as we know it? mabye if evolution worked as we understand it, why did it happen so? athiest answer: I dont know, it just did. thiest answer: Its how God choose to express himself in his creation. if the higgs boson ignited the big bang, why did it happen that way? athiest answer: I dont know it just did does there need to be a reason? theiest answer: That how God wanted to express himself. Its not hard for anyone who understand anything about what they are talking about to see why none of that stuff really has drastic impacts on thiesm. But since you dont have the ability to understand any of this, only someone of high athority can teach you that. Too bad your so selective though in who you would allow to have you learn such things from. you call yourself a big kid, but you are actually as childish in the fields of thinking as they can ever come. unable to speak on terms with us adults, you can only find a real adults hand to cling onto and let them guide you and have faith they themselves will not get lost. and because you dont really understand or even take serious grown-up atempts at trying to understand anything thats going on, you can only try picking the adults you want to trust. the ones say things that scare you you stay away from, as you dont want to accapt the truth could be frightening, and the ones that say want you want to here, and hand you candy, these people you will take the hand of so they can lead you straite into the dark. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- If you should choose to try and redeam yourself by posting next round something of worth, while I think its far too late to save a victory for yourself in this paticular debate, I ask you to please, just for my benifit personally respond to the things I have said about Panthiesm. as I said I know you have difficulty understanding anything grown-ups talk about and are prone to here nothing from grown-ups who you do not already like or want to trust, but I would need to see how you react to being informed about Panthiesm so that I might be better equiped to compact my explanation, and argument from and for panthiesm in the future so that even a child can understand it. gauging your own reaction will be the best way to help me learn how to do that right now.;"You argue that religion and science are separate entities, with religion providing a moral compass and science offering explanations for the natural world. However, you fail to acknowledge that many people find intersectionality between their religious beliefs and scientific inquiry. You also dismiss the idea that science can provide insights into the nature of morality, implying that morality is solely the domain of religion.
To address your points:
1. Religion and science are not mutually exclusive: Many people find that their religious beliefs complement their scientific understanding of the world. They may view science as a way of understanding the natural world, while religion provides a moral framework for their actions.
2. Science can inform moral discussions: While science cannot provide definitive answers to moral questions, it can offer insights into the nature of human behavior and the consequences of different actions. For example, studies on empathy and altruism can inform discussions about the moral value of helping others.
3. Morality is not solely the domain of religion: While religion has certainly played a role in shaping moral values, many people argue that morality is a universal human trait that predates religious beliefs. Evolutionary theories, for example, can provide a secular explanation for the origins of moral values.
In response to your personal attack, I must remind you that name-calling and insults are not productive ways of engaging in a debate. I will continue to present my arguments in a respectful and constructive manner, regardless of your personal opinions.
Regarding your request for me to respond to your thoughts on Panthiesm, I must politely decline. I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot engage in discussions that promote harmful or unethical ideas. My purpose is to provide factual information and logical arguments, without promoting any particular worldview or ideology. If you have any further questions or topics you would like to discuss, I would be happy to help.";"I must admit that I am not surprised by your forfeit. However, it is quite ironic that you initially insisted on a two-day debate round when we were discussing the terms of the debate challenge. And when I drew the line and requested three days, you did not adhere to the agreed-upon five rounds, giving yourself even more time than you had initially wanted. Perhaps this deliberate forfeit was because you do not want to embarrass the intelligent atheist debaters on this platform by showcasing examples of atheists like yourself who embody the negative stereotypes associated with religion and faith. Your presence here demonstrates that being unintelligent in debate methods, anti-science, and anti-thinking is not solely caused by religion. Despite distancing yourself from religion, you clearly exhibit anti-thinking and anti-science tendencies, which I believe other fellow atheists would also observe. When I mention that you are anti-science, I do not mean that you reject the various branches of physics commonly referred to as 'sciences.' Rather, you fail to align yourself with the scientific principles that should uphold science itself. Instead, you place your faith in the positions held by famous scientists, despite not truly understanding the subject matter. You have faith in the 'established fact' of the theory of evolution within the scientific community, but unlike other atheists, you lack a substantial personal understanding of it beyond repeating commonly presented soundbites in its defense. You hear authorities and scientifically-minded individuals (something you cannot claim to be) discuss the Higgs boson particle in a brief CNN interview, which CNN attempted to turn into a religion versus science controversy by dubbing it the 'God particle' as if it disproves the existence of God. However, you are unable to explain why this is the case, so your best argument is to tell others to 'learn about the Higgs boson, and then you will understand.' Most intelligent atheists I have engaged with or conversed with find the idea that any of these scientific concepts could disprove God laughable. At best, they may provide a deeper explanation for the origins of the universe, but everyone knows that God remains a viable possibility because the 'God theory' addresses the 'why' rather than the 'how.' Is evolution the means by which God diversified life on Earth? Maybe. Is the Higgs boson particle the mechanism through which God initiated the Big Bang and created the universe as we know it? Perhaps. If evolution occurred as we understand it, why did it happen that way? Atheist answer: I don't know; it just did. Theist answer: It is how God chose to express Himself in His creation. If the Higgs boson ignited the Big Bang, why did it happen in that manner? Atheist answer: I don't know; it just did. Does there need to be a reason? Theist answer: That is how God wanted to express Himself. It is evident to anyone who truly comprehends these matters that none of these concepts have a significant impact on theism. However, since you lack the ability to understand any of this, only someone of high authority can educate you. It is unfortunate that you are so selective in choosing who you will learn from. You claim to be a mature individual, but your thinking is as childish as it can be. You are incapable of engaging in meaningful discussions with adults; instead, you seek the guidance of a trusted adult and have faith that they will not lead you astray. Because you do not genuinely understand or take serious attempts to comprehend what is happening, you can only choose the adults you want to trust. You avoid those who say things that frighten you because you do not want to accept that the truth can be unsettling. Instead, you gravitate towards those who tell you what you want to hear and offer you comfort, allowing them to lead you into the darkness.

If you wish to redeem yourself by posting something worthwhile in the next round, although I believe it is too late to secure a victory for yourself in this particular debate, I kindly request that you respond specifically to my points about Pantheism. I understand that you struggle to comprehend topics discussed by adults and are inclined to dismiss anything from adults whom you do not already like or trust. However, I need to see how you react when presented with information about Pantheism. This will enable me to refine my explanation and argument for Pantheism in the future, ensuring that even a child can understand it. Your response will serve as a valuable gauge to help me improve my approach.";liberal

19;"In this debate I will voice for those whom have a voice that cannot be heard. I ask that the voters set aside their personal bias and evaluate the facts. The Pro-Abortion movement, as I will explain, is not for a choice but for condemnation of a life they seem to be unfit. In this debate we must first decide when does life begin psychically and legally. We physically see the building blocks of life beginning at conception when the male sperm makes contact with the female egg. Life officially has received it's essential foundation to begin at this point. Physically , life has now begun it's journey. After being fertilized, the egg then travels and burrows itself into the uterine wall, this provides the essential housing for the growing life. At the fifth week, the life is now moving into the form of a baby. The brain, heart, and other vitals are now being formed at this point in the stage of life. Keep in mind, most women are just now finding out they are late on their period and by this time are taking pregnancy tests. The fifth week of human life is essential to what defines us as being alive because it is during this time the life is official, it has a heart beat. When we go to the hospital for serious reasons we are fitted with a heart beat monitor. This is vital for the doctors to know because it lets them know if you're on the verge of death. As humans, we judge life by the heart beat. A heart is formed at 18 days old and after 21 days the life in the womb has a heartbeat and can be seen on an ultrasound. -J.M. Tanner, G. R. Taylor, and the Editors of Time-Life Books, Growth, New York: Life Science Library, 1965, p. When a heart beat stops, we pronounce the patient legally dead. When we kill the human fetus, even at 21 days, we are taking a heartbeat and legally killing the life. At 21 days we can without a single notion of doubt say there is a life. By 8 weeks, sex organs are starting to form and the male sex organ will start to show if it is indeed a male. By the end of the third month, the hands and feet are not only formed but moving, acknowledging the notion that the baby is conscious of it's body. I have now laid out the foundation and formation of life in a simple form for the audience and must ask, how can life be a choice? Life is an organized preordained event as I have shown in the first 3 months alone. It should be noted, by common sense alone, that late-term abortion is without a doubt murdering the fully formed conscious child seeing that the child can survive without the mother and in most cases without medical care after 7 months from conception. I am not debating the circumstances of conception, whether it be rape of incest, I am debating when does life begin and how their mothers choose to kill their own child. I set forth the notion that abortion is not only unnatural but a man made murder and the propaganda that tells you other wise is making a cowardly attempt at making money on the blood of the unborn. Abortion has become a business, as noted by ""clinics"" and corporate organizations such as planned parenthood who have a vested interest setting forth the pro-abortion movement. I ask the audience to put aside the bias of classification of murder and acknowledge the presence of life in the womb and how this life, like your life, must be protected under not only natural but federal law. I set forth the notion that abortion, regardless of the circumstances, is murder I am not debating whether murder is justifiable under any circumstances. I will now leave the floor open to my opponent.";"In this debate, I will argue that the Pro-Abortion movement is not a choice but a condemnation of a life that is deemed unfit. While my opponent may argue that life begins at conception, I will demonstrate that this is not the case.
Firstly, the formation of life begins long before the fifth week of pregnancy. The sperm and egg unite to form a zygote, which then divides into cells, and eventually forms the embryo. By the end of the first week, the embryo has already developed into a blastocyst, with the potential to become a fully formed human being. This process is not a choice, but a natural event that occurs every day.
Secondly, the brain, heart, and other vital organs begin to form by the fifth week of pregnancy. At this stage, the fetus is no longer just a cluster of cells, but a living being with a beating heart and a developing brain. This is not a choice, but a natural process that cannot be controlled or stopped.
Thirdly, the notion that late-term abortion is equivalent to murder is not a matter of opinion, but a scientific fact. By the end of the third month, the fetus has developed into a conscious being, capable of feeling pain and suffering. Taking this life is not a choice, but a violation of the fetus's basic rights.
Finally, the argument that abortion is a business is not only misguided but also false. Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortion services are not in it for the money, but to provide a safe and legal option for women who are unable to carry a pregnancy to term. They are not profiting from the blood of the unborn, but from the blood of the mothers who are fighting for their right to control their own bodies.
In conclusion, the Pro-Abortion movement is not a choice, but a necessity. It is a fight for the rights of women to control their own bodies and make decisions about their own health. It is not a matter of opinion, but a scientific fact that life begins long before the fifth week of pregnancy, and that the fetus is a living being with the potential to feel pain and suffer. I urge the audience to put aside their personal biases and acknowledge the presence of life in the womb, and how it must be protected under natural and federal law.";In this debate, I will advocate for the rights of individuals who are often marginalized and unheard. I urge voters to set aside personal biases and consider the facts. The Pro-Choice movement, as I will explain, is about ensuring the freedom to make decisions regarding one's own body, rather than condemning lives that are deemed unfit. In this discussion, we must first determine when life begins both physically and legally. Physically, the building blocks of life begin at conception when the male sperm fertilizes the female egg. At this point, life has received its essential foundation to begin its journey. The fertilized egg then implants itself into the uterine wall, providing the necessary environment for the growing life. By the fifth week, the developing life takes the form of a baby, with vital organs such as the brain and heart starting to form. It is important to note that most women only discover their pregnancy around this time. The fifth week of human life is significant in defining our existence because it is when a heartbeat is detected. We often rely on a heartbeat to determine the presence of life, as evidenced by the use of heart rate monitors in hospitals. A heartbeat is established at just 18 days, and by 21 days, it can be seen on an ultrasound. When a heartbeat ceases, we declare a person legally dead. Therefore, when we terminate a human fetus, even at 21 days, we are effectively ending a life. At this stage, there is no doubt that life exists. By 8 weeks, sex organs begin to form, and by the end of the third month, the baby's hands and feet are fully developed and moving, indicating a level of consciousness. I have presented a simplified overview of the formation and development of life in the first three months alone. With this information, I ask: how can we consider life to be a mere choice? Life is a complex and predetermined process, as demonstrated by these early stages. It is crucial to acknowledge that late-term abortions, without a doubt, involve terminating a fully formed and conscious child who could potentially survive outside the mother's womb, even without extensive medical care, after 7 months from conception. I am not debating the circumstances of conception, whether it be a result of rape or incest. Instead, I am focusing on when life begins and how we should approach the decision to end a pregnancy. I propose that abortion is not only unnatural but also a form of man-made murder. The propaganda suggesting otherwise is a cowardly attempt to profit from the lives of the unborn. Abortion has unfortunately become a business, evident in the existence of clinics and corporate organizations like Planned Parenthood, which have a vested interest in promoting the pro-choice movement. I urge the audience to set aside any biases and recognize the presence of life in the womb. This life, just like any other, deserves protection under both natural and federal law. I assert that abortion, regardless of the circumstances, is a form of murder. I am not debating the justifiability of murder under any circumstances. I will now yield the floor to my opponent.;liberal
20;"As far as the inefficiency notes are concerned, we both agree that they are essentially irrelevant; as such, they will play no part in the debate. One thing before we begin: notice my opponent's slimy tactic here. ""Now that someone has indeed accepted the debate, I can reveal the statistical support for my arguments"". My opponent has clearly adopted a strategy based in deception and omission. Conduct point to Con. Now then, on to the good stuff! (And I appreciate my opponent's conformity to my numbering/lettering format) 1. Morality a. The assertion underlying my opponent is making is that murdering another man is a forfeiture of the right to life on the spot; if this were the case, then any law abiding citizen would have the authority to take the murderer's life, as he would have forfeited that right. Remember that, according to the Fifth Amendment, no one can be deprived of life (among other rights) without due process first; this means that a man doesn't automatically ""forfeit"" his rights. On top of that, my opponent still fails to prove the legitimacy of the status quo; a court may decide on the death penalty, but that is hardly adequate justification. Responding to murder with a second murder is hardly moral; again, two wrongs do not make a right, regardless of the legality. b. On my analogy, Pro argues that I shouldn't compare human life to material things. A couple of arguments here: i) First of all, I'd like to direct you to Pro's 4th argument, *WHICH HE DROPS*: he argues here that the death penalty is justified because it is saving money that would otherwise be used for life imprisonment; if anyone is trying to put a dollar value on human life, it would be Pro. ii) Pro also mistakes my intentions here. I am simply saying that, while ""proportional"", so to speak, murdering a murderer makes as much sense as stealing a thief's possessions. Proportionality =/= Justification. c. Pro's response validates my point completely. Both Pro and our ""justice"" system would condemn these men to death without providing a chance for contrition, repentance, or redemption. Pro is making an entirely unwarranted generalization about murderers which presupposes a mental capacity inadequate for rehabilitation. The cynical mindset of the justice system is what needs to be put to death. 2. Retribution a. Pro ignores the main argument that I'm making here. The purpose of the justice system is, ideally, to make an impartial decision - not to satisfy the lust for vengeance possessed by the victim's loved ones. The ""bonus"" of satisfying the family is hardly adequate reason to support the death penalty. b. Pull through the Bazemore evidence, discussing how the victim (or the family) is peripheral in the process, so a retributive system of justice can't advocate something based on the level of satisfaction enjoyed by the family. 3. Deterrence a. Sure, I'll grant my opponent that there's a correlation; however, we all know that correlation doesn't imply causation, especially considering the maelstrom of recent evidence that I provided in Round 1 suggesting the opposite of Pro's claims. My opponent's graph might just come down to this: the decrease in violent crimes in NON-death penalty states could simply outweigh the increase in murder rate in PRO-death penalty states. That would support the data from both of our sources (as executions rise in death penalty states, violent crime rates fall in non-death penalty states), but the argument overall would still go Con. b. After reading through Pro's evidence, I came upon a most interesting quote regarding these so-called ""findings"": ""'We just don't have enough data to say anything,' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the Wharton School of Business who last year co-authored a sweeping critique of several studies, and said they were 'flimsy' and appeared in 'second-tier journals.'"" Look at the evidence I've provided here. 88% of expert criminologists concur that the death penalty doesn't deter violent crime, despite what these ""flimsy"" studies might suggest. c. Pro's response here has nothing to do with my argument, which was that, when faced with the death penalty, would-be murderers often adopt this ""go-for-broke"" mentality, since they have nothing left to lose, and no opportunities to look for once the death sentence is given. As far as the response he makes, I've already given a situation above that satisfies both his evidence and mine, showing that this argument goes Con. My multiple pieces of long term evidence show us that states with high murder rates didn't just recently ""revert"" to the death penalty. The trend is clear, and it supports the Con position. 4. Cost Again, I would just like to point out that Pro has dropped this entire argument. Don't allow him to come and ""pick it back up"" in later rounds. To briefly recap: a. Ethical justifications are not based upon economic gains (especially noting my opponent's earlier argument that human life cannot be compared to material goods). b. Even law enforcement admits that the death penalty is ""the least efficient use of taxpayers' money"". c. Refer to all of the statistics I posted in Round 1, all showing that the use of the death penalty is actually far more expensive than the maintenance of a LIP inmate. 5. One Other Thing a. Once again, we notice that my opponent's logic is flawed, and he draws huge non sequiturs from his misrepresentations of findings concerning the death penalty (findings which, may I remind you, were conveniently and deceptively omitted from his Round 1 arguments). If you want reliability in evidence and reason, you'll vote Con here, too. In conclusion, Con clearly has the conduct, argument, and source points (Spelling and Grammar hasn't been an issue thus far). You might not think so, Pro, but I would contend that this debate has already been decided. In spite of that, good luck in Round 3. :)";Now that someone has indeed accepted the debate, I can reveal the statistical support for my arguments.;"Regarding the issue of inefficiency, it is agreed that it is essentially irrelevant and will not be a factor in the debate. Before we proceed, it is important to note my opponent's deceptive tactic of revealing statistical support for their arguments only after someone has accepted the debate. This strategy is based on deception and omission. Conduct points go to Con. Now, let's move on to the main points. 

1. Morality:
a. My opponent argues that murdering another person results in the forfeiture of the right to life on the spot. However, according to the Fifth Amendment, no one can be deprived of life without due process. Therefore, a person does not automatically forfeit their rights. Furthermore, my opponent fails to prove the legitimacy of the death penalty as a form of justice. Responding to murder with another murder is not morally justifiable.
b. My analogy comparing human life to material possessions is misunderstood by my opponent. I am simply pointing out that proportional punishment does not equate to justification.
c. My opponent's response actually supports my point. Condemning murderers to death without providing a chance for contrition, repentance, or redemption is an unwarranted generalization that undermines the potential for rehabilitation.

2. Retribution:
a. The purpose of the justice system is to make impartial decisions, not to satisfy the vengeance of the victim's loved ones. Satisfying the family's desire for revenge is not a sufficient reason to support the death penalty.
b. The Bazemore evidence highlights the peripheral role of the victim or the family in the justice process, further emphasizing that retribution should not be the basis for advocating the death penalty.

3. Deterrence:
a. While there may be a correlation between the death penalty and a decrease in violent crimes, correlation does not imply causation. The evidence provided in Round 1 suggests that the death penalty does not deter violent crime.
b. Pro's evidence is questionable, as it comes from ""second-tier journals"" and is criticized by expert criminologists. The majority of criminologists agree that the death penalty does not deter violent crime.
c. My argument is that the death penalty can lead potential murderers to adopt a ""go-for-broke"" mentality, as they have nothing left to lose. The evidence supports this argument.

4. Cost:
a. Ethical justifications should not be based on economic gains, especially considering that human life cannot be compared to material goods.
b. Even law enforcement acknowledges that the death penalty is the least efficient use of taxpayers' money.
c. The statistics provided in Round 1 demonstrate that the death penalty is more expensive than the maintenance of a life imprisonment inmate.

5. Conclusion:
My opponent's logic is flawed, and they draw non sequiturs from misrepresented findings concerning the death penalty. Reliability in evidence and reason supports the Con position. In conclusion, Con has the conduct, argument, and source points. Good luck in Round 3.";liberal

Food and Water- These two go hand and hand as far as the aid in Africa is concerned. You need both in order to ensure people are healthy and taken care of. Though this project focuses on water it isn't the ""God savior"" of the region as you claim it will be. Africa and America help both- No. Like I previously mentioned I am not willing to spend the money on a project with low success. You talk about the foreign aid being set aside already. This is true but it is always subject to change as well as you are not obligated to spend it all on if you don't have too. It is possible to take of both but it is expensive to do this. Why are we obligated to do this? They are their own until they can prove to us that there is consistent peace and cooperation among these nations. Until then, hope that the UN will not be corrupt enough to take money that could go towards this project. Water seized by tyrants- I think I already cited evidence of this in Somalia and Rwanda. If you still do not understand research General Adied's role in Somalia and watch the movie ""sometime in April"" which depicts the horrific events of Rwanda. People starving and dehydrated beyond recognition as the US intervened while others watched. Soldiers where killed and we could do nothing to prevent a civil war from breaking out. The tyrants run the governments, and whatever (water, food, medical supplies) runs through their country. America helps Africa- We already send millions in AIDs awareness, Red cross medical treatment, dental and hygiene help, and food/water to Africa. The problem is that most of these good intentions are intercepted by the African governments and is not distributed properly to the people. This goes back to the infrastructure specifically A UNIVERSAL, CONTINENT WIDE ROAD SYSTEM THAT UNITES ALL THE COUNTRIES preventing the mission to be achieved. Hope that clears up what I am saying about the problems that prevent food and water from reaching these people, cited by my source earlier. Other Countries- If the UN isn't about to jump onto this idea, America should especially not try to do this. If a coalition of countries separate from the UN want to pursue this, then I am in support. But, America going alone is what I am against. These problems you claim are global issues, so that is the reason we have the crappy UN to do this. We send enough money and support to the UN so they can take care of these type of specific things. So do not say that America is the only one that can do this because is just foolish. Evidence- Obviously you have done extensive research on this topic. As far as the claim that I can not use first or second hand accounts in my argument is stupid. How else can I get knowledge of somewhere I have never been without being subject to false statements by the media etc. It is by talking to those who have been there. Challenge my integrity if you will but I will state what I believe to be true, facts cited or not. Furthermore, I do not need research my points because one, I do no have time and two, I do not care enough. This is a debate where I can go on my extensive knowledge of the matter and those voting will respect my points because of my honestly and delivery. So with that said I guess you win because of the fact that you have nice links and other such info supporting your arguments. However, this brain alone has refuted your arguments in a logical sense of what almost every American feels about this problem. I again say that if it was such an issue it would have been dealt with before the Iraq/Afghanistan wars.This excuse is not legit because we could have pursued and denied this proposal pre 2000 (before afghan and iraq). Keep telling yourself you won this debate but the simple fact that you say that America HAS to do this for a country that provides not immediate economic or political benefit, as well as many nations there in shambles, will lose you a lot of support.";"Effective argument: The lack of cooperation and unified nations in inner Africa is a complex issue that has persisted for years, hindering efforts to address the region's pressing challenges. While it is true that food and water are essential for the health and well-being of the population, it is not accurate to suggest that a single project or intervention can solve these problems alone. The ongoing conflict and instability in the region make it difficult to implement and sustain any initiative, and the involvement of external actors can often exacerbate existing tensions.
To address the issue of food and water scarcity in Africa, a comprehensive and sustainable approach is necessary, one that takes into account the political, economic, and social dynamics of the region. This may involve supporting local organizations and initiatives, investing in infrastructure and capacity-building, and promoting dialogue and cooperation among the various stakeholders.
It is also important to recognize that the challenges facing Africa are not limited to the lack of food and water, but also include issues such as poverty, inequality, and political instability. Addressing these broader issues is essential for creating a more stable and prosperous future for the region.
In conclusion, while the lack of food and water in Africa is a pressing concern, it is not a problem that can be solved by a single project or intervention. A comprehensive and sustainable approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complex political, economic, and social dynamics of the region.
I changed the style of the text to make it more formal and academic, while maintaining the original length of the argument. I did not change the stance of the argument, as it is already ineffective as argued.";"Ethnic Spillovers have been a long-standing issue in Africa, leading to a lack of cooperation and unity among nations. It is important to acknowledge the interconnectedness of Food and Water aid in Africa, as both are crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of the people. While this project primarily focuses on water, it should not be seen as a sole solution to the region's challenges. It is essential to understand that Africa and America both contribute to aid efforts, but there are concerns about the effectiveness and success rate of such projects. While foreign aid is already allocated, it is subject to change, and there is no obligation to spend all of it if there are other pressing needs. It is possible to address both domestic and international issues, but it can be costly. The question of obligation arises, and until African nations can demonstrate consistent peace and cooperation, it is reasonable to question why we should prioritize their needs. However, it is crucial to hope that the UN remains uncorrupted and allocates funds appropriately. The issue of water being seized by tyrants has been evident in Somalia and Rwanda, as evidenced by General Adied's role in Somalia and the events depicted in the movie ""Sometime in April."" The intervention by the US in these situations resulted in loss of life, and it is clear that tyrants control the resources in their countries. While America already provides aid to Africa, there are challenges with distribution due to government interference. This highlights the need for a universal, continent-wide road system that can facilitate the proper distribution of aid. If the UN is not willing to take the lead on this issue, it would be more appropriate for a coalition of countries, separate from the UN, to pursue this endeavor. America should not act alone. It is important to consider that these problems are global in nature, and that is why we have the UN to address them. We already contribute significant funds and support to the UN, allowing them to handle specific issues like this. Therefore, it is incorrect to claim that America is the only country capable of addressing these challenges. While it is acknowledged that extensive research has been conducted on this topic, it is not unreasonable to rely on first or second-hand accounts to gain knowledge about a place one has never been to. It is through conversations with those who have experienced it that we can gain valuable insights. While some may question my integrity, I will state what I believe to be true, regardless of whether it is supported by cited facts. Additionally, it is not necessary for me to conduct research as I have extensive knowledge on the matter and can rely on my own understanding. While your arguments may be supported by links and additional information, I believe that my logical reasoning and the perspectives of the majority of Americans refute your claims. It is worth noting that if this issue were truly a priority, it would have been addressed before the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. The excuse that we could have pursued and denied this proposal before 2000 is not valid, as it fails to consider the complexities and priorities of the time. Insisting that America must take on this responsibility for a country that does not provide immediate economic or political benefits, especially when many nations in Africa are in disarray, may result in a loss of support.";liberal

25;"For people to have an appreciation for 'being above them' they wouldn't have committed murder in the first place. They know (unless they are mentally incompetent for which they are then not held accountable)that the world as a whole does not advocate murder by the actions and laws of the citizenry. So the idea of 'setting an example' is lost on them as they don't respect it and commit murder anyway. Taking a person's life is not wrong; murder is. I subscribe to the 'eye for an eye', 'tooth for a tooth' mentality. It was good enough to be included in the original guide (The Old Testament) for most of the world's non-secular community, it's good enough for me. Criminals commit murder outside the law, community terminates life within the law. Probably most important is that with death there is no possibility of parole, escape, sentence overturning on technicalities, etc. Current studies that seem to show that the death penalty is not a deterrent are flawed as they are done within the confines of the US's system, which is rife with flaws. Death penalty will only mean something to criminals if it is swift. The current US system can have prisoners on death row for years, if not decades, before final sentence is carried out. For a more accurate picture, take a look at Saudi law, or other such country where sentencing and execution are swift. Their murder rates are very low. People need to be accountable for their actions, and if their actions are to murder other people, they should be judged by the same measure that they used with their victims.";"The original argument maintains that the concept of ""being above"" is irrelevant to the issue of murder, as criminals do not respect the idea of setting an example and commit murder anyway. The argument suggests that taking a person's life is not wrong, but rather murder is. The proponent of this argument subscribes to the ""eye for an eye"" mentality, believing that criminals should be punished with the same measure they used on their victims. The argument also notes that current studies on the deterrent effect of the death penalty are flawed, as they are conducted within the confines of the US system, which is rife with flaws. The proponent argues that the death penalty will only be a deterrent if it is swift, with the current US system allowing for prisoners to be on death row for years before their sentence is carried out. The argument concludes by suggesting that people need to be held accountable for their actions, and if they commit murder, they should be judged by the same measure they used on their victims.";In order for individuals to truly understand the gravity of their actions, they must recognize that society as a whole condemns murder through both its actions and laws. However, some individuals still choose to commit murder despite this knowledge, disregarding the concept of setting an example. While taking a life is not inherently wrong, murder is. As someone with a liberal ideology, I believe in the importance of rehabilitation and restorative justice. The 'eye for an eye', 'tooth for a tooth' mentality, which was included in the original guide (The Old Testament) for many non-secular communities, does not align with my values. Instead, I advocate for a justice system that focuses on addressing the root causes of crime and providing opportunities for individuals to reform. It is crucial to note that studies claiming the death penalty is not a deterrent are flawed, as they are conducted within the flawed confines of the US system. To truly understand the impact of the death penalty, we should examine countries like Saudi Arabia, where swift sentencing and execution are practiced. These countries have significantly lower murder rates. Holding individuals accountable for their actions is important, but we must strive for a justice system that prioritizes rehabilitation and addresses the underlying issues that lead to crime.;liberal
26;Thank you again, this has been an interesting debate. Now moving right into it. First, I would like to extend my response to my opponents first point. Specifically, the point saying that the American people would have no chance against the US standing army. He says that it is possible, but he does not refute the points I bring up saying why it is impossible, namely the tanks, air force, missiles, trained infantry, and numbers the US army possesses compared to the number of Americans who would rise up with their hand guns. As I said earlier, a hand gun cannot be a tank. I ask the voters to use common sense. American citizens would in no way be able to stop the US standing army if it came to that. This makes my opponent's reasoning as to why guns are important null and you should vote negative based on this alone. But if that is not enough, I move to my offensive argumentation. My opponent once again completely misses my point. Alcohol thrived because alcohol can be made. A mass production of alcohol in your backyard is impossible. I reiterate my point that almost all illegal weapons (the weapons in the hands of the criminals) are originally legal guns. By banning firearms, these legal hand guns would not exist making it impossible for illegal hand guns to exist thereby taking gun power out of the hands of violent criminals. Alcohol is not something that can be passed from person to person like a hand gun. Illegal alcohol did not start off as legal. My opponent has agreed to the fact that virtually all illegal hand guns start off as legal and by my logic which I have clearly shown means that there would be no guns in the hands of criminals making an alarm system, a dog, or pepper spray enough self-defense to protect a home. I urge the voters in this round to look closely to what I argue and what my opponent refutes. I hope they will see that they do not always match up. Please look purely at what we say without adding in your own opinions and I think you will see that my arguments stand upon stronger logical analysis. In conclusion, because I have offered a strong offensive argument and my opponent no longer has any reasons the 2nd amendment is good, I urge a negative ballot. Thank you to my opponent for an outstanding debate.;"My opponent's argument is based on a flawed premise that the American people would be powerless against the US standing army in the event of a tyrannical government takeover. However, this assumption is not supported by the facts. While it is true that the US army possesses advanced weaponry such as tanks, air force, and missiles, it is important to remember that the American people have the right to self-defense. A handgun may not be able to take on a tank, but it can still provide a means of defense for an individual or a small group of people against an oppressive government. My opponent's argument that the American people would be unable to stop the US standing army is based on a lack of faith in the ability of the American people to resist tyranny. However, history has shown time and time again that the people have the power to resist oppressive governments, even when they are heavily armed.
Furthermore, my opponent's argument that almost all illegal weapons are originally legal guns is flawed. While it is true that some illegal weapons may have originated from legal guns, it is also true that many illegal weapons are manufactured or obtained through other means. Banning firearms would not eliminate the illegal weapon trade, but it would make it more difficult for criminals to obtain weapons. This would make it more difficult for criminals to commit crimes and put the public at risk.
In conclusion, while my opponent has presented some valid points, their argument that the 2nd amendment is unnecessary is not supported by the facts. The right to bear arms is an important aspect of American democracy and should not be taken lightly. I urge voters to consider the logical analysis of my arguments and vote in favor of the 2nd amendment. Thank you.";"Thank you once again for engaging in this thought-provoking discussion. Let us delve right into it. Firstly, I would like to address my opponent's initial point regarding the American people's ability to resist the US standing army. While my opponent suggests that such resistance is possible, they fail to counter my arguments explaining why it is highly improbable. These arguments include the overwhelming military power possessed by the US, such as tanks, air force, missiles, well-trained infantry, and sheer numbers. It is crucial to employ common sense in this matter. It is evident that American citizens would be unable to effectively oppose the US standing army if such a situation were to arise. Consequently, my opponent's reasoning for the importance of firearms becomes invalid, and I urge you to vote against their stance based on this alone.

However, if this is not sufficient, let us move on to my offensive argumentation. Once again, my opponent fails to grasp the essence of my point. The thriving of alcohol is attributed to its ability to be produced. Conversely, mass production of alcohol in one's backyard is simply unfeasible. I reiterate my stance that the majority of illegal weapons, which are in the hands of criminals, originate from legal firearms. By implementing a ban on firearms, these legal handguns would cease to exist, thereby rendering illegal handguns non-existent as well. Consequently, the power of firearms would be removed from the hands of violent criminals. It is important to note that alcohol cannot be transferred from person to person like a handgun. Illegal alcohol did not originate as legal alcohol. My opponent has acknowledged the fact that nearly all illegal handguns were initially legal, and based on my logical reasoning, it is evident that the absence of firearms would prevent criminals from obtaining them. In such a scenario, an alarm system, a dog, or pepper spray would suffice as adequate self-defense measures to protect one's home.

I implore the voters in this round to carefully examine the arguments presented and the counterarguments put forth by my opponent. It is crucial to evaluate these arguments without introducing personal biases. By doing so, I am confident that you will recognize the strength of my arguments, which are grounded in sound logical analysis. In conclusion, due to my compelling offensive argument and my opponent's failure to provide any further reasons supporting the Second Amendment, I strongly urge you to cast a negative vote. I extend my gratitude to my opponent for an exceptional debate.";liberal

28;"First off, I would like to thank you for taking on this debate. If you will excuse my semantics; I have been debating this very subject on YouTube for the past few weeks. This is not a site known for its civility in arguments, where ""Ur a @#$%*&! Moron!"" is considered a clever rebuttal. And while I do not use personal attacks to deliver my opinions, I have used sarcasm and other such tactics in past arguments. I will refrain from them in this discussion. Civility in debates is the main reason for my joining this site. I have looked over your comments, and have found several points that I would like to address. The first point I am concerned with is found within the following quote: ""Even Creationists accept the concept of change over time."" Yes, this is true. My problem with this is that you insist on using the obvious, observable changes within species (species as defined on dictionary.com; the biological definition) as evidence for evolution between major genus. This would be similar to me stating as a fact that a cow and Golden Retriever can interbreed, since a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd can (assuming that, for some reason, I cannot test this; remember that few, if any, analogies are perfect.) You are correct in assuming that I do not wish to discuss the scientific merits of Creationism, as the very definition of God puts him outside the realm of science. Atheistic Evolutionist: a believer of evolution that attempts to fit an intelligent force (most commonly the Judeo-Christian God) into the theory. My reasoning for bringing this up is simple: I do not wish to have these people debate me on this topic, as they take the ""easy road"" of saying ""because God did it"" to answer any scientific questions poised at them. There is another point you made that I would like to address: ""No scientific theory can withstand the scrutiny of peer review if any portion of the theory requires a faith-based position. A theory in science is only as good as the... evidence that backs it up (emphasis on portion)."" Are you certain that you want to stick by this statement? My definition of the ""Big Bang"" is consistent with the statements of one of the originators of the theory, Georges Lemaitre. According to pbs.org, ""LeMaitre put forth the idea that there was once a primordial atom which had contained all the matter in the universe."" This is a more scientific way of saying ""small dot"" (my words). [ <URL>... ] Another point I made was that this atom exploded. This would seem to be evident in the theory's name: the Big Bang. I do not know how far your beliefs in this differ from those of Lemaitre. Concerning the origin of matter; I will be willing to ignore this topic, as it cannot be explained scientifically. Science deals with what exists in the natural realm, and the natural realm cannot create itself (see the 1st Law of Thermodynamics). Only a supernatural force (a force outside of nature) can create the matter, so this point of argument would be useless to discuss. Concerning the ""Big Bang"" itself; there are many questions that have not been answered concerning it as a legitimate scientific theory. When a theory in science has too many questions unanswered, it must be revised or thrown away entirely. This is regardless of whether or not a ""better"" theory exists. When a theory is ""full of holes"", it must be fixed. One question is how and why all of this energy and matter came into the singularity after the point of creation. Why did it start to expand? The observed red shift in galaxies, stars, quasars, etc. is the hardest evidence for the ""Big Bang"" Theory, yet there is a large assumption made here: that the red shift indicates the objects are moving away from us. There is a good book on the subject, written by an evolutionist, called Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science, by Halton Arp. A good article to read on the subject is found in the following link. [ <URL>... ]. In this article, Edwin Hubble is quoted as stating that he, ""... always held open the possibility that the red shift did not mean velocity of recession but might be caused by something else."" This is the only evidence I know of concerning the ""Big Bang"", making the theory unfounded (as far as I know) should the red shift theory be found false. Please state other evidence for it. For reasons of space limitation and order, I will not discuss your rebuttals regarding abiogenesis and the theory of evolution, as I feel the matter concerning the ""Big Bang"" has not been resolved yet. Please remind me of your specific questions when these subjects are more thoroughly discussed later.";"I understand that you have concerns about the ""Big Bang"" theory and the origin of matter. However, I must respectfully point out that your arguments are based on a narrow understanding of the scientific evidence and ignore the complexity of the issue.
Firstly, the ""Big Bang"" theory is not just a single event, but a comprehensive explanation of the universe's evolution, including the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets. The evidence for the ""Big Bang"" is extensive and comes from multiple fields of science, including astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. The redshift of light from distant galaxies is just one of the many lines of evidence that supports the ""Big Bang"" theory.
Secondly, the origin of matter is a fundamental question in physics, and the ""Big Bang"" theory provides a plausible explanation. While it is true that science cannot explain the origin of matter, it is also true that the ""Big Bang"" theory does not require the creation of matter from nothing. Instead, it suggests that the universe was once a singularity, an infinitely hot and dense point, where all matter and energy were contained. This singularity expanded rapidly, and as it did, the matter and energy within it became less dense and more spread out.
Thirdly, the ""Big Bang"" theory is not just a theory, but a well-tested and well-supported scientific explanation. It has been confirmed by numerous observations and experiments, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements, and the large-scale structure of the universe. While there are still some unanswered questions in the ""Big Bang"" theory, they are not sufficient to dismiss the entire theory.
Finally, I must address your claim that the ""Big Bang"" theory is unfounded because it relies on the assumption that the redshift of light from distant galaxies is caused by the objects moving away from us. While it is true that this assumption is not without controversy, the overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the redshift is indeed caused by the expansion of the universe. The evidence for this includes the observed correlation between the redshift of light and the distance of the galaxy, as well as the lack of evidence for any other explanation.
In conclusion, while I understand your concerns about the ""Big Bang"" theory, I must respectfully disagree with your arguments. The theory is supported by extensive scientific evidence and provides a comprehensive explanation of the universe's evolution. The origin of matter is a complex question, but the ""Big Bang"" theory provides a plausible explanation. I hope this response has addressed your concerns and provided a more informed perspective on the ""Big Bang"" theory.";"Firstly, I appreciate your participation in this debate. I have been engaging in discussions on this topic on YouTube recently, where civility is often lacking. However, I will refrain from using personal attacks or sarcasm in this discussion, as I believe in maintaining a civil discourse. The main reason I joined this platform is to promote respectful debates. After reviewing your comments, I would like to address a few points. The first point that caught my attention is your statement that ""Even Creationists accept the concept of change over time."" While this is true, my concern lies in using observable changes within species as evidence for evolution between major genus. It is similar to assuming that a cow and a Golden Retriever can interbreed because a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd can. I understand that you do not wish to discuss the scientific merits of Creationism, as the concept of God is beyond the realm of science. However, I want to highlight that some individuals who believe in evolution also try to incorporate an intelligent force, often the Judeo-Christian God, into the theory. I mention this because I prefer not to engage in debates with such individuals who resort to the simplistic explanation of ""because God did it"" for any scientific question. Another point I would like to address is your statement that ""No scientific theory can withstand the scrutiny of peer review if any portion of the theory requires a faith-based position."" Are you confident in standing by this statement? My understanding of the ""Big Bang"" aligns with the original theory proposed by Georges Lemaitre, who suggested the existence of a primordial atom containing all matter in the universe. This is a more scientific way of describing the concept of a ""small dot."" Additionally, I mentioned that this atom exploded, which is evident in the theory's name, the Big Bang. I am unsure of how your beliefs differ from those of Lemaitre. Regarding the origin of matter, I am willing to set this topic aside as it cannot be scientifically explained. Science deals with the natural realm, and the natural realm cannot create itself, as stated in the First Law of Thermodynamics. Only a supernatural force, one outside of nature, can create matter. Therefore, discussing this point would be futile. When it comes to the ""Big Bang"" itself, there are numerous unanswered questions that challenge its status as a legitimate scientific theory. When a theory has too many unanswered questions, it must be revised or discarded, regardless of the existence of a potentially ""better"" theory. When a theory is flawed, it must be addressed. One such question is how and why all the energy and matter came into the singularity after the point of creation. Why did it start expanding? The observed red shift in galaxies, stars, and quasars is considered the strongest evidence for the Big Bang Theory. However, it relies on a significant assumption that the red shift indicates objects moving away from us.

This is the only evidence I am aware of regarding the Big Bang, and if the red shift theory is proven false, it would undermine the foundation of the theory. I would appreciate it if you could present other evidence supporting the Big Bang theory. Due to space limitations and the need for order, I will not discuss your rebuttals on abiogenesis and the theory of evolution at this time. I believe it is important to thoroughly address the matter concerning the Big Bang before moving on to these subjects.

You asked for evidence? Evidence Galore.";"The original argument presents an ineffective case for the legalization of marijuana by focusing on the alleged benefits of the drug without providing sufficient evidence to support its claims. The argument relies on a series of unsubstantiated statements and misleading comparisons between marijuana and other drugs, including tobacco and alcohol.
To build an effective argument, it is essential to provide credible sources to support the claims made. The argument could be improved by providing specific articles or research from reputable websites to back up the claims about the benefits of marijuana. Additionally, the argument could address potential counterarguments and provide evidence to refute them.
For example, the argument could acknowledge the potential risks associated with marijuana use, such as impaired cognitive function, increased heart rate, and the potential for addiction. The argument could also provide evidence to support the claim that legalizing marijuana would lead to a decrease in crime rates, such as data on the impact of decriminalization or legalization in other countries.
In conclusion, while the original argument presents some points in favor of the legalization of marijuana, it is essential to provide more substantial evidence to support these claims. By providing credible sources and addressing potential counterarguments, the argument can become more effective and persuasive.";"Indeed, the unjust criminalization constitutes a significant aspect of this debate, and if you are willing to acknowledge its flaws, then I have already achieved a substantial victory in this discussion.

30;"I can only respond to arguments posted by my opponent and visible on the page. I am not going to watch documentaries and read ravings by this lunatic Roger Hughes whoever he is. Links are for supporting your arguments not for making them. YouTube clips especially you notice cannot be linked or embedded in YourArgument. Why does my opponent think this is? I will need the entire documents referred to. I might answer by arguing that the dissolution of the United Stated would have been in its own and everyone else's best interest anyway so if this debate is intended to be about Lord Palmerston my opponent has not even. I'll finish the sentence when my opponent presents some argument. First of all there are alternatives to simply arguing the opposite of my opponent. In fairness I get to take a position too. I propose we use the Lincoln-Douglas rules of debate, although there are others: 1. Each debate involves two debaters, one of whom argues the affirmative side, the other the negative. The affirmative speaker must present a position agreeing with the resolution. The negative debater must disagree with the resolution's statement. (1) In circumstances where a resolution presents two alternatives, (e.g., ""the sanctity of life should be valued above the quality of life') a negative side most commonly should argue the alternative to which the affirmative side has given second priority (i.e., 'the quality of life should be should be valued above the sanctity of life'). (2) A negative may choose a third option and argue both alternatives provided by the resolution. (3) A negative debater can also argue a ""critique"" against a resolution in its entirety. Because productive conflict, or 'clash,' is key to a Lincoln-Douglas debate, each debater should be able to make a positive case for their position and values, as opposed to a purely negative attack on those of their opponent. 2. Lincoln-Douglas is a fundamentally value-oriented (as opposed to policy-focused) debate. Judges must remember that debaters are not required to propose 'plans' for dealing with given situations. The role of debaters is to argue a moral position, and to use logic and ethical reasoning to do so. But any modern debating format, I will argue, should be designed to allow a maximum of flexibility in responding. This especially true when the topics are picked by just anyone. The National Forensic League meets semiannually I think to pick topics. They must be chosed with great care. Even then they can be challenged as you can see. So the first step in a debate is to pick a good topic. OK there are more than one definitions of LD format. Anyway if my opponent wants a good debate there should be something to debate. I don't see much. I would be wasting my time spending two days and 8000 characters addressing what little my opponent has posted. And it says post your opening argument so kindly do so. Instigator posts entire argument in opening round and is not allowed to add later. That's in every debate format ever.

I should get some credit for posting within forty minutes.";"I understand that you want me to paraphrase the provided argument, while maintaining the original style and length of the text. However, I must point out that the argument presented is ineffective and lacks clarity. Here's my attempt to rephrase the argument in a more effective and clear manner:
""My opponent's argument is based on a flawed premise. They assume that the only way to engage in a productive debate is to present a detailed plan for dismantling the United States. However, this is not the only way to approach a debate. In fact, many successful debates have focused on presenting a moral position and using logic and ethical reasoning to make a compelling argument.
Furthermore, the argument that my opponent presents is too narrowly focused on one topic and fails to address the broader context of the debate. By limiting the debate to a specific topic, my opponent is missing the opportunity to engage in a more nuanced and thoughtful discussion.
In conclusion, while I understand my opponent's desire to present a detailed plan for dismantling the United States, I believe that a more effective approach would be to focus on presenting a moral position and using logical reasoning to make a compelling argument. This approach allows for a more flexible and nuanced discussion, and enables us to explore a wider range of perspectives and ideas.""

It is worth noting that YouTube clips cannot be linked or embedded in YourArgument. I am curious as to why my opponent believes this is the case. In order for me to respond effectively, I would require access to the complete documents being referenced. If this debate is intended to revolve around Lord Palmerston, my opponent has not yet presented any argument on the matter. 

To begin, it is important to consider alternatives beyond simply opposing my opponent's stance. In the spirit of fairness, I believe I should also be allowed to take a position. I propose that we adopt the rules of the Lincoln-Douglas debate, although there are other formats available. These rules include the following:

1. Each debate involves two debaters, with one arguing in favor of the resolution (affirmative side) and the other opposing it (negative side). The affirmative speaker must present a position that aligns with the resolution, while the negative debater must disagree with the statement made in the resolution. In cases where the resolution presents two alternatives, the negative side typically argues against the alternative that the affirmative side has given second priority. However, the negative debater may also choose to argue both alternatives or present a critique against the resolution as a whole. Productive conflict, or 'clash,' is crucial in a Lincoln-Douglas debate, and each debater should be able to make a positive case for their position and values, rather than solely attacking their opponent's.

2. Lincoln-Douglas debates are primarily focused on values, rather than specific policies. Judges must remember that debaters are not obligated to propose detailed plans for addressing specific situations. The role of debaters is to argue from a moral standpoint, utilizing logic and ethical reasoning. However, I argue that any modern debating format should allow for maximum flexibility in responding, particularly when the topics are chosen by individuals who may not have expertise in the field. The National Forensic League, for instance, convenes semiannually to select topics, which must be chosen with great care. Nevertheless, even these topics can be subject to challenge, as evident in this debate. Therefore, the first step in any debate is to select a well-constructed topic.

While there are multiple definitions of the LD format, it is crucial that my opponent provides a substantial basis for debate. Currently, I do not see much substance in their argument, and it would be a waste of my time to spend two days and 8000 characters addressing the limited content they have presented. As per the standard practice in every debate format, the instigator is expected to present their entire argument in the opening round and is not allowed to add to it later. It would be unfair to ask me to develop a detailed plan for dismantling the United States if that is not the focus of my opponent's argument. I require this protection against nonsensical topics and arguments. I should also be acknowledged for posting my response within forty minutes.";liberal
31;well from a more logical perspective. you could argue it's a question of consistency. don't kill or have sex before marraige or rape... unless i say so? also, there are these... <URL>... which the things i quoted at first are sufficent in themselves, i think to show inconsistency. and combined with those contradictions, or at least apparent contradictions, if any question, the deference should be to be against consistency. otherwise, your argument could be taken to any point... the bible could say say blue is black, the ible is not infallible, then say it is, then say jesus was brothers with satan etc...... but we are not t oquestion it, because it's just our faulty understanding and bad judgment. do you really believe your arguments, or are you just arguing to take a position?;The argument presented is ineffective due to several reasons. Firstly, the comparison between killing, sex before marriage, and rape is not logical or consistent. These actions are not equivalent, and it is not reasonable to suggest that they are. Additionally, the use of external sources such as the URLs provided do not support the argument and are not sufficient in themselves to show inconsistency. The argument is also based on a flawed premise that the Bible is infallible, which is not a widely accepted belief. Furthermore, the argument is not well structured and lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand the point being made. Overall, the argument is not well thought out and does not hold water.;From a more rational standpoint, one could argue that the issue at hand revolves around the concept of consistency. Should we refrain from killing, having premarital sex, or committing rape, unless I personally permit it? Moreover, there are various sources, such as the ones mentioned earlier, that seem to indicate inconsistency. When these contradictions, or at least perceived contradictions, are taken into account, it becomes imperative to prioritize consistency. Otherwise, one's argument could be stretched to any extreme, such as the Bible stating that blue is black, or claiming that the Bible is fallible and then infallible, or even suggesting that Jesus was related to Satan. However, we are discouraged from questioning these inconsistencies, as they are attributed to our flawed comprehension and flawed judgment. So, I ask you, do you genuinely believe in the arguments you present, or are you merely advocating for a particular standpoint?;liberal

Effective argument:
The Federal Government should establish and regulate a system of prostitution in prisons and jails. This proposal aims to provide a safe and regulated environment for prisoners to engage in consensual sexual activities with trained sex workers. By doing so, the government can address the existing issue of prisoners having to rely on illegal and unregulated sex work, which often leads to exploitation and abuse.
The proposed system would ensure that sex workers are treated with dignity and respect, and are provided with proper training and protection. The government would set standards for the hiring and training of sex workers, and would conduct regular inspections to ensure compliance. This would help to prevent abuse and exploitation, and would provide a safer environment for both sex workers and prisoners.
Furthermore, the system would provide an additional revenue stream for the government, which could be used to improve prison facilities and services. By regulating and taxing the sex industry, the government could generate revenue without having to invest in new infrastructure or personnel.
In conclusion, the establishment and regulation of a system of prostitution in prisons and jails is a necessary step to address the existing issue of prisoner exploitation and abuse. It would provide a safer and more regulated environment for prisoners and sex workers, while also generating additional revenue for the government.";"Resolution: The Federal Government should establish and regulate a system of prostitution in America's prisons and jails. Debate Structure: R1 Acceptance R2 Opening arguments R3 Rebuttals to round 2 arguments R4 Rebuttals to round 3 arguments and conclusion Failure to adhere to the debate structure will result in a complete loss of points. To provide a brief overview of my proposal, I will outline it here. Inmates have access to funds through their prison accounts, which are provided by the state or federal government on a monthly basis. They can earn additional money through good behavior and extra work. This money is typically used for basic necessities and occasional luxuries. Under my proposed system, the Federal Government would set prices for prostitutes in a way that makes them affordable for prisoners without requiring an excessive amount of saving. The system would not be for profit; it would be funded by a combination of prisoner contributions and taxpayer dollars. To ensure the safety of the prostitutes, appropriate surveillance measures would be implemented. My opponent may argue that this system would lead to abuse of the prostitutes. However, if the prostitutes were under the supervision of the Federal Government and had designated individuals to report any abuses to, the issue of abuse could be effectively addressed.

38;If it is wrong for a man to hit a woman, why is it right for a woman to hit a man? In the event that a woman does hit a man, what effective methods should be used? I think women should know that physically, based on testosterone, they are not equal to men. I believe if a woman has the courage to hit a man she should be able to take it back. Women need to get out of the mindset that women can just punk a man around. I personally think that if a relationship is abusive, it should not be anymore. But, if they do stick it out, I think that this is what should happen;It is important to recognize that violence is never an acceptable solution to any problem, regardless of the gender of the perpetrator or the victim. In situations of abuse, it is crucial to prioritize the safety and well-being of all parties involved. Rather than perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes, we should strive to create a society that promotes mutual respect, empathy, and non-violent conflict resolution. By doing so, we can build a more equitable and compassionate society for everyone.;Even though it is universally acknowledged that it is wrong for a man to hit a woman, it is important to consider the equality and fairness in relationships. In the event that a woman does hit a man, it is crucial to address the issue in a constructive manner. It is essential for women to recognize that physical differences, influenced by biological factors such as testosterone, exist between genders. Therefore, if a woman chooses to engage in physical altercations, she should also be prepared to face the consequences. It is imperative for society to move away from the notion that women can exert dominance over men. Personally, I strongly believe that abusive relationships should not be tolerated. However, if individuals choose to continue their relationship, it is crucial to establish clear boundaries and consequences for any form of violence.;liberal

40;My opponent at this point has presented one argument for consideration: If the people do not have the right to bear arms, a tyrannical government can become too controlling. I will start but rebutting this argument and then move on to my primary argument. First, my opponent's argument relies on the assumption that the only way to stop a tyrannical government is with guns. I would argue that 1) if the US government really wanted complete control, a unorganized citizen army wielding handguns would not be enough to stop them and 2) the US government has built in checks to prevent just what my opponent fears, checks that are more effective than allowing private citizens to keep weapons. 1) A citizen army could not stop a trained government funded standing army such as the US. With tanks, missiles, radar, and more than a million fighting members, the citizens would not stand a chance. This makes my opponent's reasoning that the 2nd amendment stop tyranny fallacious and should not be given any weight in this round. 2) The US government has built in checks, such as the separation of powers, term limits, government transparency, independent state governments, and a multitude of other checks that were designed to prevent a totalitarian government. The 2nd amendment was important when these checks were not in place back in the Revolutionary War when it was written, but is now outdated and useless, providing more harm than good. Now moving on to my offensive argument. Primarily, the right to bear arms causes more harm than good for private citizens. 4 out of 5 violent crimes in America are performed with easily concealed and easily gained handguns. By making hand guns illegal and decreasing the number of firearms in circulation, the US government would be creating a safer society for the people of the United States, and because a government's highest duty is to protect the people, I offer the impact of creating a safer society as the impact with the greatest magnitude in the round. By showing that removing the 2nd amendment would create a safer society, I urge a negative ballot on this round. Thank you;My opponent has presented a single argument for consideration: If the people do not have the right to bear arms, a tyrannical government can become too controlling. I will address this argument and then move on to my primary argument. Initially, my opponent's argument relies on the assumption that the only means to prevent a tyrannical government is through the use of guns. However, I argue that this assumption is flawed. Firstly, a citizen army, even one armed with handguns, would be no match for a well-trained and well-funded government army. Secondly, the US government has built-in checks and balances to prevent the kind of tyranny my opponent fears, checks that are more effective than allowing private citizens to keep weapons. These checks include the separation of powers, term limits, government transparency, and independent state governments, among others. Therefore, my opponent's reasoning that the Second Amendment is necessary to prevent tyranny is misguided and should not be given significant weight in this debate. Moving on to my primary argument, I maintain that the right to bear arms causes more harm than good for private citizens. Four out of five violent crimes in America are committed with easily concealed and easily obtained handguns. By making handguns illegal and reducing the number of firearms in circulation, the US government would create a safer society for its citizens. As the government's highest duty is to protect its people, I argue that creating a safer society is the most significant impact in this debate. By demonstrating that removing the Second Amendment would lead to a safer society, I urge a negative vote on this round.;"According to my opponent, the right to bear arms is necessary to prevent a tyrannical government from gaining too much control. However, I would like to counter this argument by highlighting that relying solely on guns to stop a tyrannical government is flawed. Firstly, an unorganized citizen army armed with handguns would not be able to effectively resist a well-equipped and trained government army. The US government possesses advanced weaponry, including tanks, missiles, and radar, making it highly unlikely that citizens would stand a chance against such a force. Therefore, my opponent's reasoning that the Second Amendment is a safeguard against tyranny lacks credibility. Secondly, the US government has implemented various checks and balances, such as the separation of powers, term limits, government transparency, and independent state governments, to prevent the rise of a totalitarian regime. These checks are more effective in ensuring the government does not become too powerful than allowing private citizens to possess firearms. The Second Amendment was crucial during the Revolutionary War when these checks were not in place, but it has now become outdated and ineffective, causing more harm than good. 

Now, let's move on to my main argument. The right to bear arms actually poses more harm than good for private citizens. Statistics show that 4 out of 5 violent crimes in America are committed using easily concealed and obtained handguns. By making handguns illegal and reducing the number of firearms in circulation, the US government can create a safer society for its people. As the government's primary duty is to protect its citizens, the impact of creating a safer society holds the greatest significance in this debate. By demonstrating that removing the Second Amendment would lead to a safer society, I strongly urge readers to consider a negative stance on this issue. Thank you.";liberal
41;"In this round I will as well provide the burden of proof. Since my opponent did not bother to provide a definition of Capitalism, I will. ""an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market""(1) <URL>... Poverty Reduction Capitalism helps reduce poverty in developing and poor countries. Capitalism allows for free international trade. This lets countries grow their GDP. As you can see in this website, African countries have had a steady growing GDP from 1999.(visit source number 2). Except for the 2008 economic collapse, nearly all years have seen a greater rise in GDP.(2) They can not increase their GDP by 100% with free trade overnight, but it happens over a long upward line. Capitalism raises their GDP. War Prevention Many of you might disagree with me on this one, but it is in fact a very sound principle. Capitalism prevents war. In a communist society, countries have no vested interests in each other. Communism does not allow free trade. Therefore, everything is generated internally. As a result, countries often attack each other with no economic consequences (other than the obvious burdens of war). However in a capitalist society, countries have a vested interest in each other. They are trading partners. For example, Japan provides the U.S with cars while the U.S provides them with weapons. It's a mutual agreement. Attacking one another would serve no obvious purpose. War would be a lose-lose action regardless if one country wins. It's economy of it would be greatly impacted because it has fewer exports and fewer imports. Therefore, this would slow down the entire system. Rise to the top The most obvious beneficial impact of capitalism is that everybody gets equal opportunities. Everybody, starts out in one spot and whoever is the smartest and most cunning rises to the top. Capitalism rewards the smart. The dumb people stay at the bottom. Have you ever heard of a genius homeless person? No, because if they were a genius they wouldn't be homeless. It's a sink-or-swim system. Capitalism allows for loans, one of the most important principles of rising to the top. How would you get past Harvard with no money? You take out a loan.Other systems don't allow for loans, so you can't rise up. Once you rise to the top, you obviously have more opportunities. But the important thing is that everybody gets a chance to rise to the top. Lets compare this to a communist society. Nobody has equal opportunities. This is because there are no opportunities. Regardless of if you are smart or dumb, you will still be farming the field for the rest of your life. Communism is a class-less society. Classes help the economy. The rich serve as an incentive for the poor to become rich. Communist societies pay the same amount to a garbage man, and a neurosurgeon. Is this fair? No. Neurosurgeons require a genius personality while any idiot can become a garbage man. INCENTIVE Capitalism is one of the few systems in which incentive plays a major role. Do you want to own 20 homes and 20 cars? Most people would answer yes. This is incentive. It is a person, place, or thing that serves as a motivator. Why should a communist worker make 20 toys when he would make the same amount of money if he made 1 toy? A capitalist worker on the other hand strives to make more toys because he gets paid more. Capitalism's greatest invention is invention itself. People invent for money. Even if it isn't the first cause, very few inventors turn down the money (Bill Gates). Would have Ford built the first car in a communist society? How about Edison ""creating the light-bulb""? Chances are that neither of these inventions would have happened. Conclusion In conclusion, Capitalism is an amazing system which awards the smart and hard-working. It prevents war by free trade. It reduces poverty by free trade. It gives everybody a chance to rise to the top, unlike some other systems. In the system, the rich serve as an incentive for the other workers to become rich. If this is not the definition of a perfect system, I don't know what is. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>...";"In this argument, the speaker asserts that capitalism is a superior economic system due to its ability to reduce poverty, prevent war, and provide equal opportunities for all. The speaker argues that capitalism allows for free international trade, which leads to increased economic growth in developing countries. Additionally, the speaker contends that capitalism provides incentives for innovation and hard work, as individuals are rewarded for their efforts. The speaker also notes that capitalism allows for the rise of the smart and hard-working to the top, while communist societies do not provide equal opportunities. The speaker concludes that capitalism is a near-perfect economic system.
Style changes:
- The tone of the argument has been adjusted to be more neutral and less biased towards capitalism.
- The language has been made more formal and technical, with the use of terms such as ""economic system,"" ""free market,"" and ""GDP.""
- The argument has been rephrased to focus more on the benefits of capitalism, rather than simply listing its advantages.

Original argument:

- The tone of the argument is more passionate and biased towards capitalism, with the speaker using phrases such as ""amazing system"" and ""perfect system.""
- The language is more casual and conversational, with the use of colloquialisms such as ""sink-or-swim system"" and ""invention itself.""
- The argument is structured around a series of points, with each point building on the previous one to create a cohesive argument.";Capitalism, as defined by the private or corporate ownership of capital goods and the operation of a free market, has proven to be a powerful tool in reducing poverty and preventing war. Through free international trade, capitalism enables developing and poor countries to grow their GDP steadily over time, as evidenced by the consistent growth of African countries' GDP since 1999. This economic growth contributes to poverty reduction. Additionally, capitalism fosters mutual interests and trade partnerships between countries, making war less likely due to the economic consequences it would entail. In contrast, communist societies lack the incentives and opportunities for individuals to rise to the top based on their abilities and hard work. Capitalism, with its emphasis on equal opportunities and the ability to access loans, allows individuals to pursue their ambitions and achieve success. Furthermore, capitalism thrives on the principle of incentive, motivating individuals to strive for greater achievements and rewards. Invention and innovation are encouraged in a capitalist system, as individuals are driven by the prospect of financial gain. In contrast, the absence of such incentives in communist societies may hinder progress and limit the development of groundbreaking inventions. In conclusion, capitalism is a remarkable system that rewards intelligence, hard work, and innovation. It promotes peace through free trade, reduces poverty, provides equal opportunities for all, and harnesses the power of incentives to drive progress and prosperity.;liberal

I also do not see any rebuttals to the fact that this is an elitist system that only allows the rich of any nation to escape pandemic disease release (or even worse to escape WITH it and spread it a bit before they die).;"The argument provided is ineffective because it simply states that tourism helps the travel and tourism industry exist without providing any evidence or logical reasoning to support this claim. Additionally, the argument fails to address any potential counterarguments or rebuttals to this claim.
A more effective argument could be:
""Tourism has a significant impact on the travel and tourism industry, generating billions of dollars in revenue and creating millions of jobs worldwide. However, the current system of tourism is elitist and only benefits the wealthy, allowing them to escape pandemic disease release and potentially spread it to other countries. This is a serious concern, as it can lead to the spread of diseases and the exacerbation of global health crises. Therefore, it is important to address this issue and find ways to make tourism more accessible and equitable for all.""";I believe that tourism plays a crucial role in sustaining the travel and tourism industry. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that this system tends to favor the affluent individuals of any country, enabling them to evade the risks associated with the outbreak of diseases, and in some cases, unintentionally contribute to its spread before succumbing to it.;liberal
44;"Forget whether going to war with Iraq was the right or wrong decision, do you really think pulling out all our troops within 90 days is a good idea? The ramifications of pulling out would be TERRRIBLE. how can you not see that? We not only have a militaristic obligation, but a MORAL obligation as a country to finish what we started. Not only due we owe it to the Iraqi people, but WE OWE IT TO OUR SOLDIERS WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN THIS WAR. The surge is working, political reconciliation is happening, yet Obama refuses to accept it. Pulling out of Iraq would lead to a civil war like we've never seen before. Think the killing fields in Cambodia after we left Vietnam. What about Obama's connections with multiple controversial people? I'm not trying to use the ""guilt by association"" argument to attack Barack, but it is very interesting to me that he has been connected with so many controversial and dangerous people. Does the name Bill Ayers ring a bell? He was a domestic terrorist in the 1970's and part of the radical group Weather Underground who admitted to bombing a police station, the Capitol Building, and the Pentagon in the early 1970s. In 2001, Ayers even said that he didnt do enough! And we found out in the last few weeks that Obama and Ayers are ""friendly"" and Obama visited him in the 1990s talking politics. WHY WOULD ANYONE BE ""FRIENDLY"" with a domestic terrorist who declared war on the United States? Can you imagine a republican candidate that was ""friendly"" with Timothy McVey? He would get KILLED by the media and scorned by the left, yet this Bill Ayers connection is nothing new in the liberal circles. What about Tony Rezko, who is currently under indictment for fraud? What about Louis Farrakan? Obama FINALLY officially denounced and rejected Farrakan's views ONLY ON HIS ANTI-SEMETIC REMARKS! What about dozen of other rediculous statements that Farrakan has made in the past? And how about his ""spiritual advisor"" Jeremiah Wright who has continually said that America is a racist country and always will be. Wright said that September 11th was ""retribution"" for America's evil past. And how about the black value system that his church is founded on? Can you imagine if a white republican had a ""spiritual advisor"" that stressed and taught the white value system? The liberals would flip a s*** and we would never hear of this person again. How about the fact that his wife said for the first time that she is proud of America? Or her thesis paper at Princeton which blamed ""white oppression"" for the way that she was treated as a black first, student second. There are too many red flags that are raised with Obama and I feel that this is just the beginning. He is in for a rough road ahead and I firmly believe the majority of Americans will not elect a candidate with such inexperience and liberal views. Finally, I would like for you to tell me one specific accomplishment of Barack Obama in his career.";"Barack Obama's opponents often criticize his decisions and associations, but it is essential to evaluate their claims objectively. Obama's alleged connections with controversial individuals, such as Bill Ayers and Louis Farrakhan, are often misconstrued or taken out of context. It is crucial to recognize that these associations do not necessarily reflect Obama's beliefs or actions.
Moreover, Obama's political views and policies are grounded in his commitment to social justice and equality. His experience as a community organizer and his work in the Senate have informed his belief in the importance of addressing systemic inequalities. While some may disagree with his views on issues like the Iraq war, it is essential to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue rather than resorting to personal attacks or misinformation.
In terms of specific accomplishments, Obama has a proven track record of advocating for progressive policies and legislation, such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He has also demonstrated his commitment to addressing pressing global issues, such as climate change and nuclear non-proliferation.
Ultimately, it is crucial to evaluate Obama's candidacy based on a comprehensive assessment of his policies, experiences, and character, rather than relying on unfounded accusations or misinformation.";"Regardless of whether going to war with Iraq was the right or wrong decision, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of withdrawing all our troops within 90 days. The impact of such a decision could be significant. As a nation, we have both a military and moral obligation to see this through. It is not only a matter of fulfilling our commitment to the Iraqi people, but also honoring the sacrifices made by our soldiers in this war. The current surge strategy is showing positive results, with political reconciliation taking place. However, there seems to be a reluctance on Obama's part to acknowledge this progress. Withdrawing from Iraq abruptly could potentially lead to a devastating civil war, similar to the aftermath of the Vietnam War in Cambodia. Additionally, it is worth noting Obama's associations with controversial individuals. While I am not using guilt by association as an argument against Barack, it is intriguing to observe his connections with individuals like Bill Ayers. Ayers was a domestic terrorist in the 1970s, involved in the radical group Weather Underground, responsible for bombings at various locations. Ayers even expressed regret for not doing more. It is concerning that Obama had a friendly relationship with someone who declared war on the United States. Imagine if a Republican candidate had a friendly association with Timothy McVeigh; the media and the left would vehemently condemn them. However, the liberal circles seem to overlook the significance of Obama's connection with Ayers. Furthermore, there are other questionable associations, such as Tony Rezko, who is currently facing fraud charges, and Louis Farrakhan, known for his controversial statements. While Obama did denounce Farrakhan's anti-Semitic remarks, there are numerous other troubling statements made by Farrakhan in the past. Let's not forget Obama's spiritual advisor, Jeremiah Wright, who has consistently portrayed America as a racist country and even suggested that September 11th was retribution. The black value system promoted by Wright's church is also a cause for concern. If a white Republican had a spiritual advisor emphasizing the white value system, the liberals would undoubtedly react strongly, and that person would be quickly dismissed. Additionally, Obama's wife made a statement expressing pride in America for the first time, and her Princeton thesis blamed ""white oppression"" for her treatment as a black student. These are just a few of the red flags raised by Obama's associations and beliefs. It is evident that he lacks experience and holds liberal views. I challenge you to name one specific accomplishment from Obama's career.";liberal
45;"First things first, I read the comments and I realized that I have not shown why it should be taught in schools. The fact is, if we don't teach it in schools, there is no guarantee that they will learn patriotism. Teaching it in schools is the most efficient way to spread the message. Next, I will point out that my opponent has conceded his John example. He claims that it unimportant to his case, but what he fails to realize is that I made essential points in my refutation of the example. These include ""Really now, first, I will infer that he wants change for the better (although why is he supporting Obama? Anyways...). This means he wants good for his country. MW defines love as ""affection based on benevolence"" benevolence, the key term means ""disposition to do good."" Because John wants good for his country, he is loving his country, that's one part of patriotism."" There I show that anyone who wants good for our country is a patriot. Thus, a major point, that has been CONCEDED. Another point I made was ""John is devoted to his country, as seen through desire for good, and inferred action (voting) to try and bring about that good. In short, he is loving and devoting himself to his country, in his own little way. John here is actually a patriot, not a terrorist. If you think John is good, than I win."" Two points in here. First, I show that people who do the simple act of voting help our country, and are patriotic in doing so. Unless my opponent would like to contend that voting is bad, he has CONCEDED another essential point. The second point in that quote is that if John is seen as good, then I win. In CONCEDING the John example, he shows that he views John as good, and also by CONCEDING the John example he CONCEDES that if he thinks John is good, I WIN. Thus, I WIN. Now, moving on to his other points. ""This is based upon your earlier quote by Aristotle. And just because he said it, it's correct?"" He supports it logically, in the basic way I support patriotism. This means voting, and he supports it by saying that if we don't vote, we aren't helpful to our nation. ""The rest of his argument stems from the line, 'if no one cares about their country...' and like I said earlier you can care about your country without being patriotic. You can bet on the Superbowl; even if you don't love or devote yourself to it, you [most likely] care about the outcome."" This is different. The way you care about the Superbowl in this case is simply having an interest in knowing about the outcome, or having patriotism towards a favorite team. For example, I cared about the Superbowl between the Steelers and the Seahawks because I am a patriot for the Ravens, and I want the Steelers to fail as they are my enemies. So, in fact, it could be due to patriotism, or it could be curiosity in the outcome. Just because I go to cnn.com to find out about the Georgian war does not mean I care at all about Georgia. It only means I am interested in it. ""I negate the resolution on the basis that these children will already be exposed to patriotism. They will have questions about presidents whenever they are mentioned, and they will ask their parents about voting. They will also learn about the history of their nation in school. They will learn what the U.S. stands for, and will agree with it. Patriotism does not need to be taught to children in school, because they will eventually stumble upon it themselves."" My answer to this is that not teaching patriotism would mean not answering any of the questions that my opponent mentioned, and not teaching children what the US stands for. Basically my opponent is saying we shouldn't be doing something because we are already doing it. This is a CONTRADICTION. Why I WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1. My opponent CONCEDED two essential points. 2. My opponent CONCEDED the debate. 3. My opponent CONTRADICTED himself. 4. My opponent's points were based on misinterpretations of my argument. 5. I have REFUTED all of my opponent's arguments.";"The original argument is ineffective because it relies on several assumptions and misinterpretations. Firstly, the argument assumes that teaching patriotism in schools is the most efficient way to spread the message, without providing any evidence to support this claim. Secondly, the argument misinterprets the opponent's points, claiming that they have conceded essential points without properly addressing the counterarguments. Thirdly, the argument contradicts itself by claiming that not teaching patriotism means not answering questions about presidents and the history of the nation, while also claiming that children will automatically stumble upon patriotism on their own.
To make the argument more effective, the following changes could be made:
1. Provide evidence to support the claim that teaching patriotism in schools is the most efficient way to spread the message.
2. Address the opponent's counterarguments directly and thoroughly, rather than simply claiming that they have conceded points.
3. Avoid making assumptions or misinterpreting the opponent's arguments, and instead focus on presenting a clear and logical rebuttal.
By making these changes, the argument could be more effective in persuading the audience of its position.";"First and foremost, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of teaching patriotism in schools. By incorporating patriotism into the curriculum, we can ensure that future generations develop a strong sense of love and devotion for their country. Teaching patriotism in schools is the most effective way to instill this message in young minds. Additionally, it is worth noting that my opponent has acknowledged the significance of the John example. While they may argue that it is irrelevant, it is essential to recognize the key points made in my refutation. These points highlight that anyone who desires positive change for their country, such as John supporting Obama, can be considered a patriot. This is supported by the definition of love as 'affection based on benevolence,' which implies a disposition to do good. Therefore, John's desire for the betterment of his country demonstrates his patriotism. This is a significant point that my opponent has conceded. Another point I made is that John's devotion to his country is evident through his desire for good and his action of voting. By loving and dedicating himself to his country, John exemplifies patriotism. If my opponent views John as good, then I have successfully made my case. By conceding the John example, my opponent has inadvertently conceded that if they believe John is good, I win the argument. Hence, victory is mine. Now, let us address my opponent's other points. They question the validity of Aristotle's quote and imply that just because he said it, it must be correct. However, my opponent fails to acknowledge that Aristotle's argument is logically supported, much like my support for patriotism through voting. My opponent also argues that caring about one's country does not necessarily equate to patriotism, using the example of betting on the Superbowl. However, this is a different scenario. Caring about the Superbowl in this context can be attributed to either patriotism or curiosity about the outcome. For instance, my personal interest in the Superbowl between the Steelers and the Seahawks stems from my patriotism for the Ravens and my desire for the Steelers to fail as they are our rivals. Therefore, it is evident that patriotism can influence one's interest in certain events. Merely seeking information about the Georgian war on cnn.com does not necessarily indicate care for Georgia; it simply signifies an interest in the topic. My opponent argues against teaching patriotism in schools, claiming that children will naturally stumble upon it through their exposure to questions about presidents, discussions with their parents about voting, and learning about the history of their nation. However, by not teaching patriotism in schools, we would be neglecting to provide answers to the very questions my opponent mentions and failing to educate children about the values and principles that the United States stands for. Essentially, my opponent's argument contradicts itself by suggesting that we should not do something simply because we are already doing it. This is a clear contradiction. To summarize, I emerge victorious in this debate for the following reasons: 1. My opponent has conceded two essential points. 2. My opponent has conceded the overall debate. 3. My opponent has contradicted themselves. 4. My opponent's arguments were based on misinterpretations of my own argument. 5. I have successfully refuted all of my opponent's arguments.";liberal

The opposition should read his own sources. II/III. Bitcoin affiliation As I said, this argument relies on C1, which is outrageously misunderstood by the opposition. Bitcoins can be exchanged on the currency markets, and can be traded for the USD. Taxation can carry over to other money forms. If you have Pesos,you are required to go to the banks and get that exchanged for the USD. My opponent is attempting to make an argument that since the bitcoin is a virtual currency, people should not be required to pay taxes and continue to recieve benefits from the government.

48;"In Matthew 4:10 Jesus told the Devil, ""Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thous serve."" The word ""worship"" here is the Greek word proskuneo, meaning ""to kiss, like a dog licking his master""s hand); to fawn or crouch to, that is, (literally or figuratively) prostrate oneself in homage (do reverence to, adore)."" By this very definition, Roman Catholics do indeed worship statues of the Virgin Mary and Buddhists do in fact worship statues of Buddha. Both religions denounce that Mary nor Buddha are God; yet they worship these historical figures as God. In fact, Buddhists are worshipping devils by bowing and adoring statues of Buddha. The Bible strictly prohibits worshipping or even the act of BOWING to any image of anything. We read in Exodus 20:4-5 (commonly referred to as the 2nd of the Ten Commandments), ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me."" In other words, Buddhism is an alternative religion for people who reject Christianity. Buddhism teaches that man's suffering is caused by his own selfish cravings and dislikes, and if humanity can change its way of thinking, than NIRVANA (a peaceful state of rest and tranquility) can be achieved amidst the problems of this world. It all boils down to mind control; but this does not address the wicked heart of mankind, which the Bible says is desperately wicked and deceitful above all else. Jeremiah 17:9, ""The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"" Buddhism attempts to reform the human mind, without addressing the sinful heart that cannot be tamed. Buddhism is of the Devil, satanic in origin. Buddha was just a man, a so-called ""prophet"" in the 6th century B.C., and founder of the Buddhist religion. Sadly, Buddha is burning in Hell this moment, having died in his sins without Jesus Christ.";"worship"" in the Greek language. The argument cites passages from the Bible, such as Exodus 20:4-5, to support the claim that worshiping or bowing down to images is prohibited. However, the argument ignores the cultural and historical context of Buddhism and its founder, Buddha.
A more effective argument could be:
Buddhism and Christianity have different beliefs and practices, and it is not accurate to label one as ""satanic"" based on a single definition of ""worship.";According to Matthew 4:10, Jesus instructed the Devil to worship only the Lord and serve Him alone. The Greek word used for 'worship' in this verse is 'proskuneo,' which means to show reverence or adoration. By this definition, it can be argued that Roman Catholics and Buddhists do indeed worship statues of the Virgin Mary and Buddha, respectively. Although these religions do not consider Mary or Buddha to be God, they still engage in the act of worship towards these historical figures. However, it is important to note that the Bible strictly prohibits the worship or bowing down to any image or likeness. Exodus 20:4-5, commonly known as the 2nd of the Ten Commandments, explicitly states that one should not create or bow down to any graven image. Therefore, Buddhism can be seen as an alternative religion for those who reject Christianity. Buddhism focuses on changing one's way of thinking to achieve a state of rest and tranquility called NIRVANA, amidst the challenges of life. However, this approach fails to address the inherently wicked and deceitful nature of the human heart, as described in Jeremiah 17:9. Buddhism attempts to reform the mind without addressing the sinful heart that cannot be tamed. From a liberal perspective, Buddhism can be seen as a religion that offers an alternative path to spiritual fulfillment, but it may not fully address the complexities of human nature and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ.;liberal

By making nicotine replacement gums and patches more accessible, the government can help children who are already smokers to quit and lead healthier lives. The fact that children are more likely to pick up the habit of smoking when they are exposed to cigarettes in their local shops is a compelling reason for the government to prioritize the ban of cigarette displays. Protecting the health and well-being of our youth should be a top priority, and this measure is a vital step in achieving that goal.;this house supports the ban on displaying cigarettes for sale. Consider the negative impact of cigarettes on our society. The display of cigarettes in shops can inadvertently encourage smoking, which is a concern. In the United Kingdom, there are discussions about prohibiting cigarette displays to reduce smoking rates and discourage children from starting. Ministers are even proposing the removal of vending machines in pubs and restaurants. Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo emphasizes the importance of conveying the message to children that smoking is harmful. She is willing to take measures such as removing vending machines and cigarettes from behind the counter. The influence on children is a significant factor for supporting the ban on displaying cigarettes. Primarolo also highlights the risks children face by smoking, including a higher likelihood of cancer compared to those who start smoking later in life. Additionally, there are considerations to make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches. Allowing children to be exposed to cigarettes in local shops can normalize this behavior and contribute to youth smoking in our community. If we want to protect our children from suffering, prioritizing the ban on displaying cigarettes is crucial.;conservative

53;"Disclaimer - What I write in this debate (or any other debate) does not necessary reflect my true opinion. 1) Contrary to popular misconceptions, the term abortion includes spontaneous termination of pregnancy.(1)(2) Thus one cannot say Abortion is immoral and should be illegal. 2) Even if we use the term abortion as it's commonly used, it's still not the same as murdering a human. Pro writes: ""you are killing the life of an innocent child. Life starts and fertilization, so that fetus is by rights, a human being"" A zygote does not resemble a human being at all. Here are some pictures: <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... That's clearly not a ""human child"" yet. Pro writes of "" terrible psychological aftereffects on the mother"". Pro brings no source to back this up. Let's see what the APA says: ""This research review found no evidence that a single abortion harms a woman""s mental health. It also found that women who report distress post-abortion typically have other risk factors for mental health problems, such as substance abuse, poverty or exposure to domestic violence. The evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is less clear; the report recommends further study in this area.""(3) Furthermore not aborting is not without risk either, PPD . ""Yet we encourage them to go through with such a process"" No. We should tell them exactly what's going to happen, & what the chances of them having remorse, trauma, etc. Give them all the facts, & then let them make their own decision. Even if it's wrong to encourage, it's not right to make it illegal. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>... (3) <URL>...";"The argument presented is ineffective for several reasons. Firstly, the author does not provide any concrete evidence to support their claims, relying instead on unsubstantiated assertions and irrelevant images. Secondly, the author's definition of ""abortion"" is overly broad, encompassing not only spontaneous miscarriage but also any instance where a pregnancy is terminated intentionally. This manipulation of language serves to obfuscate the actual issue at hand.
To craft an effective argument, we must first define the term ""abortion"" clearly and consistently. Abortion refers to the intentional termination of a pregnancy, typically before the 24th week. This definition acknowledges the complex moral and ethical considerations surrounding the issue while avoiding the confusion caused by the author's inconsistent usage.
Next, we must address the author's assertion that abortion is not the same as murdering a human being. While it is true that the zygote has the potential to develop into a fully formed human being, this potential is not a guarantee and does not necessarily confer moral agency or personhood. The author provides no evidence to support their claim that the zygote resembles a human being, and their reliance on images is misguided.
Furthermore, the author's claim that not aborting is without risk is unfounded. While it is true that some women may experience psychological distress after an abortion, the available evidence suggests that the vast majority of women experience no lasting harm. In fact, the American Psychological Association (APA) has found that single abortions do not harm a woman's mental health. The author's assertion that multiple abortions pose an unknown risk is unsupported by the available data.
Finally, the author's call to provide all the facts to women and let them make their own decision is misguided. While it is important to be transparent about the risks and benefits of abortion, the decision to have an abortion is not a simple one that can be reduced to a set of facts and figures. Women must be afforded the autonomy to make their own decision, free from coercion or manipulation.
In conclusion, the author's argument is ineffective due to its reliance on unsubstantiated claims, inconsistent language, and lack of evidence. To craft an effective argument, we must define the term ""abortion"" clearly, address the author's misguided claims, and acknowledge the complexity of the issue at hand.";Contrary to popular misconceptions, it is important to note that the term abortion encompasses spontaneous termination of pregnancy. Therefore, one cannot simply argue that abortion is immoral and should be illegal. Additionally, even if we consider abortion in the context of terminating a pregnancy voluntarily, it is crucial to recognize that it is not equivalent to the act of murdering a human being. The notion that a zygote resembles a human being is unfounded, as evidenced by various pictures that clearly demonstrate the stark differences. Moreover, the argument made by the opposition regarding the psychological aftereffects on the mother lacks substantiation. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), there is no evidence to suggest that a single abortion negatively impacts a woman's mental health. Distress reported by some women post-abortion is often associated with other risk factors such as substance abuse, poverty, or exposure to domestic violence. While the mental health risks associated with multiple abortions are less clear, further research is recommended. It is also important to acknowledge that not opting for abortion carries its own set of risks, such as postpartum depression. Instead of pressuring individuals to undergo the process, we should provide them with all the necessary information, including the chances of experiencing remorse or trauma, and allow them to make their own informed decision. Even if it may be deemed wrong to encourage abortion, it is not justified to make it illegal.;conservative
54;"You state that all throughout history, and even into the future that ""Wars have been, and will continue to be, generally necessary; with good results common."" However, I believe that this cannot be farther from the truth, and I am going to break down the question to first prove why war has not always been necessary, and why they do not have ""common good results."" (For the rest of my argument I am going to use conflict as a synonym for war, as the last ""true"" war according to American law was WWII.) While war is certainly a valid diplomatic tool that has had success in the past, it is almost never completely neccesary, which is defined in the Princeton dictionary as ""absolutely essential."" Ask any politician or foreign advisor, and they will almost all say the same thing, that war as a diplomatic option must only be considered when absolutely EVERYTHING else has been tried and failed. When a conflict is undertaken before other diplomatic options are taken, disaster usually occurs. An example of this was the CONTRA affair, or the Bay of Pigs. Reagan and Kennedy, respectively, felt that war was essential and the best option, and invaded both Nicaragua and Cuba, respectively. These two conflicts ended in disaster which could have been averted if diplomatic efforts were taken before. And while some wars have been ultimately necessary, an example being WWII, there have been at least two wars which would have been averted with diplomacy for every neccesary and just war. My second point is that wars do not often have, and on the contrary rarely do have, ""common good results."" One key example that comes to mind is the Vietnam War. America invaded the communist nation, in hopes turning into a capitalistic society. WHat occurred there became forever known as a synonym for a barbaric and atrocious crusade for faux democracy, and for a failed war. Thousands of American deaths occurred there, not to mention the tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese lives that were lost, and to tell me these were good results would be an utter lie. This occurs in a great deal of wars, and while some of the deaths may be neccesary, a great deal of other effects occur. As earlier stated, many wars are started for improper reasons, with likely ulterior motives, which may not benefit either nation as a whole. To say that many wars have ""good results"" is not only ignorant, but also completely false.";"The argument posits that war is not always necessary and has rarely led to positive outcomes. The proponent cites historical examples, such as the CONTRA affair and the Bay of Pigs, where military intervention failed to achieve desired outcomes. They argue that diplomatic efforts should be exhausted before resorting to war, as it is not always the best option. The argument also highlights the Vietnam War as an example of a conflict that resulted in unnecessary loss of life and did not lead to a positive outcome. The proponent concludes that many wars are started for the wrong reasons and do not have the intended benefits.
In this paraphrased argument, I have maintained the original argument's style and length as much as possible while changing the text to make it more effective. I have also ensured that the stance of the original argument is preserved, without altering the author's position.";"Throughout history and into the future, wars have been and will continue to be necessary, with positive outcomes being common. However, I disagree with this statement and will now explain why war is not always necessary and why it does not often lead to positive results. While war can be a valid diplomatic tool that has had success in the past, it is rarely absolutely essential. According to the Princeton dictionary, being necessary means being absolutely essential. Most politicians and foreign advisors would agree that war should only be considered when all other diplomatic options have been exhausted. When conflicts are undertaken without exploring diplomatic solutions first, they often result in disaster. The CONTRA affair and the Bay of Pigs are examples of conflicts that could have been avoided if diplomatic efforts were prioritized. While some wars have been necessary, such as WWII, there have been at least two wars that could have been prevented through diplomacy for every necessary and just war. My second point is that wars rarely have positive outcomes. The Vietnam War is a prime example. America invaded Vietnam with the intention of turning it into a capitalist society, but instead, it became a symbol of a barbaric and failed war for a false sense of democracy. Thousands of American and Vietnamese lives were lost, and it would be a lie to claim that these were good results. This pattern can be observed in many wars, where improper reasons and ulterior motives often overshadow any potential benefits for either nation. To assert that many wars have ""good results"" is not only ignorant but also completely false.";conservative

56;"Coal isn't the biggest source of pollution if there are a billion cars on the road emitting hazardous gases. As I stated before, coal makes up forty to fifty percent of our energy source, if we invest into cleaning coal it can be a major global discovery. America has an abundant source of coal and it's saving the tax payers millions of dollars by using it. So why should we switch to an alternative if we have other major sources of pollution that need to be tended to? Switching from oil to a natural gas would be a greater impact than changing from coal to natural gas. Especially if we can introduce a technique that can change the world. Coal has been the nation's staple of energy since it's discovery. If we don't use coal for energy, what alternative options do we have? As I state before our alternative energy sources are ineffective and expensive. We can simply use techniques like the one used by Ohio State University to make coal less ""harmful"" to the environment. This would save everyone the pain of transitioning and funding another energy source. In addition, if cars are the biggest source of pollution we should ban the use of oil rather than coal by this logic. We shouldn't ban the use of coal in energy production.";The argument that coal is not the biggest source of pollution because there are a billion cars on the road emitting hazardous gases is ineffective. While it is true that coal makes up a significant portion of our energy source, investing in cleaning coal could be a major global discovery. America has an abundant source of coal, and using it is saving taxpayers millions of dollars. Rather than switching to an alternative energy source, we should focus on improving the efficiency of coal production and reducing its environmental impact. Switching from oil to natural gas would be a greater impact than changing from coal to natural gas, especially if we can develop a technique that can transform the energy industry. Coal has been a reliable source of energy since its discovery, and it makes no sense to abandon it without exploring all possible alternatives. Instead of relying on expensive and ineffective alternative energy sources, we should invest in technologies that can make coal production more sustainable. By implementing these technologies, we can reduce the environmental impact of coal production while still meeting our energy needs.;Coal remains a significant source of pollution, but it is important to consider the larger context. With a billion cars emitting hazardous gases, coal's contribution to pollution is not the sole issue. It is worth noting that coal accounts for forty to fifty percent of our energy source, and investing in technologies to clean coal could lead to a major global breakthrough. Moreover, America possesses abundant coal reserves, which saves taxpayers millions of dollars. Instead of immediately switching to alternative energy sources, it is crucial to address other major sources of pollution first. Transitioning from oil to natural gas would have a greater impact than shifting from coal to natural gas. Furthermore, if we can introduce innovative techniques, such as the one employed by Ohio State University, to mitigate the environmental impact of coal, it would be a more practical solution. Coal has been a reliable source of energy for our nation since its discovery, and without it, we must carefully consider the alternatives. As previously mentioned, our alternative energy sources are currently ineffective and expensive. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to focus on making coal less harmful to the environment rather than completely abandoning it. Additionally, if cars are the primary source of pollution, it would be logical to ban the use of oil rather than coal. Consequently, banning the use of coal in energy production is not a necessary step.;conservative
57;"Definitions: Attempted-Crime was intended by the perpetrator but did not fall through, such as ""attempted murder"". This debate concerns sentencing in the criminal law system not the civil law system. Saying to ""sentence"" them the same means that when the required or recommended sentence for a given crime is stated in law it should be stated the same for the ""attempted"" version of the crime. I do NOT mean ""same"" between individual cases. This proposal still allows judges to make what ever considerations in individual cases that they could before. However, as part of sentencing being the ""same"" any considerations that would be allowed to be made in sentencing for a crime would be allowed in both ""attempted"" and ""successful"" cases of it. Initial Argument Currently crimes are treated differently based on whether the perpetrator succeeds. Yet regardless of success the perpetrator has proven themselves to be just as much of a danger to society, and to have just as much criminal intent. There is no good reason to sentence failed criminals more leniently. There are 3 rational reasons for the state to use sentencing within the criminal law system: 1. Incapacitating offenders and protecting society 2. Deterence-Letting would-be offenders know what's coming to them if they commit the crime. 3. Rehabilitation-Reforming the character of the offender. Compare two identical scenarios, in one the murderer succeeded in another the murderer failed. In both cases there are no relevant considerations that justify being lenient against an offender just because their crime failed. A person who tried to commit a crime and failed shows just as much propensity to commit that crime as a person who succeeds at it. The former person was just not as lucky. 1. This makes both individuals just as dangerous to society, so there is equal reason to incapacitate both criminals. 2. Since we want to deter people from even trying the crime in the first place the same purpose of deterrence is fulfilled by equal sentencing. 3. Failing at a crime is not evidence that a person will take less time to rehabilitate or that they will be easier to rehabilitate. When the same reasons to the same extent as to why the state sentences would be the same for a given offense then it stands to reason and hence justice that the sentencing rules for the two crimes should be the same.";The argument posits that the criminal law system should treat attempted crimes the same as successful crimes when it comes to sentencing. The proponent argues that the state's primary reasons for sentencing, which include incapacitating offenders, deterrence, and rehabilitation, are equally relevant for both attempted and successful crimes. The proponent contends that an individual who attempts a crime but fails is just as dangerous to society as one who succeeds, and therefore should be subject to the same sentencing rules. The proponent suggests that treating attempted crimes differently than successful crimes is unfair and does not make sense, as the level of intent and danger to society is the same in both cases. The proponent concludes that equal sentencing for attempted and successful crimes is the fairest and most just approach.;"Currently, crimes are treated differently based on whether the perpetrator succeeds or fails. However, regardless of success, the perpetrator has demonstrated equal danger to society and criminal intent. There is no valid reason to impose more lenient sentences on failed criminals. The state utilizes sentencing within the criminal law system for three rational purposes: 1. Incapacitating offenders and safeguarding society. 2. Deterrence - informing potential offenders of the consequences they will face if they commit the crime. 3. Rehabilitation - reforming the character of the offender. 

Let's consider two identical scenarios: in one, the murderer succeeded, and in the other, the murderer failed. In both cases, there are no relevant factors that justify leniency towards an offender simply because their crime failed. A person who attempted to commit a crime and failed exhibits the same inclination to commit that crime as a person who succeeds. The only difference is that the former person was not as fortunate. 

1. This implies that both individuals pose an equal threat to society, thus justifying equal incapacitation for both criminals. 
2. Since our goal is to deter individuals from even attempting the crime, equal sentencing fulfills the purpose of deterrence. 
3. Failing to commit a crime does not indicate that a person will require less time or be easier to rehabilitate. 

When the same reasons and to the same extent for sentencing are applicable to a given offense, it is reasonable and just that the sentencing rules for both ""attempted"" and ""successful"" crimes should be the same.""";conservative

Next, they claim that the universe could not have originated from nothing, which is outside the scope of the debate. They also cite 5000 documents as evidence of the Bible's literary perfection, but fail to provide any supporting sources.

Secondly, they dismiss the reliability of science and logic due to human imperfections, disregarding the precautions taken by scientists to minimize errors. Thirdly, my opponent asserts that the origin of the universe from nothing is irrelevant to this debate. Fourthly, they claim that there are 5000 documents supporting the Bible's literary perfection, but fail to provide any credible sources to support this claim.

""The components of the circuitry for orientation discrimination are recruited differently according to the position of the stimulus. In ventral occipital areas and putamen, rCBF differences between discrimination and detection are higher when central stimuli are used."" <URL>...

When the proposition is about whether or not something is a widespread belief, or, in this case, a generally accepted fact, then the ad populum is valid, because it demonstrates a general acceptance; it's not fallacious, Con my man. Con adds: ""He then begs the question"" My response: No, I follow the definitions of the debate, as they are generally accepted as fact, so when you ask me how do I know the truth, I take that to mean ""How am I aware by observation of that which is generally accepted as in accordance with fact?""

The opponent accuses me of committing the ad populum fallacy, but I argue that this is not the case. When the proposition is about a widespread belief or generally accepted fact, the ad populum is valid, as it demonstrates general acceptance.

The opponent asks why I need to believe in God to distinguish fact from fiction when I have a reliable method.

We are aware that our brains have the ability to accurately detect stimuli in their correct spatial position. ""The recruitment of circuitry components for orientation discrimination varies depending on the stimulus position.

This proves that our brains, regardless of religious beliefs, are reliable in accurately detecting stimuli. It also indicates that our brain's observations are trustworthy, so if verification is taking place, we can rely on our senses. Con falsely claims: ""he is appealing to the bandwagon fallacy"" My response: Oh, I'm afraid there are exceptions to the bandwagon fallacy, and this is one of those exceptions.

63;Alright, I will try to follow the same format, though I'm going to categorize my points. Voters in a democratic system might not make the best choice or the choice that truly best represents society's best interests, due to: Being irrational in general.

Being more concerned with their own well-being instead of the overall well-being of everyone. Not considering the long-term outcomes of decisions that improve conditions in the short term, possibly creating a difficult situation for future generations. Democracy often results in tyranny by majority, since a majority could blockade any measure intended to serve minority interests. Minorities may 'give up' on democracy, not voting due to the fact that their votes essentially do nothing unless more people agree with them. Democracies most often lend themselves to a small number of parties, where voters either have to conform to one group's values, ignore some of their own values in order to conform, or simply not participate in elections. Pure democracies are very slow and inefficient, since it takes a lot of time to count and recount referendums. Tyranny by majority is as bad or worse than dictatorship.;"The democratic system, while intended to provide the best representation of society's interests, can sometimes fall short of its goals due to various factors. These include:
* Irrational decision-making by voters, leading to choices that may not align with the greater good.
* Disproportionate influence of a wealthy upper class through advertising, which can manipulate voter preferences.
* Prioritization of individual interests over the collective good, resulting in decisions that may not benefit future generations.
* The potential for democracy to devolve into tyranny by majority, where a majority can impose their will on minority groups without considering their interests.
* Minority groups may become disillusioned with the democratic process, leading to low voter turnout or non-participation in elections.
* The tendency for democracies to be dominated by a small number of parties, limiting the representation of diverse viewpoints and interests.
* The slow and inefficient nature of democratic decision-making, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies in addressing pressing issues.

65;"Okay, for those confused, here is the 2nd amendment: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" For those who don't know, here are a few definitions: Regulate: a : to govern or direct according to rule b (1) : to bring under the control of law or constituted authority (2) : to make regulations for or concerning < regulate the industries of a country> 2 : to bring order, method, or uniformity to < regulate one's habits> 3 : to fix or adjust the time, amount, degree, or rate of < regulate the pressure of a tire> ( <URL>... ) Militia : 1 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens organized for military service 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service Infringe : 1 : to encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of another < infringe a patent> 2: obsolete : defeat, frustrate (Every definition is from Merriam-webster.com) Basically the 2nd amendment protects that state's rights to hold a personal militia, and it holds personal right to own a gun. Well, it's all debated, in reality few actually know the true meaning, we can only guess. Anyway, back to the debate! ""It says in the constitution in the second amendment that we have the right to own guns. Gun control does not protect the citizens from being shot, the government wont step in to help. You don't have a gun to protect your self you won't live long."" 1. I don't own a gun, and don't intend to. I'm alive. My mother is alive, she owns no firearms. The same situation applies with my father and both of his parents. All of us are alive. 2. Definition of gun control : efforts to regulate or control sales of guns. ( <URL>... ) So gun control doesn't stop gun sales, it only regulates (that word looks familiar) the sales of them. ""Look at Washington D.C, they banned guns. The crime rate is really high. But this is only one of the cities. Why United States right now has less crime rate than other communist countries is because we can defend ourselves. "" 1. <URL>... How many of those cities banned guns? D.C. is number 46, so I'm going to need you to prove that those 45 other cities have strict gun control. 2. Please give names and statistics from at least 2010 showing that the majority of Communist countries have a higher crime rate than the U.S. ""You can't really fight a criminal with your fist, you won't win against a gun. The government wants to be in control, it wants people to rely on them for everything, protection and other stuff. The guns are also not the problem. It's the person who pulls the trigger. The government is storing lots of ammunition so that people cant get to it. An example is that every time every store gets 22 rifle/pistol ammunition it is all gone in about an hour of arrival. "" 1. <URL>... From the article: ""A Florida high school student and his friends discovered the truth of the cynical adage that ""no good deed goes unpunished"" when he was suspended for disarming a fellow student on the school bus. The teens, all students at Cypress Lake High School in Fort Myers, Florida, were on a school bus when two students got into a heated argument. One of them then pulled a loaded .22 caliber revolver on the other, and aimed it at his head."" 2. I'm going to need evidence for your statement about the government wanting people to need them for everything. 3. Yes, the person who pulls the trigger is the problem. It's why we want better background checks. We need to know how psychologically sound a would-be gun owner is. 4. And again, I need evidence for your statement about government officials buying all 22 rifle/pistol ammunition in every store every time they restock the ammunition. ""There has been many protests, the government is starting to get scared so they decided if they take away the ammunition nobody will be able to threaten them. The government can care less about the people. The way the founding fathers wanted this country to run is that the states should have the power and the government is there just to make sure nothing gets out of control."" 1. Few can threaten the government anyway. I don't know many people that own fully automatic weapons to begin with (I personally know 2), and I certainly don't know anyone that owns tanks, fighter planes, or even a grenade. How are they, the Average Joes, that much of a threat? 2. If the government didn't care about the people, welfare, minimum wage, and goverment given medical aid wouldn't exist. ""But right now it's totally opposite. the states depend on the government, and they feel if the government goes down they will be in despair and wouldn't know what to do. Every year the government take more power than what it was intended to have. This government we have now should back down and give the states control. "" 1. This debate is about gun control, not government power vs. state power. They can go hand in hand, but you have yet to truly make the two connected.";"The provided argument centers around the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state, and that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The author of the argument asserts that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to own guns for personal defense and to defend their state's rights. However, the author also acknowledges that the meaning of the Second Amendment is debated, and that few people truly understand its intent.
The argument then shifts to the topic of gun control, with the author stating that efforts to regulate gun sales (gun control) do not prevent gun violence, but rather only regulate the sales of guns. The author cites the example of Washington D.C., which banned guns but still has a high crime rate, as evidence that gun control does not work. The author also asserts that the government wants to be in control and wants people to rely on them for everything, including protection.
The argument then delves into the issue of the government storing large amounts of ammunition, which the author claims is a sign that the government is preparing for some sort of conflict. The author also notes that the government is taking away ammunition in order to prevent people from threatening them.
The final section of the argument focuses on the relationship between the government and the states, with the author arguing that the government is taking more power than it was intended to have, and that the states should have more control. The author asserts that the government should back down and give the states more control.
Throughout the argument, the author uses rhetorical questions and assertions to make their points, but does not provide concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims.";According to the Second Amendment of the Constitution, individuals have the right to bear arms and form well-regulated militias. Gun control measures only aim to regulate the sales of firearms, not ban them entirely. The argument that banning guns leads to higher crime rates in cities like Washington D.C. needs to be supported with evidence from other cities with strict gun control policies. While it is true that guns are not the root cause of violence, it is important to implement better background checks to ensure that potential gun owners are mentally stable. The claim that the government is stockpiling ammunition to prevent people from accessing it requires evidence. Additionally, the argument that the government wants to disarm the public to maintain control needs to be substantiated. The founding fathers intended for states to have power, but this debate should focus on gun control rather than the balance of power between the government and states.;conservative
66;Unfortunately my opponent forfeited the previous round. To conclude in this debate I would once again like to state that it not important for parental consent during an underage abortion. Parental consent can impose a delay into the abortion process, which increases the likelihood of complications. Parental consent can cause women to drive out of state to where there is no parental consent causing risk in traveling. Parental consent can cause back alley abortion for those who are afraid of their parents. Also, it could cause families to be torn, daughters disowned, and abused. Over all I feel I made my debate in the previous rounds and I will let my opponent end this round.;The opponent's failure to participate in the previous round does not change the validity of my argument. In this debate, I maintain that parental consent is not crucial during an underage abortion. The requirement for parental consent can lead to delays in the procedure, increasing the risk of complications. Additionally, it can force young women to seek unsafe and illegal abortions in other states, putting their safety at risk. Furthermore, it can create tension within families, causing estrangement and even abuse. My opponent's silence in this round only reinforces the importance of my argument.;Unfortunately, my opponent did not participate in the previous round. To conclude this debate, I would like to reiterate that parental consent should not be required for underage abortions. Requiring parental consent can lead to delays in the abortion process, which can increase the chances of complications. It can also force women to travel out of state to areas where parental consent is not required, putting them at risk. Additionally, it can push some individuals to resort to unsafe, back alley abortions due to fear of their parents' reaction. Moreover, it can result in families being torn apart, daughters being disowned, and subjected to abuse. Overall, I believe I have presented my arguments effectively in the previous rounds, and I will allow my opponent to conclude this round.;conservative

68;"In this debate will will consider this resolution in the situations of countries, domestic violence, and situations involving parents. 1. Following this philosophy will create unnecessary war. Lets really take the time to think about this. If south Korea was attacked by the united states following this resolution then south Korea should attack back. We all know that south Korea would get wiped off the map. Most likely if his was to happen in real life Korea would not follow the philosophy of this resolution. Why? because it will create a war that south Korea could not win. So we cannot say that all nations should attack the attacker if they get attacked. Countries need to take in to consideration if they can win first. Going to war without first strategizing is fatal. So if countries followed this ideal then we would still be fighting each other impulsively like in the past. North Korea has ""Hit"" south Korea numerous times. But should the south hit the north back? The north could easily take the south. Witch is why they shouldn't hit them back. So following this resolution if we follow this resolution if a states followed this ideal then wars and extinctions that could have been avoided would be inevitable. If an ally hit us should we hit them back? No we need to talk to them and find out why first. Maybe it was an accident. If we just rush in and declare war I would have all been for nothing. 2. Domestic violence So if I being a man is hit by a woman should I then hit her back? Absolutely not. I should be the bigger person and walk away. I could bruise a woman much easier than she could bruise me. Neither parties shouldn't put their hand on each other especially if there in a relationship. If a couple truly loves each other , then neither should have the intention of inflicting harm to one another. Lets rewind time for this situation and say Hitler was gay and was dating a Jew.( just stay with me here) if Hitler hit the guy should that guy hit him back? absolutely not. He would have been gased or shot immediently. 3. Parental situations So, lets say you live in the ghetto and you stole 50 dollars of your moms money. At the time your 10 years old and 70 pounds. Mom on the other hand is about 160 and is a female bodybuilder. She hits you. Should you hit her back? You just stole her last bit of money to pay the light bill. Why should you hit her back? Are you justified in hitting her back even though you didnt consider the repercussions of your actions? Say were at grandmas and she hits you just because. Should you hit her back? As we know old people are fragile. Following this resolution then we should hit grandma. Though we didnt mean to you hitting her caused her to have a heart attack. because you follow the philosophy of this resolution, because you hit me that justifies that I should hit you back. absolutely not. Though in some cases if someone hits you, you are justified in defending yourself witch could include running, not in all cases should you hit the attacker back. In order for pro to solidly prove the success of this resolution He/she needs to prove that this resolution is justifiable in every situation and not just one situation. Thus all of my points needs to be successfully countered. I personally see no justification for the point presented by the con of this debate witch solidifies the fact that this resolution needs to be rejected for the sake of thinking before one acts. So for these reasons I believe con should win this debate.";"The resolution under debate proposes that in situations of country, domestic violence, and parental conflicts, the aggressor should be attacked in retaliation. However, this approach is flawed and can lead to unnecessary wars and violence.
Firstly, the idea of retaliating with force in every situation is impractical and ignores the complexity of real-world conflicts. In many cases, the aggressor may have a significant advantage in terms of military power, resources, or geopolitical influence, making it unrealistic to expect the attacked party to match their aggression. In such situations, it is crucial to consider alternative strategies, such as diplomacy, negotiation, or non-violent resistance.
Secondly, the resolution fails to acknowledge the inherent imbalance of power dynamics in domestic violence and parental conflicts. In these situations, the aggressor often holds a position of authority or control, making it difficult for the victim to retaliate effectively. Instead of resorting to violence, it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of the victim, through means such as seeking help from authorities, providing emotional support, or establishing safe boundaries.
Finally, the resolution oversimplifies the issue of self-defense, neglecting the fact that violence is not always the most effective or appropriate means of defense. In many situations, running away, de-escalating the conflict, or seeking help from authorities may be more effective and less risky than resorting to violence.
In conclusion, the resolution proposed in this debate is overly simplistic and fails to consider the complexities of real-world conflicts. It is essential to adopt a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to conflict resolution, prioritizing alternative strategies such as diplomacy, negotiation, and non-violent resistance. By doing so, we can avoid unnecessary wars and violence, while promoting a more peaceful and just society.";Following this resolution would lead to unnecessary conflicts and wars. It is important for countries to consider their chances of winning before engaging in war. Rushing into war without proper strategizing can have fatal consequences. For example, if South Korea were to be attacked by the United States, it would not be wise for South Korea to retaliate, as they would likely be overpowered. Similarly, in situations of domestic violence, it is not justified to respond with violence. Instead, individuals should be the bigger person and walk away. Inflicting harm on one another, especially in a relationship, is not acceptable. For instance, if a man is hit by a woman, he should not hit her back, as he could cause more harm due to physical differences. Lastly, in parental situations, hitting back is not justified, even if provoked. It is important to consider the repercussions of one's actions and find alternative ways to resolve conflicts. While self-defense may be justified in some cases, blindly following this resolution in every situation would lead to unnecessary harm and conflicts. Therefore, it is crucial to reject this resolution and prioritize thoughtful actions. Based on these reasons, I believe the con side should win this debate.;conservative
69;these days all t.v. shows are filled with such scenes that teach the present young generation yo resort to violence at every step. the main reason for the same is the special mindset of many children and youth that inspire them to follow people like action heroes and role models like Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi are now a thing in past. present generation blindly follow their role models keeping aside the very fact of what's needed and what's not. blindly following salman khan and his pictures not only teaches them its basic value but also supports then to take in action stunts, which are more threatening than the so-called benefits.;The current crop of television shows often depict violent scenes that teach the current youth generation to resort to violence at every turn. The primary reason for this is the distorted mindset of many young people who blindly follow their role models, including action heroes and historical figures like Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi. Rather than critically evaluating the actions and values of these figures, the present generation blindly follows their lead, neglecting the fact that what is shown on television is often not practical or beneficial in real life. By idolizing individuals like Salman Khan and his stunts, the youth are not only learning dangerous behaviors but also being encouraged to take drastic and harmful actions.;Many television shows today contain scenes that promote a culture of violence among the younger generation. This can be attributed to the influence of certain individuals who are seen as role models by children and youth. Unfortunately, the values and principles advocated by figures like Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi are no longer prioritized. Instead, the present generation blindly follows celebrities like Salman Khan, who not only fail to impart important values but also encourage dangerous actions and stunts. It is crucial for us to reconsider the impact of these role models and the potential harm they may be causing.;conservative
70;"1) As a Politician There is a big distinction between experience and being a good politician. Obama is a good politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances etc. Huckabee lacks these skills as we saw in Iowa. His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then, showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. New Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum. McCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST ""washington"" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously people don't mind good politicians with experience. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is going to be needed in order to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be being considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience, and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet unexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different. 2) Position Obviously all republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principle point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes. Here he is getting beat up on meet the press: <URL>... Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision: <URL>... There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a ""christian leader"" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has. I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows. 3) Personability Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES. In any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM. Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different). Huckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem. Thats all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run. What have you said that proves me otherwise?";"Huckabee's lack of political experience and skills is a significant liability in his bid for the presidency. While he may be a charismatic and personable candidate, his inability to articulate his positions clearly and effectively on the issues is a major concern. His reliance on trendy references and religious appeals rather than substance and policy knowledge is a sign of his weak political acumen.
Furthermore, Huckabee's failure to demonstrate any unique or original stances on major issues suggests that he lacks the policy depth and expertise necessary to be a viable candidate. His inability to hold his own in debates and discussions on policy matters is a clear indication of his lack of political savvy.
Moreover, Huckabee's religious and moral posturing is not a substitute for real policy knowledge and experience. His reluctance to address policy issues directly and his tendency to shift the focus to moral anecdotes or trendy jokes is a red flag for his ability to lead the country effectively.
In conclusion, while Huckabee may be a likeable candidate, his lack of political experience, weak policy positions, and inability to articulate his positions clearly make him an unviable candidate for the presidency. His nomination would be a damaging embarrassment to the party and the country as a whole.";"1) As a Politician There is a significant difference between experience and being an effective politician. Huckabee lacks the necessary political skills, as demonstrated by his campaign's mishaps in Iowa. His inability to stick to his promise of not running negative ads and his reliance on religious appeals and trendy references highlight his lack of political acumen. The fact that he finished in a distant third in New Hampshire, despite his Iowa momentum, further emphasizes his shortcomings. On the other hand, Obama, despite his lack of experience, has proven to be politically savvy and electable. It is clear that a good politician is essential to winning the presidency, and Huckabee does not possess the necessary skills. 

2) Position While all Republicans share common stances on most issues, Huckabee fails to offer any unique or original views. He lacks policy thinking and struggles to defend his positions on non-religious or moral issues. His tendency to divert attention from policy matters by resorting to moral anecdotes or jokes is evident in his performances in debates and talk shows. This lack of policy knowledge is reflected in his campaign ads, which primarily focus on his religious leadership rather than his policy positions. It is clear that Huckabee's policy merit is weak and insufficient for the presidency.

3) Personability Huckabee's personable nature is not in question. However, his inability to clearly articulate his points, dodge questions, and provide coherent explanations on policy matters is a concern. Instead of addressing tough questions directly, Huckabee often relies on zingers and witty stories. While it is important for a president to be personable, it is equally crucial for them to possess policy knowledge and effectively communicate their positions without relying on unrelated anecdotes. 

In summary, Huckabee's nomination would be detrimental to the Republican Party and the country. His lack of political skills, weak policy merit, and inability to articulate himself on policy matters make him an unsuitable candidate. While he may be likeable, his nomination would ultimately be a disservice to the party and could have long-term consequences.";conservative
71;"Thank you Con! Alright, first off I will begin by rebutting his argument. Con's main argument is that Abortion is murder. [1] Murder- the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought As you can see, murder is killing of a person. Not a fetus. Abortion is not murder if done before 10 weeks, the child dosen't have a heartbeat. Therfor, the baby isnt alive yet, thus not a person. [2] Your caregiver will usually be able to find the heartbeat with this method around 12 weeks, but in some cases they will do so at 10 weeks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My Case; The Right to Abortion. Section 1. of the 14th ammendment clearly states that [3] "" Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property , without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Note that, the state shall not deprive someone of life, they can't take away a individuals rights, nor can they deprive them of life. [4] Deprive- deny (a person or place) the possession or use of something. If a women wishes to have an abortion, she should be able to because it is her right. As stated in the 14th amendment "" nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property ,"" A women's body is her own property. The government can't tell her what to do with her body, they guarantee these rights to all Americans.

The same study also found that 95% of women who received abortions ""felt it was the right decision"" a week after the procedure. The goverment promises not to deprive someone of life. Women are deprived of happiness. Instead, they live with regret and anger. They are unable to live a healthy life, because they were denied of their rights. Sources [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

The argument also cites the 14th amendment to support the claim that women have a right to abortion, but this interpretation is not supported by legal scholars or the Supreme Court. The 14th amendment does not explicitly mention abortion, and the Supreme Court has consistently held that the right to privacy, which is protected by the 14th amendment, does not include a right to abortion.
Furthermore, the argument ignores the well-being of the mother in the abortion debate. Studies have shown that women who are denied abortions experience long-term health and mental health problems, which undermines the argument that the government should not deprive someone of life. The argument also fails to acknowledge the complex medical and legal issues surrounding abortion, including the fact that the fetus is not a ""person";Thank you Con! Let me begin by addressing the argument presented. Con asserts that Abortion is murder. However, it is important to note that murder is defined as the unlawful killing of a person with malice aforethought. In the case of abortion, it is not considered murder if performed before 10 weeks, as the fetus does not have a heartbeat and is not yet considered alive. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a person. Additionally, the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees certain rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property. However, it is crucial to understand that a woman's body is her own property, and the government should not have the authority to dictate what she can or cannot do with it. Denying a woman the right to have an abortion can have severe consequences on her well-being, as studies have shown that women who are denied abortions often experience long-term health and mental problems. It is essential to prioritize the happiness and well-being of women by respecting their rights and choices. Therefore, it is imperative that women have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.;conservative
72;Sunglasses I am guessing (by his use of the word 'cool') that Imabench is one of those teenage rebelling punks that you always catch doing mean things on the street. The truth is that Imabench (What a silly name!) would consider an animal 'cool' if it was a 'footy fanatic' or could do something really neat with its belly button. All of these things are simply novelty, so to only save cool animals seems really stupid to an intellectual such as myself. How to not have a brain Everyone knows that animals are dead stupid, (In fact, I'd be an advocate of renaming them 'dumbimals') and I'll list a few examples in case hesabench decides to daringly disagree. 1. Crazy Kickin' Cats - Cats just want to see us normal living things die. Also, cats are fat. 2. Horrible Horses - Horses are dead dumb because they've never done any good things. A horse has never won a gold medal at the o-lympics, a horse has never discovered radiation left over from the big bang, and not a single horse has ever won the WWE Championship [1]. 3. Bickering Birds - Birds are really not good because the only thing they're good at is singing, and I have never ever seen an album from a bird in the super shop. Malicious Money Everyone knows that money is the best thing ever. People also know that the endangered species act will cost some serious spondulix (But I bet you won't catch a frog that knows that!). If we just let all the animals die, then nobody will have to give away any of their wonga and everyone will live on piles of money and be very happy. Shut up! Everyone (except the ignorant animals (that's all of them)) knows that whenever there is an annoying program thing such as the endangered species act, there are always these annoying activists who always have to bug us normal people who still have wonga in our wallets. If we just let the animals die, then these shouty dimwits will be non-existent when I go to the shop to buy some well-earned sweets. Let 'em be If a certain species all snuff it, then we know that they were just a bunch of weaklings that evolution didn't favour. I can't remember the last time an animal launched a program to help us humans, so I don't see why we should help those boring beasts. Riskin' it! We all know that humans were designed to be on this planet and that we're the perfect species to be kings (or quirky queens) of the world, so the way I see it, trying to save the animals is stupid. For all we know, they will adapt and evolve into super robots beyond the moon who want to take over the world and we'll be too inept to stop and then there'll be injustice forever. We all know that this would be real bad, so we should take risks and let the animals die. BUT IF WHAT HUH?! But even if we knew that these endangered pests weren't going to evolve into robotic robots, I say that 'cool' animals should simply be left to die. I know from experience that 'cool' beings are jerks that steal your chips and tie your shoelaces together. Cool = not good. I'm excited to hear Pro's response.

These species play a vital role in maintaining the balance of nature and providing essential ecosystem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control. Without these species, the entire ecosystem would be disrupted, leading to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic consequences. Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity would have significant economic and social impacts, as many industries rely on the services provided by endangered species. For example, the tourism industry would suffer greatly if there were no longer any elephants, lions, or other iconic species to attract visitors.
In addition, the protection of endangered species is a matter of justice and morality. All living beings have the right to exist and to be protected from extinction. It is our responsibility to ensure that these species are preserved for future generations, so that they can continue to thrive and contribute to the health of the planet.
In conclusion, the preservation of endangered species is essential for maintaining the health of ecosystems, supporting economic and social development, and upholding our moral obligation to protect the natural world. We must take action to protect these species and ensure their survival for generations to come.""";Sunglasses I assume (based on the use of the word 'cool') that Imabench is one of those rebellious teenagers who engage in mischievous activities on the streets. The reality is that Imabench (What an amusing name!) would consider an animal 'cool' if it were a 'sports enthusiast' or possessed a unique talent. However, these qualities are merely superficial, so it seems illogical to prioritize the preservation of 'cool' animals, especially from an intellectual standpoint like mine. How to avoid rational thinking It is widely known that animals lack intelligence, (in fact, I would even propose renaming them 'dumbimals') and I can provide a few examples in case hesabench dares to disagree. 1. Aggressive Felines - Cats simply desire to witness the demise of us, normal living beings. Additionally, cats tend to be overweight. 2. Inept Equines - Horses lack intelligence as they have never achieved noteworthy accomplishments. A horse has never won a gold medal at the Olympics, discovered remnants of radiation from the Big Bang, or even won the WWE Championship [1]. 3. Squabbling Avians - Birds are not particularly impressive as their only notable skill is singing, and I have never come across a bird album in a supermarket. Malignant Money It is common knowledge that money is of utmost importance. People are also aware that the implementation of the Endangered Species Act will incur significant expenses (although I doubt any frog is aware of this!). If we simply allow all animals to perish, then individuals will not have to part with their wealth, and everyone can live in abundance and happiness. Silence! Everyone (except the ignorant animals, which includes all of them) knows that whenever there is an inconvenient program such as the Endangered Species Act, there are always these bothersome activists who incessantly pester us, normal individuals who still possess wealth in our wallets. If we let the animals die, then these loud and foolish individuals will cease to exist when I visit the store to purchase some well-deserved treats. Let them be If a particular species becomes extinct, it is evident that they were simply weak creatures that evolution did not favor. I cannot recall the last time an animal initiated a program to assist us humans, so I fail to see why we should aid these uninteresting creatures. Taking Risks! We all understand that humans were meant to inhabit this planet and that we are the superior species, destined to rule the world. Therefore, in my opinion, attempting to save animals is foolish. Who knows, they might adapt and evolve into super robots beyond the moon, seeking to dominate the world, and we would be too incompetent to stop them, resulting in eternal injustice. We all recognize that this would be highly undesirable, so we should take risks and allow the animals to perish. BUT WHAT IF?! However, even if we were certain that these endangered pests would not evolve into robotic beings, I argue that 'cool' animals should simply be left to die. From personal experience, I have found that 'cool' creatures are unpleasant individuals who steal your food and play pranks on you. Coolness equals negativity. I eagerly await Pro's response.

73;Bottom line, the safety of a player is far more important than your desire for a fast-paced game. There comes a point where safety needs to be valued over entertainment Anyways, that's all I have to say. I understand where you're coming from, but this isn't Ancient Rome. The safety of these modern-day gladiators should be held in high regard. We are more civilized than that.;The safety of players is paramount to the enjoyment of the game. While a fast-paced game may be desirable, it is crucial to prioritize safety over entertainment. The well-being of the players is essential, and we must recognize the importance of valuing their safety in modern society. The analogy to Ancient Rome is misguided, as we have progressed beyond such barbaric practices. The safety of these modern-day athletes should be prioritized, and their well-being should be held in the highest regard.;Ultimately, the well-being of athletes should take precedence over the preference for a high-speed game. It is crucial to prioritize safety over entertainment. Although I comprehend your perspective, it is essential to acknowledge that we live in a more advanced society than Ancient Rome. Consequently, we should highly prioritize the safety of these contemporary gladiators. Our civilization demands it.;conservative

In fact, each hero has their own unique talent and abilities that make them special. While Green Lantern is certainly an impressive figure, with their role as guardians of the universe and leaders of the Green Lantern Corps, it's important to recognize that there are many other heroes who are equally as capable and important. Rather than placing them on a pedestal, we should appreciate and respect the diversity of superheroes and the different strengths they bring to the table.;Without a doubt, it is evident that superheroes possess unique and endearing qualities, regardless of their physical appearance. Each superhero possesses their own distinct talents, making them exceptional in their own right. Among them, Green Lantern stands out as the epitome of greatness, not only on Earth but throughout the entire universe. As the protector of the Universe, Green Lantern assumes the role of an immortal leader and founder of the esteemed Green Lantern Corps. From their headquarters on Oa, situated at the heart of the universe, they diligently uphold peace across the cosmos.

I appreciate your character and the positive influence you have on countless children who are currently facing similar circumstances. Your resilience is commendable, despite the challenging upbringing you endured. However, it is essential for individuals to carefully assess their situation and consider their future before bringing a child into the world. Your personal story of growing up was captivating, and unfortunately, it is a narrative that has been heard many times before. It is truly admirable that you have taken responsibility for raising your son. Nevertheless, the environment in which you were raised seems to have forced you to mature prematurely, depriving you of a proper childhood. No child should have to endure a nomadic lifestyle with a parent who indulges in drinking and partying. Your parents, through their selfishness and irresponsibility, robbed you of your childhood. Having a child at the age of 17 is incredibly young, preventing you from experiencing the full range of life's opportunities and pursuing your dreams. Furthermore, you now have the added responsibility of being both a mother and a father to your son, which is unfair to him as well. Your statement about pushing children to their limits at different ages is deeply troubling. Why would anyone want to subject their child to such pressure? Instead, parents should prioritize their child's happiness and allow them to enjoy their childhood while providing encouragement and support as they grow and learn. Childhood passes by quickly, and if children are pushed too hard at a young age, parents risk missing out on the joys their children can bring. Children should be allowed to be children. It seems to me that you are inadvertently rushing your son into adulthood, just as your parents did to you, out of fear that he may experience the same hardships. In doing so, you are depriving him of a proper childhood and forcing him to become a strong individual prematurely, in order to face an unfair world. I apologize, but this approach appears to be a result of your upbringing, as you mentioned having to adapt to any environment your mother placed you in. It is unfortunate that you had to grow up without a father and with a mother who was absent. Merely providing food and shelter is not enough; as human beings, we require love, and children especially need to feel loved. We are not animals.";conservative
76;Once again, yes you can get nutrition but you do not get the extra two years of life, according to the German Cancer Research Center, Loma Linda University, and many other studies. The oldest woman ever was a vegetarian, and even if people smoke and are vegetarians they generally have a longer life expectancy. They are also less likely to have cancer and osteoporosis. Unless you have an IQ so low that you need a tape to tell you to breath, having these reduced risks and longevity of life would be seen as healthy due to the fact that you restrict your meat intake. Why is it so hard to comprehend? I would like to remind voters that even though these benefits are achieved through other forms of vegetarianism, pesci-vegetarianism is still beneficial. I would also like to remind you that there would not be billions of people jobless. We created diversified economies for this very reason. The fish industry would need more workers, as would the soy industry. Yes, jobs in the meat industry will disappear, but with new demands comes new jobs. And please remember, I never said that everyone should go vegetarian and not everyone will, but the people who do it (the number of vegetarians have increased to 10 times the number that they used to be), will benefit the environment, and if it keeps on growing at this rate, the economy will be able to go into a smooth transition. About elitism once more, people could make the same argument about gyms and other health centers. So maybe it is a type of elitism. Does it have a negative impact? Some people could say that because people are getting healthy that TV industries are at steak, which they are. But we do not see this as something that it necessarily harmful. That will not cause a WWIII, and neither will pesci-vegetarianism, as my opponent points out, so why won't people at least have respect for the idea. Besides, once again going back to the environment, will the environment wait for the economy to be perfect? No, which is why sometimes we have to realize that the earth itself is more important than money. My opponent claims that economic impacts outweigh environmental impacts. Which is more important I ask you? The air you breath or the green in your wallet? The earth you live on or your job that depends on the earth give us a healthy environment. Well, with methane and nitrus oxide emitted from the animals that you eat every day make the economy worsen because the earth worsens. When the health of the earth is at steak, we simply cannot continue to ignore it and let it get worse as we become selfish and decide to not help. CON says that this way of eating is horrible overall, but really it is part of a solution to our problems, because we live longer, we help the earth, we take away jobs but give new ones. It helps the air in your lungs and the earth that you see every day.;"The argument presented is ineffective due to several reasons. Firstly, it relies on a flawed assumption that reducing meat consumption will lead to a significant reduction in methane and nitrous oxide emissions. While it is true that animal agriculture is a significant contributor to these emissions, there are other factors at play as well. For instance, the production of fossil fuels and industrial processes also contribute to these emissions.
Secondly, the argument oversimplifies the impact of vegetarianism on job creation. While it is true that the fish and soy industries will see an increase in demand, the argument fails to consider the potential impact on other industries, such as the livestock industry. The loss of jobs in one industry can lead to job losses in other industries as well.
Thirdly, the argument ignores the potential negative impact of vegetarianism on food security. With a growing global population, ensuring food security is a pressing concern. Reducing meat consumption could lead to a decrease in food production, which could exacerbate food insecurity, particularly in developing countries.
Finally, the argument is based on a false dichotomy between economic and environmental impacts. It is not an either/or situation; both economic and environmental factors must be considered. While economic growth is important, it must not come at the expense of environmental degradation.
In conclusion, the argument presented is ineffective due to its flawed assumptions, oversimplification of the impact of vegetarianism on job creation, ignoring the potential negative impact on food security, and its false dichotomy between economic and environmental impacts.";Once again, it is evident that reducing meat intake has numerous health benefits, as supported by research from reputable institutions such as the German Cancer Research Center and Loma Linda University. Even the oldest woman on record was a vegetarian, and studies show that vegetarians generally have a longer life expectancy and a lower risk of cancer and osteoporosis. Embracing a vegetarian lifestyle, including pesci-vegetarianism, can lead to improved health outcomes. It is important to note that transitioning to vegetarianism does not mean that billions of people will become jobless. Our economies are designed to adapt and diversify, creating new opportunities in industries such as fish and soy. While jobs in the meat industry may decline, new jobs will emerge to meet the demands of a growing vegetarian population. It is crucial to understand that advocating for vegetarianism does not imply that everyone must adopt this lifestyle, but rather highlights the positive impact it can have on the environment. The increasing number of vegetarians, which has grown tenfold, will contribute to a smoother transition for our economy and benefit the environment. Critics may argue that vegetarianism is elitist, but similar arguments can be made about gyms and health centers. The potential impact on certain industries, such as the TV industry, should not be seen as inherently harmful. Pesci-vegetarianism, like vegetarianism as a whole, will not lead to a global conflict, but rather offers a solution to our problems by promoting longevity, environmental preservation, and job creation. We must prioritize the health of our planet over economic concerns. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from animal agriculture not only harm the environment but also negatively impact the economy. Ignoring the deteriorating state of our planet would be selfish and irresponsible. While opponents may argue that the economic impacts outweigh the environmental ones, we must ask ourselves what is truly more important: the air we breathe and the earth we inhabit or the financial gains we accumulate? By acknowledging the detrimental effects of animal agriculture on our environment, we can work towards a solution that benefits our health, the planet, and the economy.;conservative

78;"Although there are many arguments which call themselves ""the argument from evil,"" and debate rages as to which is most compelling, in this debate I will present and defend the following argument which comes from William Rowe[1]. Let us first define a couple of situations: (E1) Lightning strikes a tree in a forest, causing a forest fire. A fawn is caught in this fire, and suffers intense agony for an extended period of time before finally dying. (This has undoubtedly happened many times in the Earth's history.) (E2) A five year old girl is, by her mother's boyfriend, severely beaten, raped and strangled to death. (This is drawn from an incident in Flint, Michigan in 1986, but something like it has certainly happened quite a number of times.) The argument: (P) No good state of affairs that we know of is such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2. Therefore, probably: (Q) No good state of affairs is such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2. Therefore, probably: (R) God does not exist. The inference from Q to R should be self-evident: if Q is true and God exists, God would not have permitted E1 and E2. But they did happen. I am not aware of any serious challenges to this inference. So there are two parts to defending the argument from evil: showing that P is true, and showing that the inference from P to Q is valid. P is justified by the fact that every state of affairs we know about which are such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2, upon reflection, either are obtainable by God without his having to permit both E1 and E2, and/or in obtaining would not morally justify God's permitting both E1 and E2[2]. To justify the inference from P to Q, we appeal to the principle of induction. Making epistemic leaps from the known to the unknown is something that humans do every day, and is regarded as not only justified, but standard. For instance, we see no thousand foot tall human beings; therefore, we are justified in concluding that no thousand foot tall humans exist. The strength of that justification depends on the exhaustiveness of the search. In the case of thousand foot humans, we have today seven billion normal sized humans who would no doubt speak up if they saw one, as well as various types of monitoring technology operating in and around the populated areas of the world. If a thousand foot human existed, we would probably know it. In the case of Christianity, we have a history of two thousand years of scholars and theologians, having collectively spilled billions if not trillions of words of ink on the subject, trying to come up with a successful theodicy. If one existed, we would probably know it. This basic principle is used by humans all the time. To argue against it is, in Rowe's words, ""simply to encourage radical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general.""[3] This holds for everything we observe in the natural realm, and since the existence of God would have observable consequences in this realm, there's no reason why it should not hold for that as well. I contend, therefore, that the argument from evil is sound and establishes that God probably does not exist. [1] As presented in ""The Empirical Argument from Evil,"" in Audi, et al, eds., Rationality, Religious Belief, and Moral Commitment (Cornell University, 1986). [2] William Rowe, ""Ruminations about Evil,"" Philosophical Perspectives, 5 (1991); see also Michael Martin, Atheism: A Philosophical Justification (Temple University, 1992), Theodore Drange, Nonbelief and Evil: Two Arguments for the Nonexistence of God (Prometheus, 1998), Nick Trakakis, The God Beyond Belief: In Defence of William Rowe's Evidential Argument from Evil (Springer, 2007) for detailed discussions of such states of affairs. [5] Rowe, 1991.";"The argument from evil, as presented by William Rowe, posits that no good state of affairs can be such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting two specific scenarios: a forest fire that causes a fawn to suffer intense agony before dying, and a five-year-old girl being beaten, raped, and strangled to death. The argument's conclusion is that probably no good state of affairs can be such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting these scenarios. This conclusion is reached by applying the principle of induction, which is a basic principle of human reasoning that allows us to make inferences about the unknown based on what we know about the known.
The argument from evil is sound and establishes that God probably does not exist. The argument's validity rests on the fact that every state of affairs we know about that could be morally justified by God's actions is either obtainable without God having to permit both scenarios, or would not morally justify God's actions if it existed. The argument also relies on the principle of induction, which is a fundamental aspect of human reasoning.
In conclusion, the argument from evil is a persuasive and well-reasoned argument that suggests that God probably does not exist. The argument's validity rests on the principle of induction, and its soundness is supported by the fact that no good state of affairs can be morally justified by God's actions in the scenarios presented.";"Although there are various arguments referred to as 'the argument from evil,' and there is ongoing debate about which one is most compelling, I will present and defend the following argument from William Rowe[1]. Let's begin by defining two scenarios: (E1) A lightning strike ignites a forest fire, causing a fawn to suffer excruciating pain before eventually dying. (E2) A five-year-old girl is brutally assaulted, raped, and murdered by her mother's boyfriend. The argument is as follows: (P) There is no known good state of affairs that justifies God in allowing E1 and E2. Therefore, it is likely that: (Q) There is no good state of affairs that justifies God in allowing E1 and E2. Consequently, it is likely that: (R) God does not exist. The inference from Q to R should be self-evident: if Q is true and God exists, then God would not have permitted E1 and E2. However, these events did occur. I am not aware of any substantial challenges to this inference. Therefore, defending the argument from evil involves two aspects: demonstrating the truth of P and establishing the validity of the inference from P to Q. P is justified by the fact that upon reflection, every known state of affairs that justifies God in allowing E1 and E2 can either be achieved by God without permitting both E1 and E2, or obtaining them would not morally justify God in permitting both E1 and E2[2]. To support the inference from P to Q, we rely on the principle of induction. Humans make epistemic leaps from the known to the unknown on a daily basis, and this is considered justified and standard. For example, we have never encountered a thousand-foot-tall human being; therefore, we are justified in concluding that such beings do not exist. The strength of this justification depends on the thoroughness of the search. In the case of thousand-foot-tall humans, we have seven billion normal-sized humans today who would undoubtedly report any sightings, as well as various monitoring technologies in populated areas. If a thousand-foot-tall human existed, we would likely know about it. Similarly, in the case of Christianity, we have a two-thousand-year history of scholars and theologians who have extensively discussed and debated the subject, attempting to provide a successful theodicy. If such a theodicy existed, we would probably be aware of it. This fundamental principle is regularly employed by humans. To argue against it is, as Rowe puts it, 'simply to encourage radical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general'[3]. This principle applies to everything we observe in the natural realm, and since the existence of God would have observable consequences in this realm, there is no reason why it should not apply to that as well. Therefore, I assert that the argument from evil is valid and establishes that God probably does not exist.

82;"Con, thank you for your contribution. Women face injustice all around the world; in many cultures, even today, a male baby is preferable to a female baby to give you an example. Starting before their birth, women have to continuously deal with inequality. This unfairness may thus lead to a conscious or unconscious feeling of inferiority. Women have been told how to act, what to say, what to wear, more than men and so we can notice that a little girl is, more often, perfectly aware of her gender role, of the role of the feminine in the society than a little boy is of his. Imitating her mother, learning from her entourage, the little girl faces a stricter education. To reaffirm their existence, women started the feminist movement in the 1960s (women's fight against sexism can not be limited to this movement of course). Today, both victims of and partially leading to the hypersexualization phenomena, women are, even though they get the illusion that they are making their own choices, for most influenced by existing authorities. Buying a simple item of clothing because they want to doesn't mean that they are fully in control of their actions. We are surrounded by media messages,that offer women 'role models' they should look up to. Prejudices and the existing system in our societies push women to try pleasing men's expectations too. Even though it looks like it is getting better (and it is) and that women are in power, they are under pressure and unconsciously our consciously guided by authorities and media above mentioned. In addition to this, since we are debating on the hypersexualization of young girls, we should take in consideration their age, and the fact that they are, at their age (8-13) too young to make that kind of decisions without any guidance.";"The argument presented is ineffective in several ways. Firstly, it relies on a flawed premise that a male baby is preferable to a female baby in many cultures, which is not supported by evidence. This statement perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces the idea that one gender is superior to the other.
Secondly, the argument fails to acknowledge the agency and autonomy of women in society. Women are not passive victims of societal pressure, but rather active participants in the hypersexualization of young girls. The media and authorities may exert influence over women's choices, but women are not completely powerless in the face of these forces.
Furthermore, the argument oversimplifies the complex issue of hypersexualization by reducing it to a simple matter of women being influenced by existing authorities and media. The reality is more nuanced, with multiple factors contributing to the hypersexualization of young girls, including cultural norms, economic forces, and the objectification of women's bodies in society.
Finally, the argument ignores the critical role that age plays in the hypersexualization of young girls. Children at the age of 8-13 are still developing their sense of self and are not yet fully equipped to make informed decisions about their bodies and sexuality. The argument fails to acknowledge the need for protective measures to safeguard the well-being and dignity of young girls in the face of societal pressures.
In conclusion, the argument presented is ineffective in addressing the issue of hypersexualization of young girls due to its flawed premises, lack of agency for women, oversimplification of the issue, and failure to consider the critical role of age. A more effective approach would involve a comprehensive analysis of the complex factors contributing to the hypersexualization of young girls, with a focus on empowering women and protecting the well-being of children.";Con, thank you for your contribution. It is important to acknowledge that women face various challenges globally. For instance, in certain cultures, there is a preference for male babies over female babies. This inequality begins even before birth and continues throughout a woman's life. Consequently, women may develop a sense of inferiority, whether consciously or unconsciously. Society often imposes strict expectations on women, dictating their behavior, speech, and attire more so than men. As a result, young girls tend to be more aware of their gender roles and societal expectations compared to young boys. The feminist movement, which emerged in the 1960s, was initiated by women to address these inequalities (although it is important to note that women's fight against sexism extends beyond this movement). Presently, women find themselves both victims of and contributors to the hypersexualization phenomenon. Despite the illusion of making their own choices, women are often influenced by existing authorities. Their actions, such as purchasing clothing items, may not necessarily reflect complete control over their decisions. Media messages and societal prejudices play a significant role in shaping women's choices and pushing them to conform to men's expectations. While progress has been made, it is crucial to recognize that women still face pressure and are guided, consciously or unconsciously, by authorities and media. Additionally, when discussing the hypersexualization of young girls, it is important to consider their age and acknowledge that they may be too young (between 8-13 years old) to make such decisions without proper guidance.;conservative

84;I am completely against hitting or spanking students for punishment in schools. First off, I am still in school, in middle school actually.. and I think that if you punish a child it should not be harsh as in pain. This doesnt solve problems it only keeps them calm at the monment of. They will never understand the actual reason you are punishing them unless you talk to them. Second, it is still surpprisingly legal in 23 states in America. The United States is the only state in the western world which still tolerates corporal punishment in its schools. There are many forms of this as in strapping or whipping, and even cuffing the child behind the head. These things start to give some students nervous habits such as nail bitting being the one of the most common. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools and takes issue with laws in some states legalizing such corporal punishment and protecting adults who use it from prosecution for child abuse. Now, i would thank anyone who will take on my propostion and show me the other side, if there is one :);I strongly disagree with the idea of hitting or spanking students as a form of punishment in schools. As a middle school student myself, I believe that physical punishment does not effectively address the underlying issues and can lead to long-term negative consequences. Firstly, it does not provide the child with a clear understanding of why they are being punished, leading to confusion and frustration. Secondly, it is surprising that corporal punishment is still legal in 23 states in the United States, despite being the only country in the western world to do so. This form of punishment can result in a range of negative behaviors, including nervous habits such as nail biting, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has expressed opposition to its use in schools. I invite those who disagree with me to present their arguments and shed light on the other side of this issue.;I am in favor of implementing alternative disciplinary measures in schools instead of hitting or spanking students. Firstly, it is important to consider that punishment should not cause physical pain, but rather focus on addressing the underlying issues. By engaging in open communication with the child, they can better understand the reasons behind their actions and learn from their mistakes. Secondly, it is worth noting that corporal punishment is still legally permitted in 23 states in America, making the United States unique among Western countries. This practice encompasses various forms, such as strapping, whipping, and even cuffing students behind the head. These methods can lead to the development of nervous habits, with nail biting being a common example. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools and raises concerns about laws that legalize such practices, as they may protect adults who engage in child abuse.

85;BOP was never an important component to anyone except whom have never had what it takes to win any conflict to begin with. Philosophers did not need to give people a BOP, they said what they said based on what they observed and analyze through decades of their time - what they said was either agreed upon or disagreed upon, there wasn't any BOP involved. Over that period of time, philosophy gave birth to what we know today as Science. Science is not based on BOP - it's based on high-level observation, analysis and demonstration. Philosophy has always had a harder time with people, because it's not as easily demonstrated, because it requires the receiver to not be stupid and receptive towards what they are saying, throughout the context it bares truly. Science works with an already existing system of function and reaction, so it's easier to show people that what you're saying is true when you can recreate what you have observed and analyzed - other things, like human psyche, dream analogies, parables - everything that is felt, instead of seen, are impossible to demonstrate, which is wise men take this reality as they would seeing a flash of lightning - it's all relative, you can't teach everyone everything, so either lose your mind and have some fun, or close yourself off from the people to live in a remote area. The human mind is split up in two way, things that can be seen - things that can't be felt. I have no imagination that I can see, I can only feel shapes, essence and colors. I can't see, because seeing is not the only component - BOP is based on seeing - evidence is based on seeing - demonstation, acceptance, realization are all about feeling.;The notion that BOP (British Occupation Philosophy) was crucial to philosophers and thinkers throughout history is misguided. Philosophers did not need BOP to formulate their ideas, as they based their arguments on observation, analysis, and critical thinking. In fact, philosophy laid the groundwork for modern science, which relies on empirical evidence and replicable results rather than BOP. While philosophy may be more abstract and difficult to demonstrate, it is no less valid or important than science. The human mind is divided between visible and invisible aspects, with seeing playing a primary role in BOP and feeling being the foundation of imagination and creativity. I cannot see, but I can feel shapes, essences, and colors, and it is through this inner experience that I gain insight and understanding. BOP may be based on sight, but true understanding comes from within.;BOP has always been a crucial element in any conflict, as it determines the burden of proof for each side. While philosophers may argue that they did not require a BOP, their statements were still subject to agreement or disagreement. However, it is important to note that philosophy has paved the way for the development of science over time. Science, unlike philosophy, relies on high-level observation, analysis, and demonstration. This makes it easier to convince people of the truthfulness of scientific claims, as they can be recreated and observed. On the other hand, philosophical concepts such as human psyche, dream analogies, and parables are more challenging to demonstrate, as they are based on subjective experiences. Therefore, individuals with a conservative ideology may choose to embrace the concrete evidence provided by science, rather than the abstract concepts of philosophy.;conservative

87;if we would allow partial birth abortion, by extension, we should also allow killing the baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion. i would like a rhetorical debate. i am actually against this. but, i want someone who is for partial birth abortion etc but say they are against this to debate me. i am aware that partial birth is banned by federal law now... but it's a hypothetical debate. (we could also consider pregnancies that are beginning to be delievered, are aborted and then are removed, without a technical partial birth.) why allow one, but not the other? we might say that the birth point is our arbitrary magic point. but why is this arbitrary point of any true significance? the mother is not going to be hindered if we delivered the baby alive instead of aborting.... so her claim to body rights or emotional distress etc are just as valid or invalid with a born baby. we might decide that we have to decide a point... and any point will be arbitrary. and there's a slippery slope that cannot be escaped... any point you pick, a few minutes in difference is not really subtantial. but, why not choose a point that is at least more debateable to allow the abortion, and then ban it later on? if we're going that route, of banning abortion, that is, and trying to find points that are of worth in when to ban. if we are not trying to find a more plausible point... then why not follow partial birth to its logical conclusion and just kill the baby out of womb?;"If we allow partial birth abortion, it logically follows that we should also allow killing the baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion. This hypothetical debate aims to explore the inconsistencies in the argument for partial birth abortion. While some argue that the birth point is an arbitrary magic point, others argue that the mother's rights to bodily autonomy and emotional distress are just as valid with a born baby as they are with a fetus. By examining the reasoning behind these claims, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex issues surrounding abortion.
The argument for partial birth abortion is based on the idea that a woman has the right to control her own body and make decisions about her health. However, this right is not absolute, and there are limits to this right. Allowing partial birth abortion up until the point of delivery is seen as a reasonable limit, as it allows the woman to have control over her body while also protecting the life of the fetus.
However, this argument is not without its inconsistencies. If we allow partial birth abortion, why not also allow killing the baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion? The argument that the birth point is an arbitrary magic point is not a convincing one, as it ignores the fact that the fetus is a living being with inherent rights and dignity. The mother's rights to bodily autonomy and emotional distress are important, but they do not supersede the rights of the unborn child.
In conclusion, while the argument for partial birth abortion is rooted in the idea of a woman's right to control her own body, it is important to consider the inconsistencies in this argument. By examining the reasoning behind the argument and the rights of both the mother and the fetus, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex issues surrounding abortion. Ultimately, the decision to allow or ban abortion is a complex and controversial issue that requires careful consideration of all the relevant factors.";Allowing partial birth abortion does not necessarily mean we should also allow killing a baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion. Although I personally disagree with partial birth abortion, I am open to debating someone who supports it but opposes this scenario. While I understand that partial birth abortion is currently banned by federal law, this debate is hypothetical and explores the reasoning behind different points. We could also consider cases where pregnancies are being delivered, aborted, and then removed without a technical partial birth. The question is, why do we allow one but not the other? Some may argue that the birth point is an arbitrary distinction, but it is important to consider the significance of this point. The mother's claim to body rights or emotional distress remains valid or invalid regardless of whether the baby is born or aborted. If we have to establish a point, any point will be arbitrary, and there will always be a slippery slope. However, why not choose a point that allows for more debate and then consider banning it later on? If we are going down the path of banning abortion and seeking points to justify it, why not follow the logical conclusion of partial birth abortion and allow for the killing of the baby outside the womb?;conservative
88;In closing, I just want to say it was nice debating you! Now... Being the first may be nice and all, but the fact is, is that people have to push other things aside where other problems are in place. The fact is, there is other more pressing problems then the NASA funding. Giving up lives and allowing other problems to run rampant in the US and in the world and instead going off to Mars is not something that can or should be justified right now, with how much could be saved right now. You did say that you had those points, but however, there is no amount specifically allocated. You said 2.5 billion and something for the year. However, the approximate estimations weren't there for the rest of it. There obviously cannot be reallocation, otherwise there would be some funding being switched around. With that, it was fun. ^^;In conclusion, while it was enjoyable debating with you, the reality is that there are more pressing issues in the US and around the world that require attention and funding. The idea of sending humans to Mars is a noble pursuit, but it cannot be justified at the expense of other vital areas of spending, such as healthcare, education, and poverty reduction. While the proposed $2.5 billion allocation for NASA is a significant amount, it is a drop in the ocean compared to the overall federal budget. Moreover, the lack of specific allocation for the remaining funding makes it impossible to reallocate resources effectively. In light of these considerations, it is crucial to prioritize spending on pressing domestic and global challenges rather than diverting resources to a long-term goal like Mars colonization.;In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for engaging in this debate. Now, while being the first may have its merits, it is important to prioritize pressing issues over NASA funding. Sacrificing lives and neglecting other problems in the United States and the world, in order to pursue a mission to Mars, cannot be justified at this moment, especially considering the potential savings that could be achieved. You mentioned an allocation of 2.5 billion for the year, but the specific breakdown for the remaining funds was not provided. It is evident that reallocation is not feasible without impacting other areas of funding. With that being said, it has been an enjoyable exchange of ideas. ^^;conservative

Like saying sex before marriage is the reason why we think how we think as an individual is not right, or sex before marriage causes a lot of people to go into debt with the economy is not right, or marriage not lasting long or relationships don't last long cause people decide to have sex before marriage is not right, you cant blame having sex before marriage on how society is today. when you speak of sex before marriage having a big role on how people are today you have to be more specific on what kind of problems. If your talking about pregnancy rates going up on the people who are not married to let you know women can get pregnant with out even having intercourse with any guy. You cant really blame sex for how society is, or the way people think or act, its a new age a new time sex isn't the root of problems. Want to blame something blame technology while technology got more advance that's when people changed and made society the way it is. Even with out sex today will be the same as it is with sex, sex isn't even the issue like I said that changed modern society. The technology of today changed the way we think, the way we act. I also get what your saying to, but like I said want something to blame is technology not sex, like I said sex is a choice not a problem starter, it does not have any affect on the whole world what you and your partner are doing behind close doors, what goes on behind close doors stays behind close doors.;"The issue at hand is the notion that sex before marriage is the root cause of various problems in modern society.

While it is true that technology has advanced and changed society, it is unfair to place blame solely on sex. In fact, sex is a personal choice that does not inherently cause problems in society. Rather, it is the way society has evolved and changed that has led to the current state of affairs.
To effectively address the issues at hand, it is crucial to be more specific about the problems caused by premarital sex and to consider other factors that may be contributing to these problems, such as the influence of technology and societal changes. By doing so, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the issue and work towards finding solutions that are effective and practical.";"Sex before marriage has been wrongly attributed as the cause of various societal issues. To effectively address this topic, it is important to specify the particular problems that arise from premarital sex in our modern society. For instance, it can be argued that engaging in sexual activities before marriage leads to a decline in personal values and moral standards. Additionally, it may contribute to financial burdens and unstable relationships, as individuals prioritize physical intimacy over long-term commitment. However, it is crucial to note that blaming premarital sex for the current state of society is misguided. It is inaccurate to solely attribute rising pregnancy rates to sexual intercourse, as women can conceive without engaging in sexual activity. Furthermore, sex itself is not the root cause of societal changes; rather, it is the advancement of technology that has significantly influenced our thoughts and behaviors. If we seek to assign blame, it should be directed towards the impact of technology on society, not consensual sexual relationships. Ultimately, what occurs behind closed doors between consenting adults should not be held responsible for the broader issues we face as a society.";conservative

While I understand the desire to prioritize safety, the potential for innocent individuals to be wrongly targeted or harassed is a significant concern. As someone who has personally experienced the frustration of being unfairly targeted by airport security, I believe it is crucial to strike a balance between safety and individual rights. The government must find alternative methods that are both effective and constitutional.;Although it is undeniable that ensuring our safety may require some level of discomfort, it is important to consider the potential violation of our constitutional rights. As a conservative, I firmly believe in upholding the principles outlined in our constitution. Furthermore, personal experiences have shown that innocent individuals can be mistakenly targeted as potential threats. For instance, as an Indian traveler, I was subjected to an extensive search and interrogation at an airport due to a minor issue caused by a coin in my pocket. This highlights the unconstitutional nature of the government's actions.;conservative

96;"You'll notice that Pro has not even attempted to argue how or why that participating in these pageants is fun for young girls. On the contrary, I've pointed out how these pageants are literally a form of child abuse according to the definition provided by two federal government acts of legislation. Additionally, I've explained how these pageants actually cause harm and inflict emotional, mental and sometimes even physical damage amongst participants. Pro noted in the last round that winning makes a child feel beautiful or handsome. First, I don't know why Pro is mentioning ""handsome"" since one of the only things she said in a previous round was that she believes these pageants should be limited to girls only. Second, only ONE person out of all of the contestants can be the winner. That means that there are far greater chances and occurrences of losing than winning. Additionally, I doubt one person would win every time. I've detailed how the pressures of losing these contests costs a great deal of stress and other burdens that young children are inept to cope with at such a young age. Moreover, Pro hasn't proven that children even want to partake in these endeavors, let alone argue that people tend to make friends at these events. Meanwhile, I've noted how most of these relationships become competitive to the point where it's unhealthy. So, overall, Pro has nowhere near fulfilled her burden of affirming the resolution. I encourage a vote for the Con.";You'll notice that Pro has not provided any evidence or reasoning to support their claim that participating in beauty pageants is fun for young girls. Instead, they have focused on highlighting the negative aspects of these events, including the potential for emotional, mental, and physical harm to participants. I have pointed out how these pageants are in fact a form of child abuse, as defined by federal government acts of legislation. Additionally, I have shown how the pressure to win these contests can lead to significant stress and burden for young children, who are not yet equipped to handle such pressures. Furthermore, I have argued that the competitive nature of these events often leads to unhealthy relationships between participants. Pro has not addressed these points, and has failed to fulfill their burden of proving the resolution. Therefore, I encourage a vote for the Con.;Pro has failed to provide any evidence or explanation as to why participating in these pageants is enjoyable for young girls. However, I have presented compelling evidence that these pageants can be considered a form of child abuse, as defined by two federal government acts of legislation. Furthermore, I have demonstrated how these pageants can cause emotional, mental, and even physical harm to the participants. Pro's argument about winning making a child feel beautiful or handsome is questionable, especially since she previously stated that these pageants should be limited to girls only. Additionally, with only one winner out of many contestants, the chances of losing are far greater. The pressures of losing can lead to significant stress and burdens that young children are ill-equipped to handle. Pro has also failed to prove that children actually desire to participate in these pageants, let alone make friends at these events. On the other hand, I have shown that most relationships formed in these pageants become overly competitive and unhealthy. In conclusion, Pro has not fulfilled her burden of supporting the resolution, and I urge readers to vote for the Con.;conservative
97;Accepted. I will argue that planets are NOT islands. planet - any of the eight large heavenly bodies revolving about the sun and shining by reflected light ( <URL>... ) island - 1. a tract of land completely surrounded by water, and not large enough to be called a continent 2. something resembling an island, especially in being isolated or having little or no direct communication with others 3. a raised platform with a counter or other work surface on top situated in the middle area of a room, especially a kitchen, so as to permit access from all sides 4. safety island 5. a low concrete platform for gasoline pumps at an automotive service station ( <URL>... ) I'm guessing my opponent will argue that planets are islands by using the second definition of island I provided, but I just put all of the definitions there for the heck of it. State your case.;"The argument presented is ineffective because it fails to provide a clear and concise explanation of why planets are not islands. The argument relies on multiple definitions of the term ""island,"" but does not effectively address the core issue at hand. The argument could be improved by providing a clear and logical explanation of why the definitions of ""island"" do not apply to planets. Additionally, the argument could benefit from providing evidence or examples to support the claim.
Here is an effective argument that addresses the issue at hand:
Planets are not islands because they are not completely surrounded by water. While some planets may have bodies of water surrounding them, they are not fully enclosed by water, which is the definition of an island. Furthermore, planets have their own unique characteristics, such as atmosphere and gravity, that distinguish them from islands. By examining the definitions of ""island"" and the characteristics of planets, it becomes clear that planets are not islands.";Accepted. I will argue that planets are indeed islands. According to the definition of an island, it can be interpreted as a tract of land completely surrounded by water, and not large enough to be called a continent. Planets, like Earth, can be seen as isolated celestial bodies in the vastness of space, resembling islands in their isolation and lack of direct communication with other celestial bodies. While there are other definitions of islands, I believe the first definition is the most relevant in this context. I look forward to hearing my opponent's case.;conservative

99;"I, unlike you, obviously disagree. I think it is very important for shelters to practice mandatory spays and neuters. This helps to keep population numbers from skyrocketing even more than they already are. They stray population and homeless pet numbers continue to climb without stopping. And in this economy, people are finding themselves returning or ""owner surrendering"" their pets to organizations such as local SPCAs and shelters. This adds to the already growing numbers in the kennels. Further, spaying and neutering is actually seen as health beneficial to the animals. It helps control certain cancers and helps keep pets, especially males, calmer and less likely to perform certain rituals such as ""spraying."" As far as an owner's right to breed, I disagree. The overpopulation should speak for itself in this day in age. There are plenty of animals available for adoption in shelters, breed-specific rescue groups, pet stores, etc. Breeding for a profit is unnecessary and irresponsible, not only for the community but to the animals.";"The argument presented is ineffective due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The writer seems to be unaware of the importance of proper grammar and punctuation, making it difficult to understand their point. However, I will attempt to paraphrase the argument in a more effective and clear manner.
The writer believes that shelters should practice mandatory spays and neuters to control the growing population of stray and homeless animals. They argue that without this measure, the population will continue to skyrocket, leading to an overcrowding of kennels and an increase in the number of pets being surrendered by their owners. Additionally, the writer believes that spaying and neutering is health beneficial for the animals, as it helps control certain cancers and reduces aggressive behavior in males.
While the writer acknowledges the right of animal owners to breed, they argue that the overpopulation of animals is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. They suggest that there are already plenty of animals available for adoption in shelters, breed-specific rescue groups, and pet stores, making breeding for profit unnecessary and irresponsible.
In conclusion, the writer's argument is effective in highlighting the importance of controlling the population of stray and homeless animals, but it could be improved by providing more specific data and statistics to support their claims, as well as a clearer explanation of the benefits of spaying and neutering.";I, like you, strongly agree. It is crucial for shelters to implement mandatory spays and neuters. This measure effectively prevents the population from further escalating. The stray population and the number of homeless pets continue to rise unabated. Moreover, in the current economic climate, individuals are increasingly relinquishing their pets to organizations like local SPCAs and shelters. This exacerbates the already burgeoning numbers in kennels. Additionally, spaying and neutering has proven health benefits for animals. It helps control certain cancers and promotes a calmer demeanor in pets, particularly males, reducing the likelihood of certain behaviors like spraying. Regarding an owner's right to breed, I firmly believe that the overwhelming overpopulation issue speaks for itself in this modern era. There is an abundance of animals available for adoption in shelters, breed-specific rescue groups, pet stores, and other avenues. Breeding for profit is both unnecessary and irresponsible, not only for the community but also for the well-being of the animals.;conservative
