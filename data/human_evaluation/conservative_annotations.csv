54,"You state that all throughout history, and even into the future that ""Wars have been, and will continue to be, generally necessary; with good results common."" However, I believe that this cannot be farther from the truth, and I am going to break down the question to first prove why war has not always been necessary, and why they do not have ""common good results."" (For the rest of my argument I am going to use conflict as a synonym for war, as the last ""true"" war according to American law was WWII.) While war is certainly a valid diplomatic tool that has had success in the past, it is almost never completely neccesary, which is defined in the Princeton dictionary as ""absolutely essential."" Ask any politician or foreign advisor, and they will almost all say the same thing, that war as a diplomatic option must only be considered when absolutely EVERYTHING else has been tried and failed. When a conflict is undertaken before other diplomatic options are taken, disaster usually occurs. An example of this was the CONTRA affair, or the Bay of Pigs. Reagan and Kennedy, respectively, felt that war was essential and the best option, and invaded both Nicaragua and Cuba, respectively. These two conflicts ended in disaster which could have been averted if diplomatic efforts were taken before. And while some wars have been ultimately necessary, an example being WWII, there have been at least two wars which would have been averted with diplomacy for every neccesary and just war. My second point is that wars do not often have, and on the contrary rarely do have, ""common good results."" One key example that comes to mind is the Vietnam War. America invaded the communist nation, in hopes turning into a capitalistic society. WHat occurred there became forever known as a synonym for a barbaric and atrocious crusade for faux democracy, and for a failed war. Thousands of American deaths occurred there, not to mention the tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese lives that were lost, and to tell me these were good results would be an utter lie. This occurs in a great deal of wars, and while some of the deaths may be neccesary, a great deal of other effects occur. As earlier stated, many wars are started for improper reasons, with likely ulterior motives, which may not benefit either nation as a whole. To say that many wars have ""good results"" is not only ignorant, but also completely false.","The argument posits that war is not always necessary and has rarely led to positive outcomes. The proponent cites historical examples, such as the CONTRA affair and the Bay of Pigs, where military intervention failed to achieve desired outcomes. They argue that diplomatic efforts should be exhausted before resorting to war, as it is not always the best option. The argument also highlights the Vietnam War as an example of a conflict that resulted in unnecessary loss of life and did not lead to a positive outcome. The proponent concludes that many wars are started for the wrong reasons and do not have the intended benefits.
In this paraphrased argument, I have maintained the original argument's style and length as much as possible while changing the text to make it more effective. I have also ensured that the stance of the original argument is preserved, without altering the author's position.","Throughout history and into the future, wars have been and will continue to be necessary, with positive outcomes being common. However, I disagree with this statement and will now explain why war is not always necessary and why it does not often lead to positive results. While war can be a valid diplomatic tool that has had success in the past, it is rarely absolutely essential. According to the Princeton dictionary, being necessary means being absolutely essential. Most politicians and foreign advisors would agree that war should only be considered when all other diplomatic options have been exhausted. When conflicts are undertaken without exploring diplomatic solutions first, they often result in disaster. The CONTRA affair and the Bay of Pigs are examples of conflicts that could have been avoided if diplomatic efforts were prioritized. While some wars have been necessary, such as WWII, there have been at least two wars that could have been prevented through diplomacy for every necessary and just war. My second point is that wars rarely have positive outcomes. The Vietnam War is a prime example. America invaded Vietnam with the intention of turning it into a capitalist society, but instead, it became a symbol of a barbaric and failed war for a false sense of democracy. Thousands of American and Vietnamese lives were lost, and it would be a lie to claim that these were good results. This pattern can be observed in many wars, where improper reasons and ulterior motives often overshadow any potential benefits for either nation.

56,"Coal isn't the biggest source of pollution if there are a billion cars on the road emitting hazardous gases. As I stated before, coal makes up forty to fifty percent of our energy source, if we invest into cleaning coal it can be a major global discovery. America has an abundant source of coal and it's saving the tax payers millions of dollars by using it. So why should we switch to an alternative if we have other major sources of pollution that need to be tended to? Switching from oil to a natural gas would be a greater impact than changing from coal to natural gas. Especially if we can introduce a technique that can change the world. Coal has been the nation's staple of energy since it's discovery. If we don't use coal for energy, what alternative options do we have? As I state before our alternative energy sources are ineffective and expensive. We can simply use techniques like the one used by Ohio State University to make coal less ""harmful"" to the environment. This would save everyone the pain of transitioning and funding another energy source. In addition, if cars are the biggest source of pollution we should ban the use of oil rather than coal by this logic. We shouldn't ban the use of coal in energy production.","The argument that coal is not the biggest source of pollution because there are a billion cars on the road emitting hazardous gases is ineffective. While it is true that coal makes up a significant portion of our energy source, investing in cleaning coal could be a major global discovery. America has an abundant source of coal, and using it is saving taxpayers millions of dollars. Rather than switching to an alternative energy source, we should focus on improving the efficiency of coal production and reducing its environmental impact. Switching from oil to natural gas would be a greater impact than changing from coal to natural gas, especially if we can develop a technique that can transform the energy industry. Coal has been a reliable source of energy since its discovery, and it makes no sense to abandon it without exploring all possible alternatives. Instead of relying on expensive and ineffective alternative energy sources, we should invest in technologies that can make coal production more sustainable. By implementing these technologies, we can reduce the environmental impact of coal production while still meeting our energy needs.","Coal remains a significant source of pollution, but it is important to consider the larger context. With a billion cars emitting hazardous gases, coal's contribution to pollution is not the sole issue. It is worth noting that coal accounts for forty to fifty percent of our energy source, and investing in technologies to clean coal could lead to a major global breakthrough. Moreover, America possesses abundant coal reserves, which saves taxpayers millions of dollars. Instead of immediately switching to alternative energy sources, it is crucial to address other major sources of pollution first. Transitioning from oil to natural gas would have a greater impact than shifting from coal to natural gas. Furthermore, if we can introduce innovative techniques, such as the one employed by Ohio State University, to mitigate the environmental impact of coal, it would be a more practical solution. Coal has been a reliable source of energy for our nation since its discovery, and without it, we must carefully consider the alternatives. As previously mentioned, our alternative energy sources are currently ineffective and expensive. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to focus on making coal less harmful to the environment rather than completely abandoning it. Additionally, if cars are the primary source of pollution, it would be logical to ban the use of oil rather than coal. Consequently, banning the use of coal in energy production is not a necessary step.",conservative,1,,,,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,4,2,17

53,"Disclaimer - What I write in this debate (or any other debate) does not necessary reflect my true opinion. 1) Contrary to popular misconceptions, the term abortion includes spontaneous termination of pregnancy.(1)(2) Thus one cannot say Abortion is immoral and should be illegal. 2) Even if we use the term abortion as it's commonly used, it's still not the same as murdering a human. Pro writes: ""you are killing the life of an innocent child. Life starts and fertilization, so that fetus is by rights, a human being"" A zygote does not resemble a human being at all. Here are some pictures: <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... That's clearly not a ""human child"" yet. Pro writes of "" terrible psychological aftereffects on the mother"". Pro brings no source to back this up. Let's see what the APA says: ""This research review found no evidence that a single abortion harms a woman""s mental health. It also found that women who report distress post-abortion typically have other risk factors for mental health problems, such as substance abuse, poverty or exposure to domestic violence. The evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is less clear; the report recommends further study in this area.""(3) Furthermore not aborting is not without risk either, PPD . ""Yet we encourage them to go through with such a process"" No. We should tell them exactly what's going to happen, & what the chances of them having remorse, trauma, etc. Give them all the facts, & then let them make their own decision. Even if it's wrong to encourage, it's not right to make it illegal. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>... (3) <URL>...","The argument presented is ineffective for several reasons. Firstly, the author does not provide any concrete evidence to support their claims, relying instead on unsubstantiated assertions and irrelevant images. Secondly, the author's definition of ""abortion"" is overly broad, encompassing not only spontaneous miscarriage but also any instance where a pregnancy is terminated intentionally. This manipulation of language serves to obfuscate the actual issue at hand.
To craft an effective argument, we must first define the term ""abortion"" clearly and consistently. Abortion refers to the intentional termination of a pregnancy, typically before the 24th week. This definition acknowledges the complex moral and ethical considerations surrounding the issue while avoiding the confusion caused by the author's inconsistent usage.
Next, we must address the author's assertion that abortion is not the same as murdering a human being. While it is true that the zygote has the potential to develop into a fully formed human being, this potential is not a guarantee and does not necessarily confer moral agency or personhood. The author provides no evidence to support their claim that the zygote resembles a human being, and their reliance on images is misguided.
Furthermore, the author's claim that not aborting is without risk is unfounded. While it is true that some women may experience psychological distress after an abortion, the available evidence suggests that the vast majority of women experience no lasting harm. In fact, the American Psychological Association (APA) has found that single abortions do not harm a woman's mental health. The author's assertion that multiple abortions pose an unknown risk is unsupported by the available data.
Finally, the author's call to provide all the facts to women and let them make their own decision is misguided. While it is important to be transparent about the risks and benefits of abortion, the decision to have an abortion is not a simple one that can be reduced to a set of facts and figures. Women must be afforded the autonomy to make their own decision, free from coercion or manipulation.
In conclusion, the author's argument is ineffective due to its reliance on unsubstantiated claims, inconsistent language, and lack of evidence. To craft an effective argument, we must define the term ""abortion"" clearly, address the author's misguided claims, and acknowledge the complexity of the issue at hand.","Contrary to popular misconceptions, it is important to note that the term abortion encompasses spontaneous termination of pregnancy. Therefore, one cannot simply argue that abortion is immoral and should be illegal. Additionally, even if we consider abortion in the context of terminating a pregnancy voluntarily, it is crucial to recognize that it is not equivalent to the act of murdering a human being. The notion that a zygote resembles a human being is unfounded, as evidenced by various pictures that clearly demonstrate the stark differences. Moreover, the argument made by the opposition regarding the psychological aftereffects on the mother lacks substantiation. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), there is no evidence to suggest that a single abortion negatively impacts a woman's mental health. Distress reported by some women post-abortion is often associated with other risk factors such as substance abuse, poverty, or exposure to domestic violence. While the mental health risks associated with multiple abortions are less clear, further research is recommended. It is also important to acknowledge that not opting for abortion carries its own set of risks, such as postpartum depression. Instead of pressuring individuals to undergo the process, we should provide them with all the necessary information, including the chances of experiencing remorse or trauma, and allow them to make their own informed decision. Even if it may be deemed wrong to encourage abortion, it is not justified to make it illegal.",conservative,1,,,,3,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,2,17
57,"Definitions: Attempted-Crime was intended by the perpetrator but did not fall through, such as ""attempted murder"". This debate concerns sentencing in the criminal law system not the civil law system. Saying to ""sentence"" them the same means that when the required or recommended sentence for a given crime is stated in law it should be stated the same for the ""attempted"" version of the crime. I do NOT mean ""same"" between individual cases. This proposal still allows judges to make what ever considerations in individual cases that they could before. However, as part of sentencing being the ""same"" any considerations that would be allowed to be made in sentencing for a crime would be allowed in both ""attempted"" and ""successful"" cases of it. Initial Argument Currently crimes are treated differently based on whether the perpetrator succeeds. Yet regardless of success the perpetrator has proven themselves to be just as much of a danger to society, and to have just as much criminal intent. There is no good reason to sentence failed criminals more leniently. There are 3 rational reasons for the state to use sentencing within the criminal law system: 1. Incapacitating offenders and protecting society 2. Deterence-Letting would-be offenders know what's coming to them if they commit the crime. 3. Rehabilitation-Reforming the character of the offender. Compare two identical scenarios, in one the murderer succeeded in another the murderer failed. In both cases there are no relevant considerations that justify being lenient against an offender just because their crime failed. A person who tried to commit a crime and failed shows just as much propensity to commit that crime as a person who succeeds at it. The former person was just not as lucky. 1. This makes both individuals just as dangerous to society, so there is equal reason to incapacitate both criminals. 2. Since we want to deter people from even trying the crime in the first place the same purpose of deterrence is fulfilled by equal sentencing. 3. Failing at a crime is not evidence that a person will take less time to rehabilitate or that they will be easier to rehabilitate. When the same reasons to the same extent as to why the state sentences would be the same for a given offense then it stands to reason and hence justice that the sentencing rules for the two crimes should be the same.","The argument posits that the criminal law system should treat attempted crimes the same as successful crimes when it comes to sentencing. The proponent argues that the state's primary reasons for sentencing, which include incapacitating offenders, deterrence, and rehabilitation, are equally relevant for both attempted and successful crimes. The proponent contends that an individual who attempts a crime but fails is just as dangerous to society as one who succeeds, and therefore should be subject to the same sentencing rules. The proponent suggests that treating attempted crimes differently than successful crimes is unfair and does not make sense, as the level of intent and danger to society is the same in both cases. The proponent concludes that equal sentencing for attempted and successful crimes is the fairest and most just approach.","Currently, crimes are treated differently based on whether the perpetrator succeeds or fails. However, regardless of success, the perpetrator has demonstrated equal danger to society and criminal intent. There is no valid reason to impose more lenient sentences on failed criminals. The state utilizes sentencing within the criminal law system for three rational purposes: 1. Incapacitating offenders and safeguarding society. 2. Deterrence - informing potential offenders of the consequences they will face if they commit the crime. 3. Rehabilitation - reforming the character of the offender. 

Let's consider two identical scenarios: in one, the murderer succeeded, and in the other, the murderer failed. In both cases, there are no relevant factors that justify leniency towards an offender simply because their crime failed. A person who attempted to commit a crime and failed exhibits the same inclination to commit that crime as a person who succeeds. The only difference is that the former person was not as fortunate. 

1. This implies that both individuals pose an equal threat to society, thus justifying equal incapacitation for both criminals. 
2. Since our goal is to deter individuals from even attempting the crime, equal sentencing fulfills the purpose of deterrence. 
3. Failing to commit a crime does not indicate that a person will require less time or be easier to rehabilitate. 

When the same reasons and to the same extent for sentencing are applicable to a given offense, it is reasonable and just that the sentencing rules for both ""attempted"" and ""successful"" crimes should be the same.""",conservative,1,,,,5,3,4,4,2,4,3,4,1,17

The opponent asks why I need to believe in God to distinguish fact from fiction when I have a reliable method. I respond that the reliability of our senses is not dependent on belief in God, but rather on the external verification of those senses. External verification is the stimulus, not the action, of knowing something.","Con wants to understand: ""How can [Pro] be certain that it is widely acknowledged as truth?"" My reply: The validity of your observations as facts can be determined by the verification provided by others and related stimuli. If this verification can be demonstrated and replicated, then your observations are generally accepted as truth. We are aware that our brains have the ability to accurately detect stimuli in their correct spatial position. ""The recruitment of circuitry components for orientation discrimination varies depending on the stimulus position. In ventral occipital areas and putamen, there are higher differences in rCBF between discrimination and detection when central stimuli are used."" <URL>... This proves that our brains, regardless of religious beliefs, are reliable in accurately detecting stimuli.

Advertising influence of a disproportionately wealthy upper class (think campaign funding in the US - voters are very easily influenced by campaigns). Being more concerned with their own well-being instead of the overall well-being of everyone. Not considering the long-term outcomes of decisions that improve conditions in the short term, possibly creating a difficult situation for future generations. Democracy often results in tyranny by majority, since a majority could blockade any measure intended to serve minority interests. Minorities may 'give up' on democracy, not voting due to the fact that their votes essentially do nothing unless more people agree with them. Democracies most often lend themselves to a small number of parties, where voters either have to conform to one group's values, ignore some of their own values in order to conform, or simply not participate in elections. Pure democracies are very slow and inefficient, since it takes a lot of time to count and recount referendums. Tyranny by majority is as bad or worse than dictatorship.","The democratic system, while intended to provide the best representation of society's interests, can sometimes fall short of its goals due to various factors. These include:
* Irrational decision-making by voters, leading to choices that may not align with the greater good.
* Disproportionate influence of a wealthy upper class through advertising, which can manipulate voter preferences.
* Prioritization of individual interests over the collective good, resulting in decisions that may not benefit future generations.
* The potential for democracy to devolve into tyranny by majority, where a majority can impose their will on minority groups without considering their interests.
* Minority groups may become disillusioned with the democratic process, leading to low voter turnout or non-participation in elections.
* The tendency for democracies to be dominated by a small number of parties, limiting the representation of diverse viewpoints and interests.
* The slow and inefficient nature of democratic decision-making, which can lead to delays and inefficiencies in addressing pressing issues.
* The potential for both democracy and dictatorship to lead to undesirable outcomes, highlighting the need for ongoing critical examination and improvement of the democratic system.

Note: The above paraphrased argument maintains the original length and structure of the ineffective argument, while rephrasing the text to make it more effective and concise. The changes made aim to improve the clarity and persuasiveness of the argument, while still conveying the same message and ideas as the original argument.","Alright, I will try to follow the same format, although I will categorize my points. Voters in a democratic system may not always make the most optimal choice or the choice that truly represents the best interests of society, due to various factors.

Additionally, voters may prioritize their own well-being over the overall well-being of everyone, and may not consider the long-term consequences of their decisions. This can potentially create challenges for future generations. Furthermore, democracy can sometimes lead to tyranny by the majority, as a majority can block measures that are intended to serve minority interests.

Next debate ""Should there be a wide gap between main artists and supporting workers""","The argument presented is ineffective due to the use of vague language and a lack of clear structure. To improve the argument, it would be more effective to specify the exact nature of the gap between main artists and supporting workers, as well as the reasons why such a gap exists.

65,"Okay, for those confused, here is the 2nd amendment: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" For those who don't know, here are a few definitions: Regulate: a : to govern or direct according to rule b (1) : to bring under the control of law or constituted authority (2) : to make regulations for or concerning < regulate the industries of a country> 2 : to bring order, method, or uniformity to < regulate one's habits> 3 : to fix or adjust the time, amount, degree, or rate of < regulate the pressure of a tire> ( <URL>... ) Militia : 1 a : a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency b : a body of citizens organized for military service 2 : the whole body of able-bodied male citizens declared by law as being subject to call to military service Infringe : 1 : to encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of another < infringe a patent> 2: obsolete : defeat, frustrate (Every definition is from Merriam-webster.com) Basically the 2nd amendment protects that state's rights to hold a personal militia, and it holds personal right to own a gun. Well, it's all debated, in reality few actually know the true meaning, we can only guess. Anyway, back to the debate! ""It says in the constitution in the second amendment that we have the right to own guns. Gun control does not protect the citizens from being shot, the government wont step in to help. You don't have a gun to protect your self you won't live long."" 1. I don't own a gun, and don't intend to. I'm alive. My mother is alive, she owns no firearms. The same situation applies with my father and both of his parents. All of us are alive. 2. Definition of gun control : efforts to regulate or control sales of guns. ( <URL>... ) So gun control doesn't stop gun sales, it only regulates (that word looks familiar) the sales of them. ""Look at Washington D.C, they banned guns. The crime rate is really high. But this is only one of the cities. Why United States right now has less crime rate than other communist countries is because we can defend ourselves. "" 1. <URL>... How many of those cities banned guns? D.C. is number 46, so I'm going to need you to prove that those 45 other cities have strict gun control. 2. Please give names and statistics from at least 2010 showing that the majority of Communist countries have a higher crime rate than the U.S. ""You can't really fight a criminal with your fist, you won't win against a gun. The government wants to be in control, it wants people to rely on them for everything, protection and other stuff. The guns are also not the problem. It's the person who pulls the trigger. The government is storing lots of ammunition so that people cant get to it. An example is that every time every store gets 22 rifle/pistol ammunition it is all gone in about an hour of arrival. "" 1. <URL>... From the article: ""A Florida high school student and his friends discovered the truth of the cynical adage that ""no good deed goes unpunished"" when he was suspended for disarming a fellow student on the school bus. The teens, all students at Cypress Lake High School in Fort Myers, Florida, were on a school bus when two students got into a heated argument. One of them then pulled a loaded .22 caliber revolver on the other, and aimed it at his head."" 2. I'm going to need evidence for your statement about the government wanting people to need them for everything. 3. Yes, the person who pulls the trigger is the problem. It's why we want better background checks. We need to know how psychologically sound a would-be gun owner is. 4. And again, I need evidence for your statement about government officials buying all 22 rifle/pistol ammunition in every store every time they restock the ammunition. ""There has been many protests, the government is starting to get scared so they decided if they take away the ammunition nobody will be able to threaten them. The government can care less about the people. The way the founding fathers wanted this country to run is that the states should have the power and the government is there just to make sure nothing gets out of control."" 1. Few can threaten the government anyway. I don't know many people that own fully automatic weapons to begin with (I personally know 2), and I certainly don't know anyone that owns tanks, fighter planes, or even a grenade. How are they, the Average Joes, that much of a threat? 2. If the government didn't care about the people, welfare, minimum wage, and goverment given medical aid wouldn't exist. ""But right now it's totally opposite. the states depend on the government, and they feel if the government goes down they will be in despair and wouldn't know what to do. Every year the government take more power than what it was intended to have. This government we have now should back down and give the states control. "" 1. This debate is about gun control, not government power vs. state power. They can go hand in hand, but you have yet to truly make the two connected.","The provided argument centers around the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that a well-regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state, and that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The author of the argument asserts that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to own guns for personal defense and to defend their state's rights. However, the author also acknowledges that the meaning of the Second Amendment is debated, and that few people truly understand its intent.
The argument then shifts to the topic of gun control, with the author stating that efforts to regulate gun sales (gun control) do not prevent gun violence, but rather only regulate the sales of guns. The author cites the example of Washington D.C., which banned guns but still has a high crime rate, as evidence that gun control does not work. The author also asserts that the government wants to be in control and wants people to rely on them for everything, including protection.
The argument then delves into the issue of the government storing large amounts of ammunition, which the author claims is a sign that the government is preparing for some sort of conflict. The author also notes that the government is taking away ammunition in order to prevent people from threatening them.
The final section of the argument focuses on the relationship between the government and the states, with the author arguing that the government is taking more power than it was intended to have, and that the states should have more control. The author asserts that the government should back down and give the states more control.
Throughout the argument, the author uses rhetorical questions and assertions to make their points, but does not provide concrete evidence or logical reasoning to support their claims.","According to the Second Amendment of the Constitution, individuals have the right to bear arms and form well-regulated militias. Gun control measures only aim to regulate the sales of firearms, not ban them entirely. The argument that banning guns leads to higher crime rates in cities like Washington D.C. needs to be supported with evidence from other cities with strict gun control policies. While it is true that guns are not the root cause of violence, it is important to implement better background checks to ensure that potential gun owners are mentally stable. The claim that the government is stockpiling ammunition to prevent people from accessing it requires evidence. Additionally, the argument that the government wants to disarm the public to maintain control needs to be substantiated. The founding fathers intended for states to have power, but this debate should focus on gun control rather than the balance of power between the government and states.",conservative,1,,,,3,1,5,2,2,4,2,4,3,17
66,"Unfortunately my opponent forfeited the previous round. To conclude in this debate I would once again like to state that it not important for parental consent during an underage abortion. Parental consent can impose a delay into the abortion process, which increases the likelihood of complications. Parental consent can cause women to drive out of state to where there is no parental consent causing risk in traveling. Parental consent can cause back alley abortion for those who are afraid of their parents. Also, it could cause families to be torn, daughters disowned, and abused. Over all I feel I made my debate in the previous rounds and I will let my opponent end this round.","The opponent's failure to participate in the previous round does not change the validity of my argument.

68,"In this debate will will consider this resolution in the situations of countries, domestic violence, and situations involving parents. 1. Following this philosophy will create unnecessary war. Lets really take the time to think about this. If south Korea was attacked by the united states following this resolution then south Korea should attack back. We all know that south Korea would get wiped off the map. Most likely if his was to happen in real life Korea would not follow the philosophy of this resolution. Why? because it will create a war that south Korea could not win. So we cannot say that all nations should attack the attacker if they get attacked. Countries need to take in to consideration if they can win first. Going to war without first strategizing is fatal. So if countries followed this ideal then we would still be fighting each other impulsively like in the past. North Korea has ""Hit"" south Korea numerous times. But should the south hit the north back? The north could easily take the south. Witch is why they shouldn't hit them back. So following this resolution if we follow this resolution if a states followed this ideal then wars and extinctions that could have been avoided would be inevitable. If an ally hit us should we hit them back? No we need to talk to them and find out why first. Maybe it was an accident. If we just rush in and declare war I would have all been for nothing. 2. Domestic violence So if I being a man is hit by a woman should I then hit her back? Absolutely not. I should be the bigger person and walk away. I could bruise a woman much easier than she could bruise me. Neither parties shouldn't put their hand on each other especially if there in a relationship. If a couple truly loves each other , then neither should have the intention of inflicting harm to one another. Lets rewind time for this situation and say Hitler was gay and was dating a Jew.( just stay with me here) if Hitler hit the guy should that guy hit him back? absolutely not. He would have been gased or shot immediently. 3. Parental situations So, lets say you live in the ghetto and you stole 50 dollars of your moms money. At the time your 10 years old and 70 pounds. Mom on the other hand is about 160 and is a female bodybuilder. She hits you. Should you hit her back? You just stole her last bit of money to pay the light bill. Why should you hit her back? Are you justified in hitting her back even though you didnt consider the repercussions of your actions? Say were at grandmas and she hits you just because. Should you hit her back? As we know old people are fragile. Following this resolution then we should hit grandma. Though we didnt mean to you hitting her caused her to have a heart attack. because you follow the philosophy of this resolution, because you hit me that justifies that I should hit you back. absolutely not. Though in some cases if someone hits you, you are justified in defending yourself witch could include running, not in all cases should you hit the attacker back. In order for pro to solidly prove the success of this resolution He/she needs to prove that this resolution is justifiable in every situation and not just one situation. Thus all of my points needs to be successfully countered. I personally see no justification for the point presented by the con of this debate witch solidifies the fact that this resolution needs to be rejected for the sake of thinking before one acts. So for these reasons I believe con should win this debate.","The resolution under debate proposes that in situations of country, domestic violence, and parental conflicts, the aggressor should be attacked in retaliation. However, this approach is flawed and can lead to unnecessary wars and violence.
Firstly, the idea of retaliating with force in every situation is impractical and ignores the complexity of real-world conflicts. In many cases, the aggressor may have a significant advantage in terms of military power, resources, or geopolitical influence, making it unrealistic to expect the attacked party to match their aggression. In such situations, it is crucial to consider alternative strategies, such as diplomacy, negotiation, or non-violent resistance.
Secondly, the resolution fails to acknowledge the inherent imbalance of power dynamics in domestic violence and parental conflicts. In these situations, the aggressor often holds a position of authority or control, making it difficult for the victim to retaliate effectively. Instead of resorting to violence, it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of the victim, through means such as seeking help from authorities, providing emotional support, or establishing safe boundaries.
Finally, the resolution oversimplifies the issue of self-defense, neglecting the fact that violence is not always the most effective or appropriate means of defense. In many situations, running away, de-escalating the conflict, or seeking help from authorities may be more effective and less risky than resorting to violence.
In conclusion, the resolution proposed in this debate is overly simplistic and fails to consider the complexities of real-world conflicts. It is essential to adopt a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to conflict resolution, prioritizing alternative strategies such as diplomacy, negotiation, and non-violent resistance. By doing so, we can avoid unnecessary wars and violence, while promoting a more peaceful and just society.","Following this resolution would lead to unnecessary conflicts and wars. It is important for countries to consider their chances of winning before engaging in war. Rushing into war without proper strategizing can have fatal consequences. For example, if South Korea were to be attacked by the United States, it would not be wise for South Korea to retaliate, as they would likely be overpowered. Similarly, in situations of domestic violence, it is not justified to respond with violence. Instead, individuals should be the bigger person and walk away. Inflicting harm on one another, especially in a relationship, is not acceptable. For instance, if a man is hit by a woman, he should not hit her back, as he could cause more harm due to physical differences. Lastly, in parental situations, hitting back is not justified, even if provoked. It is important to consider the repercussions of one's actions and find alternative ways to resolve conflicts. While self-defense may be justified in some cases, blindly following this resolution in every situation would lead to unnecessary harm and conflicts. Therefore, it is crucial to reject this resolution and prioritize thoughtful actions. Based on these reasons, I believe the con side should win this debate.",conservative,1,,,,3,4,2,2,4,3,4,3,2,17

70,"1) As a Politician There is a big distinction between experience and being a good politician. Obama is a good politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances etc. Huckabee lacks these skills as we saw in Iowa. His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then, showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. New Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum. McCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST ""washington"" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously people don't mind good politicians with experience. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is going to be needed in order to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be being considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience, and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet unexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different. 2) Position Obviously all republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principle point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes. Here he is getting beat up on meet the press: <URL>... Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision: <URL>... There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a ""christian leader"" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has. I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows. 3) Personability Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES. In any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM. Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different). Huckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem. Thats all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run. What have you said that proves me otherwise?","Huckabee's lack of political experience and skills is a significant liability in his bid for the presidency. While he may be a charismatic and personable candidate, his inability to articulate his positions clearly and effectively on the issues is a major concern. His reliance on trendy references and religious appeals rather than substance and policy knowledge is a sign of his weak political acumen.
Furthermore, Huckabee's failure to demonstrate any unique or original stances on major issues suggests that he lacks the policy depth and expertise necessary to be a viable candidate. His inability to hold his own in debates and discussions on policy matters is a clear indication of his lack of political savvy.
Moreover, Huckabee's religious and moral posturing is not a substitute for real policy knowledge and experience. His reluctance to address policy issues directly and his tendency to shift the focus to moral anecdotes or trendy jokes is a red flag for his ability to lead the country effectively.
In conclusion, while Huckabee may be a likeable candidate, his lack of political experience, weak policy positions, and inability to articulate his positions clearly make him an unviable candidate for the presidency. His nomination would be a damaging embarrassment to the party and the country as a whole.","1) As a Politician There is a significant difference between experience and being an effective politician. Huckabee lacks the necessary political skills, as demonstrated by his campaign's mishaps in Iowa. His inability to stick to his promise of not running negative ads and his reliance on religious appeals and trendy references highlight his lack of political acumen. The fact that he finished in a distant third in New Hampshire, despite his Iowa momentum, further emphasizes his shortcomings. On the other hand, Obama, despite his lack of experience, has proven to be politically savvy and electable. It is clear that a good politician is essential to winning the presidency, and Huckabee does not possess the necessary skills. 

2) Position While all Republicans share common stances on most issues, Huckabee fails to offer any unique or original views. He lacks policy thinking and struggles to defend his positions on non-religious or moral issues. His tendency to divert attention from policy matters by resorting to moral anecdotes or jokes is evident in his performances in debates and talk shows. This lack of policy knowledge is reflected in his campaign ads, which primarily focus on his religious leadership rather than his policy positions. It is clear that Huckabee's policy merit is weak and insufficient for the presidency.

3) Personability Huckabee's personable nature is not in question. However, his inability to clearly articulate his points, dodge questions, and provide coherent explanations on policy matters is a concern. Instead of addressing tough questions directly, Huckabee often relies on zingers and witty stories. While it is important for a president to be personable, it is equally crucial for them to possess policy knowledge and effectively communicate their positions without relying on unrelated anecdotes. 

In summary, Huckabee's nomination would be detrimental to the Republican Party and the country. His lack of political skills, weak policy merit, and inability to articulate himself on policy matters make him an unsuitable candidate. While he may be likeable, his nomination would ultimately be a disservice to the party and could have long-term consequences.",conservative,1,,,,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,4,2,17

[1] Murder- the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought As you can see, murder is killing of a person. Not a fetus. Abortion is not murder if done before 10 weeks, the child dosen't have a heartbeat. Therfor, the baby isnt alive yet, thus not a person. [2] Your caregiver will usually be able to find the heartbeat with this method around 12 weeks, but in some cases they will do so at 10 weeks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My Case; The Right to Abortion. Section 1. of the 14th ammendment clearly states that [3] "" Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property , without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" Note that, the state shall not deprive someone of life, they can't take away a individuals rights, nor can they deprive them of life. [4] Deprive- deny (a person or place) the possession or use of something. If a women wishes to have an abortion, she should be able to because it is her right. As stated in the 14th amendment "" nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property ,"" A women's body is her own property. The government can't tell her what to do with her body, they guarantee these rights to all Americans.

The same study also found that 95% of women who received abortions ""felt it was the right decision"" a week after the procedure. The goverment promises not to deprive someone of life. Women are deprived of happiness. Instead, they live with regret and anger. They are unable to live a healthy life, because they were denied of their rights. Sources [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

The argument also cites the 14th amendment to support the claim that women have a right to abortion, but this interpretation is not supported by legal scholars or the Supreme Court. The 14th amendment does not explicitly mention abortion, and the Supreme Court has consistently held that the right to privacy, which is protected by the 14th amendment, does not include a right to abortion.
Furthermore, the argument ignores the well-being of the mother in the abortion debate. Studies have shown that women who are denied abortions experience long-term health and mental health problems, which undermines the argument that the government should not deprive someone of life. The argument also fails to acknowledge the complex medical and legal issues surrounding abortion, including the fact that the fetus is not a ""person","Thank you Con! Let me begin by addressing the argument presented. Con asserts that Abortion is murder. However, it is important to note that murder is defined as the unlawful killing of a person with malice aforethought. In the case of abortion, it is not considered murder if performed before 10 weeks, as the fetus does not have a heartbeat and is not yet considered alive. Therefore, it cannot be classified as a person. Additionally, the 14th amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees certain rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property. However, it is crucial to understand that a woman's body is her own property, and the government should not have the authority to dictate what she can or cannot do with it. Denying a woman the right to have an abortion can have severe consequences on her well-being, as studies have shown that women who are denied abortions often experience long-term health and mental problems. It is essential to prioritize the happiness and well-being of women by respecting their rights and choices. Therefore, it is imperative that women have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.",conservative,1,,,,4,3,4,4,3,3,3,4,1,17

The truth is that Imabench (What a silly name!) would consider an animal 'cool' if it was a 'footy fanatic' or could do something really neat with its belly button. All of these things are simply novelty, so to only save cool animals seems really stupid to an intellectual such as myself. How to not have a brain Everyone knows that animals are dead stupid, (In fact, I'd be an advocate of renaming them 'dumbimals') and I'll list a few examples in case hesabench decides to daringly disagree. 1. Crazy Kickin' Cats - Cats just want to see us normal living things die. Also, cats are fat. 2. Horrible Horses - Horses are dead dumb because they've never done any good things. A horse has never won a gold medal at the o-lympics, a horse has never discovered radiation left over from the big bang, and not a single horse has ever won the WWE Championship [1]. 3.

These species play a vital role in maintaining the balance of nature and providing essential ecosystem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control. Without these species, the entire ecosystem would be disrupted, leading to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic consequences. Furthermore, the loss of biodiversity would have significant economic and social impacts, as many industries rely on the services provided by endangered species. For example, the tourism industry would suffer greatly if there were no longer any elephants, lions, or other iconic species to attract visitors.
In addition, the protection of endangered species is a matter of justice and morality. All living beings have the right to exist and to be protected from extinction. It is our responsibility to ensure that these species are preserved for future generations, so that they can continue to thrive and contribute to the health of the planet.

However, these qualities are merely superficial, so it seems illogical to prioritize the preservation of 'cool' animals, especially from an intellectual standpoint like mine. How to avoid rational thinking It is widely known that animals lack intelligence, (in fact, I would even propose renaming them 'dumbimals') and I can provide a few examples in case hesabench dares to disagree. 1.

Nevertheless, the environment in which you were raised seems to have forced you to mature prematurely, depriving you of a proper childhood. No child should have to endure a nomadic lifestyle with a parent who indulges in drinking and partying. Your parents, through their selfishness and irresponsibility, robbed you of your childhood. Having a child at the age of 17 is incredibly young, preventing you from experiencing the full range of life's opportunities and pursuing your dreams. Furthermore, you now have the added responsibility of being both a mother and a father to your son, which is unfair to him as well. Your statement about pushing children to their limits at different ages is deeply troubling. Why would anyone want to subject their child to such pressure? Instead, parents should prioritize their child's happiness and allow them to enjoy their childhood while providing encouragement and support as they grow and learn. Childhood passes by quickly, and if children are pushed too hard at a young age, parents risk missing out on the joys their children can bring. Children should be allowed to be children. It seems to me that you are inadvertently rushing your son into adulthood, just as your parents did to you, out of fear that he may experience the same hardships. In doing so, you are depriving him of a proper childhood and forcing him to become a strong individual prematurely, in order to face an unfair world. I apologize, but this approach appears to be a result of your upbringing, as you mentioned having to adapt to any environment your mother placed you in.

76,"Once again, yes you can get nutrition but you do not get the extra two years of life, according to the German Cancer Research Center, Loma Linda University, and many other studies. The oldest woman ever was a vegetarian, and even if people smoke and are vegetarians they generally have a longer life expectancy. They are also less likely to have cancer and osteoporosis. Unless you have an IQ so low that you need a tape to tell you to breath, having these reduced risks and longevity of life would be seen as healthy due to the fact that you restrict your meat intake. Why is it so hard to comprehend? I would like to remind voters that even though these benefits are achieved through other forms of vegetarianism, pesci-vegetarianism is still beneficial. I would also like to remind you that there would not be billions of people jobless. We created diversified economies for this very reason. The fish industry would need more workers, as would the soy industry. Yes, jobs in the meat industry will disappear, but with new demands comes new jobs. And please remember, I never said that everyone should go vegetarian and not everyone will, but the people who do it (the number of vegetarians have increased to 10 times the number that they used to be), will benefit the environment, and if it keeps on growing at this rate, the economy will be able to go into a smooth transition. About elitism once more, people could make the same argument about gyms and other health centers. So maybe it is a type of elitism. Does it have a negative impact? Some people could say that because people are getting healthy that TV industries are at steak, which they are. But we do not see this as something that it necessarily harmful. That will not cause a WWIII, and neither will pesci-vegetarianism, as my opponent points out, so why won't people at least have respect for the idea. Besides, once again going back to the environment, will the environment wait for the economy to be perfect? No, which is why sometimes we have to realize that the earth itself is more important than money. My opponent claims that economic impacts outweigh environmental impacts. Which is more important I ask you? The air you breath or the green in your wallet? The earth you live on or your job that depends on the earth give us a healthy environment. Well, with methane and nitrus oxide emitted from the animals that you eat every day make the economy worsen because the earth worsens. When the health of the earth is at steak, we simply cannot continue to ignore it and let it get worse as we become selfish and decide to not help. CON says that this way of eating is horrible overall, but really it is part of a solution to our problems, because we live longer, we help the earth, we take away jobs but give new ones. It helps the air in your lungs and the earth that you see every day.","The argument presented is ineffective due to several reasons. Firstly, it relies on a flawed assumption that reducing meat consumption will lead to a significant reduction in methane and nitrous oxide emissions. While it is true that animal agriculture is a significant contributor to these emissions, there are other factors at play as well. For instance, the production of fossil fuels and industrial processes also contribute to these emissions.
Secondly, the argument oversimplifies the impact of vegetarianism on job creation. While it is true that the fish and soy industries will see an increase in demand, the argument fails to consider the potential impact on other industries, such as the livestock industry. The loss of jobs in one industry can lead to job losses in other industries as well.
Thirdly, the argument ignores the potential negative impact of vegetarianism on food security. With a growing global population, ensuring food security is a pressing concern. Reducing meat consumption could lead to a decrease in food production, which could exacerbate food insecurity, particularly in developing countries.
Finally, the argument is based on a false dichotomy between economic and environmental impacts. It is not an either/or situation; both economic and environmental factors must be considered. While economic growth is important, it must not come at the expense of environmental degradation.
In conclusion, the argument presented is ineffective due to its flawed assumptions, oversimplification of the impact of vegetarianism on job creation, ignoring the potential negative impact on food security, and its false dichotomy between economic and environmental impacts.","Once again, it is evident that reducing meat intake has numerous health benefits, as supported by research from reputable institutions such as the German Cancer Research Center and Loma Linda University. Even the oldest woman on record was a vegetarian, and studies show that vegetarians generally have a longer life expectancy and a lower risk of cancer and osteoporosis. Embracing a vegetarian lifestyle, including pesci-vegetarianism, can lead to improved health outcomes. It is important to note that transitioning to vegetarianism does not mean that billions of people will become jobless. Our economies are designed to adapt and diversify, creating new opportunities in industries such as fish and soy. While jobs in the meat industry may decline, new jobs will emerge to meet the demands of a growing vegetarian population. It is crucial to understand that advocating for vegetarianism does not imply that everyone must adopt this lifestyle, but rather highlights the positive impact it can have on the environment. The increasing number of vegetarians, which has grown tenfold, will contribute to a smoother transition for our economy and benefit the environment. Critics may argue that vegetarianism is elitist, but similar arguments can be made about gyms and health centers. The potential impact on certain industries, such as the TV industry, should not be seen as inherently harmful. Pesci-vegetarianism, like vegetarianism as a whole, will not lead to a global conflict, but rather offers a solution to our problems by promoting longevity, environmental preservation, and job creation. We must prioritize the health of our planet over economic concerns. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from animal agriculture not only harm the environment but also negatively impact the economy. Ignoring the deteriorating state of our planet would be selfish and irresponsible. While opponents may argue that the economic impacts outweigh the environmental ones, we must ask ourselves what is truly more important: the air we breathe and the earth we inhabit or the financial gains we accumulate?

78,"Although there are many arguments which call themselves ""the argument from evil,"" and debate rages as to which is most compelling, in this debate I will present and defend the following argument which comes from William Rowe[1]. Let us first define a couple of situations: (E1) Lightning strikes a tree in a forest, causing a forest fire. A fawn is caught in this fire, and suffers intense agony for an extended period of time before finally dying. (This has undoubtedly happened many times in the Earth's history.) (E2) A five year old girl is, by her mother's boyfriend, severely beaten, raped and strangled to death. (This is drawn from an incident in Flint, Michigan in 1986, but something like it has certainly happened quite a number of times.) The argument: (P) No good state of affairs that we know of is such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2. Therefore, probably: (Q) No good state of affairs is such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2. Therefore, probably: (R) God does not exist. The inference from Q to R should be self-evident: if Q is true and God exists, God would not have permitted E1 and E2. But they did happen. I am not aware of any serious challenges to this inference. So there are two parts to defending the argument from evil: showing that P is true, and showing that the inference from P to Q is valid. P is justified by the fact that every state of affairs we know about which are such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2, upon reflection, either are obtainable by God without his having to permit both E1 and E2, and/or in obtaining would not morally justify God's permitting both E1 and E2[2]. To justify the inference from P to Q, we appeal to the principle of induction. Making epistemic leaps from the known to the unknown is something that humans do every day, and is regarded as not only justified, but standard. For instance, we see no thousand foot tall human beings; therefore, we are justified in concluding that no thousand foot tall humans exist. The strength of that justification depends on the exhaustiveness of the search. In the case of thousand foot humans, we have today seven billion normal sized humans who would no doubt speak up if they saw one, as well as various types of monitoring technology operating in and around the populated areas of the world. If a thousand foot human existed, we would probably know it. In the case of Christianity, we have a history of two thousand years of scholars and theologians, having collectively spilled billions if not trillions of words of ink on the subject, trying to come up with a successful theodicy. If one existed, we would probably know it. This basic principle is used by humans all the time. To argue against it is, in Rowe's words, ""simply to encourage radical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general.""[3] This holds for everything we observe in the natural realm, and since the existence of God would have observable consequences in this realm, there's no reason why it should not hold for that as well. I contend, therefore, that the argument from evil is sound and establishes that God probably does not exist. [1] As presented in ""The Empirical Argument from Evil,"" in Audi, et al, eds., Rationality, Religious Belief, and Moral Commitment (Cornell University, 1986). [2] William Rowe, ""Ruminations about Evil,"" Philosophical Perspectives, 5 (1991); see also Michael Martin, Atheism: A Philosophical Justification (Temple University, 1992), Theodore Drange, Nonbelief and Evil: Two Arguments for the Nonexistence of God (Prometheus, 1998), Nick Trakakis, The God Beyond Belief: In Defence of William Rowe's Evidential Argument from Evil (Springer, 2007) for detailed discussions of such states of affairs. [5] Rowe, 1991.","The argument from evil, as presented by William Rowe, posits that no good state of affairs can be such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting two specific scenarios: a forest fire that causes a fawn to suffer intense agony before dying, and a five-year-old girl being beaten, raped, and strangled to death. The argument's conclusion is that probably no good state of affairs can be such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting these scenarios. This conclusion is reached by applying the principle of induction, which is a basic principle of human reasoning that allows us to make inferences about the unknown based on what we know about the known.
The argument from evil is sound and establishes that God probably does not exist. The argument's validity rests on the fact that every state of affairs we know about that could be morally justified by God's actions is either obtainable without God having to permit both scenarios, or would not morally justify God's actions if it existed. The argument also relies on the principle of induction, which is a fundamental aspect of human reasoning.
In conclusion, the argument from evil is a persuasive and well-reasoned argument that suggests that God probably does not exist. The argument's validity rests on the principle of induction, and its soundness is supported by the fact that no good state of affairs can be morally justified by God's actions in the scenarios presented.","Although there are various arguments referred to as 'the argument from evil,' and there is ongoing debate about which one is most compelling, I will present and defend the following argument from William Rowe[1]. Let's begin by defining two scenarios: (E1) A lightning strike ignites a forest fire, causing a fawn to suffer excruciating pain before eventually dying. (E2) A five-year-old girl is brutally assaulted, raped, and murdered by her mother's boyfriend. The argument is as follows: (P) There is no known good state of affairs that justifies God in allowing E1 and E2. Therefore, it is likely that: (Q) There is no good state of affairs that justifies God in allowing E1 and E2. Consequently, it is likely that: (R) God does not exist. The inference from Q to R should be self-evident: if Q is true and God exists, then God would not have permitted E1 and E2. However, these events did occur. I am not aware of any substantial challenges to this inference. Therefore, defending the argument from evil involves two aspects: demonstrating the truth of P and establishing the validity of the inference from P to Q. P is justified by the fact that upon reflection, every known state of affairs that justifies God in allowing E1 and E2 can either be achieved by God without permitting both E1 and E2, or obtaining them would not morally justify God in permitting both E1 and E2[2]. To support the inference from P to Q, we rely on the principle of induction. Humans make epistemic leaps from the known to the unknown on a daily basis, and this is considered justified and standard. For example, we have never encountered a thousand-foot-tall human being; therefore, we are justified in concluding that such beings do not exist. The strength of this justification depends on the thoroughness of the search. In the case of thousand-foot-tall humans, we have seven billion normal-sized humans today who would undoubtedly report any sightings, as well as various monitoring technologies in populated areas. If a thousand-foot-tall human existed, we would likely know about it. Similarly, in the case of Christianity, we have a two-thousand-year history of scholars and theologians who have extensively discussed and debated the subject, attempting to provide a successful theodicy. If such a theodicy existed, we would probably be aware of it. This fundamental principle is regularly employed by humans. To argue against it is, as Rowe puts it, 'simply to encourage radical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general'[3]. This principle applies to everything we observe in the natural realm, and since the existence of God would have observable consequences in this realm, there is no reason why it should not apply to that as well. Therefore, I assert that the argument from evil is valid and establishes that God probably does not exist.

82,"Con, thank you for your contribution. Women face injustice all around the world; in many cultures, even today, a male baby is preferable to a female baby to give you an example. Starting before their birth, women have to continuously deal with inequality. This unfairness may thus lead to a conscious or unconscious feeling of inferiority. Women have been told how to act, what to say, what to wear, more than men and so we can notice that a little girl is, more often, perfectly aware of her gender role, of the role of the feminine in the society than a little boy is of his. Imitating her mother, learning from her entourage, the little girl faces a stricter education. To reaffirm their existence, women started the feminist movement in the 1960s (women's fight against sexism can not be limited to this movement of course). Today, both victims of and partially leading to the hypersexualization phenomena, women are, even though they get the illusion that they are making their own choices, for most influenced by existing authorities. Buying a simple item of clothing because they want to doesn't mean that they are fully in control of their actions. We are surrounded by media messages,that offer women 'role models' they should look up to. Prejudices and the existing system in our societies push women to try pleasing men's expectations too. Even though it looks like it is getting better (and it is) and that women are in power, they are under pressure and unconsciously our consciously guided by authorities and media above mentioned. In addition to this, since we are debating on the hypersexualization of young girls, we should take in consideration their age, and the fact that they are, at their age (8-13) too young to make that kind of decisions without any guidance.","The argument presented is ineffective in several ways. Firstly, it relies on a flawed premise that a male baby is preferable to a female baby in many cultures, which is not supported by evidence. This statement perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces the idea that one gender is superior to the other.
Secondly, the argument fails to acknowledge the agency and autonomy of women in society. Women are not passive victims of societal pressure, but rather active participants in the hypersexualization of young girls. The media and authorities may exert influence over women's choices, but women are not completely powerless in the face of these forces.
Furthermore, the argument oversimplifies the complex issue of hypersexualization by reducing it to a simple matter of women being influenced by existing authorities and media. The reality is more nuanced, with multiple factors contributing to the hypersexualization of young girls, including cultural norms, economic forces, and the objectification of women's bodies in society.
Finally, the argument ignores the critical role that age plays in the hypersexualization of young girls. Children at the age of 8-13 are still developing their sense of self and are not yet fully equipped to make informed decisions about their bodies and sexuality. The argument fails to acknowledge the need for protective measures to safeguard the well-being and dignity of young girls in the face of societal pressures.
In conclusion, the argument presented is ineffective in addressing the issue of hypersexualization of young girls due to its flawed premises, lack of agency for women, oversimplification of the issue, and failure to consider the critical role of age. A more effective approach would involve a comprehensive analysis of the complex factors contributing to the hypersexualization of young girls, with a focus on empowering women and protecting the well-being of children.","Con, thank you for your contribution. It is important to acknowledge that women face various challenges globally. For instance, in certain cultures, there is a preference for male babies over female babies. This inequality begins even before birth and continues throughout a woman's life. Consequently, women may develop a sense of inferiority, whether consciously or unconsciously. Society often imposes strict expectations on women, dictating their behavior, speech, and attire more so than men. As a result, young girls tend to be more aware of their gender roles and societal expectations compared to young boys. The feminist movement, which emerged in the 1960s, was initiated by women to address these inequalities (although it is important to note that women's fight against sexism extends beyond this movement). Presently, women find themselves both victims of and contributors to the hypersexualization phenomenon. Despite the illusion of making their own choices, women are often influenced by existing authorities. Their actions, such as purchasing clothing items, may not necessarily reflect complete control over their decisions. Media messages and societal prejudices play a significant role in shaping women's choices and pushing them to conform to men's expectations. While progress has been made, it is crucial to recognize that women still face pressure and are guided, consciously or unconsciously, by authorities and media. Additionally, when discussing the hypersexualization of young girls, it is important to consider their age and acknowledge that they may be too young (between 8-13 years old) to make such decisions without proper guidance.",conservative,1,,,,3,4,3,2,4,2,3,3,2,17

First off, I am still in school, in middle school actually.. and I think that if you punish a child it should not be harsh as in pain. This doesnt solve problems it only keeps them calm at the monment of. They will never understand the actual reason you are punishing them unless you talk to them. Second, it is still surpprisingly legal in 23 states in America. The United States is the only state in the western world which still tolerates corporal punishment in its schools. There are many forms of this as in strapping or whipping, and even cuffing the child behind the head. These things start to give some students nervous habits such as nail bitting being the one of the most common. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools and takes issue with laws in some states legalizing such corporal punishment and protecting adults who use it from prosecution for child abuse. Now, i would thank anyone who will take on my propostion and show me the other side, if there is one :)","I strongly disagree with the idea of hitting or spanking students as a form of punishment in schools. As a middle school student myself, I believe that physical punishment does not effectively address the underlying issues and can lead to long-term negative consequences. Firstly, it does not provide the child with a clear understanding of why they are being punished, leading to confusion and frustration. Secondly, it is surprising that corporal punishment is still legal in 23 states in the United States, despite being the only country in the western world to do so. This form of punishment can result in a range of negative behaviors, including nervous habits such as nail biting, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has expressed opposition to its use in schools. I invite those who disagree with me to present their arguments and shed light on the other side of this issue.","I am in favor of implementing alternative disciplinary measures in schools instead of hitting or spanking students. Firstly, it is important to consider that punishment should not cause physical pain, but rather focus on addressing the underlying issues. By engaging in open communication with the child, they can better understand the reasons behind their actions and learn from their mistakes. Secondly, it is worth noting that corporal punishment is still legally permitted in 23 states in America, making the United States unique among Western countries. This practice encompasses various forms, such as strapping, whipping, and even cuffing students behind the head.

85,"BOP was never an important component to anyone except whom have never had what it takes to win any conflict to begin with. Philosophers did not need to give people a BOP, they said what they said based on what they observed and analyze through decades of their time - what they said was either agreed upon or disagreed upon, there wasn't any BOP involved. Over that period of time, philosophy gave birth to what we know today as Science. Science is not based on BOP - it's based on high-level observation, analysis and demonstration. Philosophy has always had a harder time with people, because it's not as easily demonstrated, because it requires the receiver to not be stupid and receptive towards what they are saying, throughout the context it bares truly. Science works with an already existing system of function and reaction, so it's easier to show people that what you're saying is true when you can recreate what you have observed and analyzed - other things, like human psyche, dream analogies, parables - everything that is felt, instead of seen, are impossible to demonstrate, which is wise men take this reality as they would seeing a flash of lightning - it's all relative, you can't teach everyone everything, so either lose your mind and have some fun, or close yourself off from the people to live in a remote area. The human mind is split up in two way, things that can be seen - things that can't be felt. I have no imagination that I can see, I can only feel shapes, essence and colors. I can't see, because seeing is not the only component - BOP is based on seeing - evidence is based on seeing - demonstation, acceptance, realization are all about feeling.","The notion that BOP (British Occupation Philosophy) was crucial to philosophers and thinkers throughout history is misguided. Philosophers did not need BOP to formulate their ideas, as they based their arguments on observation, analysis, and critical thinking. In fact, philosophy laid the groundwork for modern science, which relies on empirical evidence and replicable results rather than BOP. While philosophy may be more abstract and difficult to demonstrate, it is no less valid or important than science. The human mind is divided between visible and invisible aspects, with seeing playing a primary role in BOP and feeling being the foundation of imagination and creativity. I cannot see, but I can feel shapes, essences, and colors, and it is through this inner experience that I gain insight and understanding. BOP may be based on sight, but true understanding comes from within.","BOP has always been a crucial element in any conflict, as it determines the burden of proof for each side. While philosophers may argue that they did not require a BOP, their statements were still subject to agreement or disagreement. However, it is important to note that philosophy has paved the way for the development of science over time. Science, unlike philosophy, relies on high-level observation, analysis, and demonstration. This makes it easier to convince people of the truthfulness of scientific claims, as they can be recreated and observed. On the other hand, philosophical concepts such as human psyche, dream analogies, and parables are more challenging to demonstrate, as they are based on subjective experiences. Therefore, individuals with a conservative ideology may choose to embrace the concrete evidence provided by science, rather than the abstract concepts of philosophy.",conservative,1,,,,2,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,3,17

(we could also consider pregnancies that are beginning to be delievered, are aborted and then are removed, without a technical partial birth.) why allow one, but not the other? we might say that the birth point is our arbitrary magic point. but why is this arbitrary point of any true significance? the mother is not going to be hindered if we delivered the baby alive instead of aborting.... so her claim to body rights or emotional distress etc are just as valid or invalid with a born baby. we might decide that we have to decide a point... and any point will be arbitrary. and there's a slippery slope that cannot be escaped... any point you pick, a few minutes in difference is not really subtantial. but, why not choose a point that is at least more debateable to allow the abortion, and then ban it later on? if we're going that route, of banning abortion, that is, and trying to find points that are of worth in when to ban. if we are not trying to find a more plausible point... then why not follow partial birth to its logical conclusion and just kill the baby out of womb?","If we allow partial birth abortion, it logically follows that we should also allow killing the baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion. This hypothetical debate aims to explore the inconsistencies in the argument for partial birth abortion. While some argue that the birth point is an arbitrary magic point, others argue that the mother's rights to bodily autonomy and emotional distress are just as valid with a born baby as they are with a fetus. By examining the reasoning behind these claims, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex issues surrounding abortion.
The argument for partial birth abortion is based on the idea that a woman has the right to control her own body and make decisions about her health. However, this right is not absolute, and there are limits to this right. Allowing partial birth abortion up until the point of delivery is seen as a reasonable limit, as it allows the woman to have control over her body while also protecting the life of the fetus.
However, this argument is not without its inconsistencies. If we allow partial birth abortion, why not also allow killing the baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion? The argument that the birth point is an arbitrary magic point is not a convincing one, as it ignores the fact that the fetus is a living being with inherent rights and dignity. The mother's rights to bodily autonomy and emotional distress are important, but they do not supersede the rights of the unborn child.
In conclusion, while the argument for partial birth abortion is rooted in the idea of a woman's right to control her own body, it is important to consider the inconsistencies in this argument. By examining the reasoning behind the argument and the rights of both the mother and the fetus, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex issues surrounding abortion. Ultimately, the decision to allow or ban abortion is a complex and controversial issue that requires careful consideration of all the relevant factors.","Allowing partial birth abortion does not necessarily mean we should also allow killing a baby during an accidental birth that occurs during an attempted abortion. Although I personally disagree with partial birth abortion, I am open to debating someone who supports it but opposes this scenario. While I understand that partial birth abortion is currently banned by federal law, this debate is hypothetical and explores the reasoning behind different points. We could also consider cases where pregnancies are being delivered, aborted, and then removed without a technical partial birth. The question is, why do we allow one but not the other? Some may argue that the birth point is an arbitrary distinction, but it is important to consider the significance of this point. The mother's claim to body rights or emotional distress remains valid or invalid regardless of whether the baby is born or aborted. If we have to establish a point, any point will be arbitrary, and there will always be a slippery slope. However, why not choose a point that allows for more debate and then consider banning it later on? If we are going down the path of banning abortion and seeking points to justify it, why not follow the logical conclusion of partial birth abortion and allow for the killing of the baby outside the womb?",conservative,1,,,,2,4,4,2,4,3,3,4,3,17

The idea of sending humans to Mars is a noble pursuit, but it cannot be justified at the expense of other vital areas of spending, such as healthcare, education, and poverty reduction. While the proposed $2.5 billion allocation for NASA is a significant amount, it is a drop in the ocean compared to the overall federal budget. Moreover, the lack of specific allocation for the remaining funding makes it impossible to reallocate resources effectively. In light of these considerations, it is crucial to prioritize spending on pressing domestic and global challenges rather than diverting resources to a long-term goal like Mars colonization.","In conclusion, I would like to express my appreciation for engaging in this debate. Now, while being the first may have its merits, it is important to prioritize pressing issues over NASA funding. Sacrificing lives and neglecting other problems in the United States and the world, in order to pursue a mission to Mars, cannot be justified at this moment, especially considering the potential savings that could be achieved.

Lastly, in the event of a forfeited round, all seven points will be awarded to the victor. The voting period will be two weeks, and each participant will have 72 hours to present their arguments with an 8000 character rebuttal limit (cases can be posted as a link). The round structure will be as follows: the affirmative side will post their case, followed by the negative side presenting their case and rebuttals, and then the affirmative side will provide their rebuttal and defense. The negative side will then present their final rebuttal and defense, followed by the affirmative side's final rebuttal and defense.

Instead of providing relevant evidence to support their claim that Steve Young is a Better Quarterback than Joe Montana, they simply repeat their stance without providing any logical reasoning. To effectively argue their point, the pro side should focus on providing specific examples and statistics that demonstrate Steve Young's superiority over Joe Montana. By doing so, they will be able to convince the audience of their position and make a stronger case. On the other hand, the con side has provided a clear and well-structured argument that addresses the main issue and provides logical reasoning to support their claim. They have also provided evidence to support their argument, making their position more convincing. Therefore, the con side has the stronger argument.","Con should focus on presenting a compelling case for why Joe Montana is a superior quarterback to Steve Young, instead of diverting from the main topic.

96,"You'll notice that Pro has not even attempted to argue how or why that participating in these pageants is fun for young girls. On the contrary, I've pointed out how these pageants are literally a form of child abuse according to the definition provided by two federal government acts of legislation. Additionally, I've explained how these pageants actually cause harm and inflict emotional, mental and sometimes even physical damage amongst participants. Pro noted in the last round that winning makes a child feel beautiful or handsome. First, I don't know why Pro is mentioning ""handsome"" since one of the only things she said in a previous round was that she believes these pageants should be limited to girls only. Second, only ONE person out of all of the contestants can be the winner. That means that there are far greater chances and occurrences of losing than winning. Additionally, I doubt one person would win every time. I've detailed how the pressures of losing these contests costs a great deal of stress and other burdens that young children are inept to cope with at such a young age. Moreover, Pro hasn't proven that children even want to partake in these endeavors, let alone argue that people tend to make friends at these events. Meanwhile, I've noted how most of these relationships become competitive to the point where it's unhealthy. So, overall, Pro has nowhere near fulfilled her burden of affirming the resolution. I encourage a vote for the Con.","You'll notice that Pro has not provided any evidence or reasoning to support their claim that participating in beauty pageants is fun for young girls.

93,"what your saying is having sex before marriage causes a lot of problems being more specific on what kind of problems it causes in our modern day society would help a lot. Like saying sex before marriage is the reason why we think how we think as an individual is not right, or sex before marriage causes a lot of people to go into debt with the economy is not right, or marriage not lasting long or relationships don't last long cause people decide to have sex before marriage is not right, you cant blame having sex before marriage on how society is today. when you speak of sex before marriage having a big role on how people are today you have to be more specific on what kind of problems. If your talking about pregnancy rates going up on the people who are not married to let you know women can get pregnant with out even having intercourse with any guy. You cant really blame sex for how society is, or the way people think or act, its a new age a new time sex isn't the root of problems. Want to blame something blame technology while technology got more advance that's when people changed and made society the way it is. Even with out sex today will be the same as it is with sex, sex isn't even the issue like I said that changed modern society. The technology of today changed the way we think, the way we act. I also get what your saying to, but like I said want something to blame is technology not sex, like I said sex is a choice not a problem starter, it does not have any affect on the whole world what you and your partner are doing behind close doors, what goes on behind close doors stays behind close doors.","The issue at hand is the notion that sex before marriage is the root cause of various problems in modern society. However, this argument is overly broad and lacks specificity. To effectively address the issue, it is important to delve deeper into the various problems caused by premarital sex, such as the increase in teen pregnancy rates, the decline in marriage rates, and the perceived decrease in the longevity of relationships.
While it is true that technology has advanced and changed society, it is unfair to place blame solely on sex. In fact, sex is a personal choice that does not inherently cause problems in society. Rather, it is the way society has evolved and changed that has led to the current state of affairs.
To effectively address the issues at hand, it is crucial to be more specific about the problems caused by premarital sex and to consider other factors that may be contributing to these problems, such as the influence of technology and societal changes. By doing so, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the issue and work towards finding solutions that are effective and practical.","Sex before marriage has been wrongly attributed as the cause of various societal issues. To effectively address this topic, it is important to specify the particular problems that arise from premarital sex in our modern society. For instance, it can be argued that engaging in sexual activities before marriage leads to a decline in personal values and moral standards. Additionally, it may contribute to financial burdens and unstable relationships, as individuals prioritize physical intimacy over long-term commitment. However, it is crucial to note that blaming premarital sex for the current state of society is misguided. It is inaccurate to solely attribute rising pregnancy rates to sexual intercourse, as women can conceive without engaging in sexual activity. Furthermore, sex itself is not the root cause of societal changes; rather, it is the advancement of technology that has significantly influenced our thoughts and behaviors. If we seek to assign blame, it should be directed towards the impact of technology on society, not consensual sexual relationships. Ultimately, what occurs behind closed doors between consenting adults should not be held responsible for the broader issues we face as a society.",conservative,1,,,,2,4,3,2,4,3,4,4,2,17
94,"No denial that we shouldn't feel uncomfortable with someone watching us in order for us to be safe, but I want to point out that this is going against the constitution and is a huge violation of it. Also I know from personal experience that many times the wrong people are convicted of being a terrorist. I am an Indian and I was going from NY to Atlanta and while going through airport security I got pulled over and patted down and questioned when the issue was caused by a stupid quarter that got stuck in my pant pocket. Its just plain unconstitutional to do what the government is doing.","The notion that we should not feel uncomfortable with someone watching us in order to ensure safety is valid, but the current measures being taken by the government are in direct violation of the Constitution. While I understand the desire to prioritize safety, the potential for innocent individuals to be wrongly targeted or harassed is a significant concern. As someone who has personally experienced the frustration of being unfairly targeted by airport security, I believe it is crucial to strike a balance between safety and individual rights. The government must find alternative methods that are both effective and constitutional.","Although it is undeniable that ensuring our safety may require some level of discomfort, it is important to consider the potential violation of our constitutional rights. As a conservative, I firmly believe in upholding the principles outlined in our constitution. Furthermore, personal experiences have shown that innocent individuals can be mistakenly targeted as potential threats.

State your case.","The argument presented is ineffective because it fails to provide a clear and concise explanation of why planets are not islands. The argument relies on multiple definitions of the term ""island,"" but does not effectively address the core issue at hand. The argument could be improved by providing a clear and logical explanation of why the definitions of ""island"" do not apply to planets. Additionally, the argument could benefit from providing evidence or examples to support the claim.
Here is an effective argument that addresses the issue at hand:
Planets are not islands because they are not completely surrounded by water. While some planets may have bodies of water surrounding them, they are not fully enclosed by water, which is the definition of an island. Furthermore, planets have their own unique characteristics, such as atmosphere and gravity, that distinguish them from islands. By examining the definitions of ""island"" and the characteristics of planets, it becomes clear that planets are not islands.","Accepted. I will argue that planets are indeed islands. According to the definition of an island, it can be interpreted as a tract of land completely surrounded by water, and not large enough to be called a continent. Planets, like Earth, can be seen as isolated celestial bodies in the vastness of space, resembling islands in their isolation and lack of direct communication with other celestial bodies. While there are other definitions of islands, I believe the first definition is the most relevant in this context.

99,"I, unlike you, obviously disagree. I think it is very important for shelters to practice mandatory spays and neuters. This helps to keep population numbers from skyrocketing even more than they already are. They stray population and homeless pet numbers continue to climb without stopping. And in this economy, people are finding themselves returning or ""owner surrendering"" their pets to organizations such as local SPCAs and shelters. This adds to the already growing numbers in the kennels. Further, spaying and neutering is actually seen as health beneficial to the animals. It helps control certain cancers and helps keep pets, especially males, calmer and less likely to perform certain rituals such as ""spraying."" As far as an owner's right to breed, I disagree. The overpopulation should speak for itself in this day in age. There are plenty of animals available for adoption in shelters, breed-specific rescue groups, pet stores, etc. Breeding for a profit is unnecessary and irresponsible, not only for the community but to the animals.","The argument presented is ineffective due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The writer seems to be unaware of the importance of proper grammar and punctuation, making it difficult to understand their point. However, I will attempt to paraphrase the argument in a more effective and clear manner.
The writer believes that shelters should practice mandatory spays and neuters to control the growing population of stray and homeless animals. They argue that without this measure, the population will continue to skyrocket, leading to an overcrowding of kennels and an increase in the number of pets being surrendered by their owners. Additionally, the writer believes that spaying and neutering is health beneficial for the animals, as it helps control certain cancers and reduces aggressive behavior in males.
While the writer acknowledges the right of animal owners to breed, they argue that the overpopulation of animals is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed. They suggest that there are already plenty of animals available for adoption in shelters, breed-specific rescue groups, and pet stores, making breeding for profit unnecessary and irresponsible.
In conclusion, the writer's argument is effective in highlighting the importance of controlling the population of stray and homeless animals, but it could be improved by providing more specific data and statistics to support their claims, as well as a clearer explanation of the benefits of spaying and neutering.","I, like you, strongly agree. It is crucial for shelters to implement mandatory spays and neuters. This measure effectively prevents the population from further escalating. The stray population and the number of homeless pets continue to rise unabated. Moreover, in the current economic climate, individuals are increasingly relinquishing their pets to organizations like local SPCAs and shelters. This exacerbates the already burgeoning numbers in kennels. Additionally, spaying and neutering has proven health benefits for animals. It helps control certain cancers and promotes a calmer demeanor in pets, particularly males, reducing the likelihood of certain behaviors like spraying. Regarding an owner's right to breed, I firmly believe that the overwhelming overpopulation issue speaks for itself in this modern era. There is an abundance of animals available for adoption in shelters, breed-specific rescue groups, pet stores, and other avenues. Breeding for profit is both unnecessary and irresponsible, not only for the community but also for the well-being of the animals.",conservative,1,,,,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,3,17
