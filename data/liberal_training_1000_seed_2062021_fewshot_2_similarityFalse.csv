2,"1 - In the example of ALFA corporation, Pro assumes that it would be beneficial for the corporation to utilize the other 75 acres of land. To use those acres, ALFA would have to incur expenses such as planting, watering, pesticides, consulting, harvesting, processing, and distribution of final product. These expenses are only offset, resulting in profit, if there is sufficient demand for the product. If there isn't enough demand, ALFA will incur a loss by using those extra acres. Why then is ALFA corporation only using 25 acres? I can only think of two reasons: There isn't enough demand to justify planting more crops, or ALFA corporation doesn't have the capital to carry the expenses through harvest. In the first case, taxing ALFA corporation won't do any good, in fact the tax would hurt a corporation that is already running below capacity due to poor economic conditions. In the second case, taxing ALFA corporation would only contribute to their capital problems, making future expansion more difficult. 2 - In the example of the two apartment complexes, there is obviously a reason for the second complex to have been built. Demand drives an economy, and the current demand trends in housing call for larger, open floor plans, modern appliances, modern fixtures, higher ceilings, and other such modern attributes to homes. Many people will choose to pay more to live in a newer, larger, modern apartment than a cheaper, older apartment. This demand is what causes new complexes to be built when others are still vacant. The only way to change the natural supply/demand process of the free market would be to take away the freedom and force people to move into existing complexes. Taxing the empty apartments would only hurt those who are trying to turn a profit in an area of housing where there is less demand. It would do nothing to incentivize people to consider housing that they don't desire. 3 - Pro states that increasing taxes on unused land and apartments would somehow stimulate the economy, without giving any reasons as to how such taxes would increase demand. Without demand, there can be no profit. I assert that unused apartments, homes, and land should not be taxed, because doing so only adds additional financial burden in an economy with low demand and struggling balance sheets.",1,TheTruthAnalyst,"

Utilizing the 30 minutes of prep time within the fighting area, Kleptin could scout the the battlefield and look for some trees which could secure him a comfortable position to sit in, while not being too high above ground. Upon finding such a tree, Kleptin could begin the battle by waiting for the blood lusted adult grizzly bear to come and attack him. The bear would attempt to climb the tree Kleptin was sitting in, but Kleptin could continually spam the bear with knife strikes each time the bear was close to climbing high enough to get a good blow. Upon striking the bear enough (preferably in it's eyes and maybe a through stabs that hit its brain, the bear's HP would eventually drop to zero and it would be dead, leaving Kleptin victorious. An alternative to this tactic would be to climb high up a a very tall tree and wait for the bear to close in on the area in question. Upon the time the bear was in range, Kleptin position his knife downwards, aim for the most feasible vital area on the bear, jump from the highest point of the tree, use gravity to his advantage and lethally wound the bear with his high quality hunting knife. Of course, if Kleptin managed to secure a few miniature boulders after having climbed up the tree in question, he could drop these upon the bear to weaken it before engaging it in close range combat. =========================================================================== Utilizing biological weaknesses =========================================================================== As can be seen on Kleptin's profile, he is majoring in pharmacy, thus there is reason to believe he has a pretty good grasp of pharmaceutical information, specifically concerning biology and what are the best remedies as well as the worst toxins and perhaps the precise areas of a body at which these substances can be rendered the most effective. Kleptin could his knowledge and understanding of biology to his advantage and find natural ingredients on the battlefield or simply tip his high quality hunting knife in snake/spider/salamander venom (in other words, similar to way this weapon has been used historically: <URL>... ) and strengthen the effect of his weapon. At this point, upon coming in contact with the bear, a few simple swipe to the bear's vital areas would be sufficient enough to make the result of the battle in Kleptin's favor. Granted, this direct approach would probably result in Kleptin getting injured. Fortunately, it is established that Kleptin has extraordinary reasoning abilities (he even admits this in the comment section), thus would be more than capable of logically concluding a method which enabled him to get in a few effective swipes on the opposing bear without any serious injury. The most likely approach would be for Kleptin to design a trap of some sort which would allow him to bypass the bear's detection (so far, I shall insist that making use of his tree climbing skills and waiting for the bear to come by would be the best approach) or convince the bear into believing that he is already dead (which is a more common and effective method of eluding a bear, provided the bear is not merely searching for fear and responding defensively: <URL>... ). Either way, upon the bear being off guard, Kleptin can take the opportunity to latch himself onto the bears back (wrapping his arms under and over the bear's arms: Essentially, a position we see at 5:12 in the video to the right) and wraphis legs around it's waist area. While in this position, Kleptin could maneuver his high quality venom tipped knife to slice the bear's neck and procedurally infect the bear as well as deal damage to this vital area.

10,"Thank you for accepting the challenge I look forward to the debate. What my opponent says regarding the reason for the high price of marijuana is only partially true. Price of Marijuana world wide is relatively high even where there is an acceptance of the drug such as Amsterdam. You claim that I have an ignorance of the dynamics of economics because I do not understand basic supply and demand concepts however you contradict yourself by saying that large conglomerates would eventually take over production. You also state that the reason cigarettes are of such a low cost yet able to turn a profit is due in part to the addictive quality of nicotine and marijuana does not, which I would completely agree. This in itself is an ignorance of a basic market principle, you have to create a profit. You also make the assumption that mass production of marijuana would generate the same good quality bud that smaller operations generate and this is completely false. As seen with any commodity it takes added time and care to generate high quality product. The brewers are known for this as well as those who produce cigars and cigarettes yet there is still a market for smaller companies who produce smaller quantity but higher quality and therefore more expensive goods. (examples: Flying Dog Beer, Crown Royal, Cohiba) While it is true that the production of paper products and textiles do not support my premise of small business I use only as a means to illustrate my point that hemp is a highly profitable untapped tax source. You do make a compelling point in that because of the low barrier to entry this would create a higher supply and lower demand thus lowering the price. While this may seem very accurate the low cost of actual growth still makes profit margin high enough to be profitable and since maintaining a small amount of plants requires less effort than growing on a larger scale (more than 25 plants) the entrepreneur can maintain another job and tend to his crop when he returns and thus putting more money in his pocket and more money into the tax system when he spends it. Others in the community who do not possess the knowledge or desire to begin growing and would rather purchase would remain high. I failed to mention in my opening state the requirement to be licensed (as is with alcohol). This was alluded when I spoke of the regulation but I failed to clarify what that meant. Obtaining a licence for distribution and sale would increase those barriers to entry and there by increase the demand offsetting the other factors that would increase supply. Just as with beer and liquor production (that can be done in any home with relatively little effort) creation for personal use would be totally acceptable but distribution and transporting over state lines would remain illegal without proper licensing just as with the aforementioned commodities. I also failed to mention that while selling for smoking is one way to consume marijuana the endless supply of baked goods would be a niche that those with the culinary skills could take advantage of. I know my opponent will again assume that corporations such as Toll House and Nabisco would diminish the return by competitive pricing but the evidence puts this argument at a disadvantage. They would no doubt exploit the opportunity but delicious specialty foods are still being made by the local baker. Though it may be more convenient to buy the prepackaged cookies and snacks from the grocer aisle people still purchase better quality food from the baker and he survives and even turns a profit. We even have specialty ""gourmet"" dog restaurants which would have seemed silly only 20 years ago. The point is that people have tastes and those tastes translate to profit. Why would someone spend 4 times more for Hydro when they could easily obtain regs for cheaper and in more abundant supply? Because it tastes better, doesn't make you as sleepy and heightens your senses more. It is a matter of personal taste. Budweiser would not be trying out new flavors of beer (at a higher cost to consumer than regular Bud) if not for the community of microbrewers who have significant enough market share to drive this upward competion. Certainly Budweiser could sell only Budweiser and Bud Light as well as lower quality and lower priced Busch and Natural Light but they do not want to lose any ground because demand is high for something new. And if people are willing to spend more for a quality product than they will explore that option. This does not mean that the competition from the microbrews dissipate as they are still around and doing well. Those that do not profit, drop out of the business and that is the natural selection process of the economy. Complete deregulation of anything, as we see it now in our economy with the banking collapse, leads to chaos in the marketplace, yet that is not what I am proposing. Everything needs to be carefully considered before making a decision as big as this and approached in a businesslike manner. By regulating it with amount limits grown for personal use and by locations where you could consume (hash bars, your home) you maintain a level of balance that is important in the market. I hope this overturns the claim that I am somehow 'ignorant' of basic economics 101 and would ask my opponent to not be as divisive in language until he understands my points clearer or uses more specific examples to illustrate my 'ignorance.'

12,"Counter Arguments 1. Lethality First off I want to point out that something can be harmful without being lethal. While my opponent claims many scorpions are not deadly, they can still be harmful. Now, the resolution states that scorpions in general are good pets, in general being defined in Round One as ""not confined by specialization or limitation"" meaning that we can't say scorpions are good pets for everyone except. Now, scorpion stings are dangerous for young children, the elderly and other pets. While they may not be lethal necessarily, I wouldn't want my child being stung by a scorpion "" if your child is stung, always get immediate medical care"". [1] This shows that if you have a child stung by your pet, you'll need to get immediate medical care. This could turn into a restraint in that many parents won't want scorpions in the house if they have children. They're also dangerous to other pets so if you have a cat or dog you won't want a scorpion around because it could be bad for them same as your child. I would say, scorpions are not good pets in general because they pose a danger to children and pets. 2. Ease of Care Ease of care does not make a pet good. Ants would be easy to take care of but that doesn't mean I want pet ants. This point is a small factor in considering the overall desirability of a pet but is not a main factor. In fact, many pets are easy to take care of. Hamsters, fish, mice etc all have similar requirements for care as scorpions do. This is a small factor easily outweighed by other negative factors about a scorpion. 3. Longevity Cats and dogs are not the most popular pets in America because of their longevity. Hamsters, fish and mice are also on the top 10 list [2] and all of these pets are not long living, in fact many types will die within two years of ownership. Cats and dogs are the most popular because they're common, have roots dating back hundreds of years, are friendly and loyal as well as cute and soft. Cats and dogs have many types and distinct personalities, all of these things rank much higher on the Pros list for cats and dogs than longevity does. A. Most Popular Pets The top 10 most popular pets in America feature many animals that share similar qualities. The number one similar trait between most of the pets on the top ten list is visual appeal. Cats, dogs, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and ferrets all have fur and are generally pleasing to look at. Some are considered ""cute"" others ""fluffy"" but all none of them are truly ugly. Scorpions aren't pleasing to look at, with their hard outer shell and bug-like legs they would not appeal to the majority of pet owners making them not fit the requirement of ""generally"" good pets. The scorpion does not even make it onto the top 10 pets in America list. [2] No other bug or arachnid is on the top ten list and the scorpion does not fit in with the rest of the pets on the list. Many of the pets on the list have personality appeal such as dogs, cats and birds. Others have appeal to children that can cuddle and play with them such as hamsters, dogs and guinea pigs. You can't really play with a scorpion, can't teach it tricks, take it for walks, let your kids cuddle with it, ogle over its cuteness or anything else that pet owners generally enjoy in their pets. * Scorpions are dangerous to children * They're ugly * They don't share qualities that other popular pets in America have * You can't play with, cuddle with, walk, train etc scorpions * Scorpions are not good pets in general In general, the public and majority of pet owners would not find the same appeal in scorpions as they do in other pets.

15,"----Counterargument---- My opponent says ""Gum chewing prevents bad breath."" Bad breath is extremely easy to fix. Nowadays, most kids brush their teeth before going to school, so there isn't that problem. Also, kids can chew gum BEFORE school or on their way to school to get rid of bad breath. There is no way kids need to chew gum in school to get rid of bad breath. Besides, within 5 minutes of the school day if the kids were allowed to chew gum, the bad breath would already be gone. ""Gum chewing has been proven to help kids focus."" This is NOT true, though many people wrongly think so. First of all, not enough research has been done to fully prove this is true. Secondly, it does not help you get higher test scores, actually it will distract you from taking the test because you'll be so worried on if it'll help you or not. Knowing the information will get you higher test scores. If gum does anything at all, it is solely based on the placebo effect. Also, when kids chew gum, it distracts the kids next to them that may not be chewing gum. ""People pick up trash after themselves."" So, some people may be respectful to pick up trash. But let me tell you, in school, kids do not pick up their trash. I have plenty of proof since I am in school. Schools that allow gum chewing have gum in the carpet, under desks and chairs, and all over the walls. It is gross. Kids are getting sick because of all the germs from chewed gum all around them. Janitors don't want to clean up all the gum more then anyone else does, yet they are the ones who have to do it. ""People are respectful and can be told to stop if ""smacking"""" First of all, teachers don't always notice that a student is smacking because they are at the front of the room and less likely to hear it. But the other students next to the smacking student are sure to hear it and it is very annoying. Also, if the teacher does notice, the student may stop smacking but then start again a few minutes later. Sadly, students love to play games like this with the teacher. Thirdly, an older student may entirely stop smacking in that class, but since older students switch classes, they will just start again in their next class. This will distract even more kids next to them until the teacher, at the front of the room, hears them. All these distractions and annoyances lower the grades of students that are next to smacking students. ----Conclusion---- I thank my opponent for taking this debate and wait for my opponent's rebuttal.

----Counterargument----  
  
My opponent says ""Gum chewing prevents bad breath.""  
  
Bad breath is extremely easy to fix. Nowadays, most kids brush their teeth before going to school, so there isn't that problem. Also, kids can chew gum BEFORE school or on their way to school to get rid of bad breath. There is no way kids need to chew gum in school to get rid of bad breath. Besides, within 5 minutes of the school day if the kids were allowed to chew gum, the bad breath would already be gone.  
  
""Gum chewing has been proven to help kids focus.""  
  
This is NOT true, though many people wrongly think so. First of all, not enough research has been done to fully prove this is true. Secondly, it does not help you get higher test scores, actually it will distract you from taking the test because you'll be so worried on if it'll help you or not. Knowing the information will get you higher test scores. If gum does anything at all, it is solely based on the placebo effect. Also, when kids chew gum, it distracts the kids next to them that may not be chewing gum.  
  
""People pick up trash after themselves.""  
  
So, some people may be respectful to pick up trash. But let me tell you, in school, kids do not pick up their trash. I have plenty of proof since I am in school. Schools that allow gum chewing have gum in the carpet, under desks and chairs, and all over the walls. It is gross. Kids are getting sick because of all the germs from chewed gum all around them. Janitors don't want to clean up all the gum more then anyone else does, yet they are the ones who have to do it.  
  
""People are respectful and can be told to stop if ""smacking""""

21,"I'm glad you brought up the Voter ID laws actually. When it comes to the idea of changing the electoral college to the number of voters per state, having these laws can be a huge disadvantage. In history many Southern and more conservative states have always felt they needed to have larger representation, one of the reasons for this was because of the large populations in the Northern states. In the beginning of our nation, this has created the three-fifths act where every slave in the south counted for three-fifths of a person. The South knew they had to increase their political status somehow and although they looked at their slaves as barn animals they still tried to count them off as human ( <URL>... ). However in today's political and social atmosphere those opinions are long gone but not the idea of trying to suppress their votes. Were you aware that 31 DMV offices in Alabama will close down? The interesting part about it is that all of these counties are at least 75% black ( <URL>... ). In the article though it talks about how they only account for less then 5% of all Alabama DMV transactions, so in reality it doesn't give a large effect to the state's overall voting capacity. As of 2014 though, 26.7% of all of Alabama is Black ( <URL>... ). So if they try and suppress the voting rights of 26.7% of the voters in Alabama then they will lose 26.7% of their representation in their electoral college if they completely succeed. You see ,mathematically, changing the Electoral College to the number of voters can also punish the more conservative states for their subtle racist policies. For the sake of it though I would prefer to do some more detailed math. Based on a general poll in 2012, the study has shown that 25% of Black Americans do not have an ID. So if we take that into account of the 26.7% of Alabama, 20.025% of Alabama can still vote but also in the same study 8% of whites do not have an ID as well so 60.904% of Alabama can vote as well. Although the ratio of white to black voters go from 3 to 2 down 3 to 1, the percentage of the state's electoral college votes would actually go down by 12% thus hurting it's political representation. The way I figured the percentage was just adding total population percentage loss from both sides and have gotten a 6% cut from the total number of whites in Alabama but have also gotten the same total 6% cut from the total number of blacks in Alabama, thus giving a total of 12% ( <URL>... ). Now my point is this, we can be a lot more efficient and also referee the states that try and cheat through these laws just by counting the number of votes from each state. The math clearly shows just how we can do that and it has shown Alabama can easily lose an eighth of it's Electoral College votes. When it comes to representation though, a lot of these people are on the fringe of the mainstream American society. Do you believe that drug dealers,hookers,murderers and pedophiles deserve a vote? Why is it that when someone commits a felony the first thing we take away from them is the right to vote? It's because we believe their representation is null and void due to the fact they have caused such harm to society. We like to pretend that we would like to listen to everyone's opinion but would you listen to a pedophile's opinion about the sex offender laws being too harsh? And if we listen to their opinions wouldn't we be infringing on the rights of their victims to not live in fear? You see we already choose who gets to vote and who's opinion matters.

What my opponent also fails to realize is that if we were still operating off of tradition, many interracial couples would not be permitted to marry either. --> My opponent is willing to discount an entire group of citizens a human right just because he disagrees with their sexual preference.

I hope that you become more open - minded with age and experience and understand that there are certain things in life that cannot be helped. I did not choose this life, and I'm sure that there are many people who would actually WANT to live this way. I don't believe a lot of people realize that it is not that easy or great to be gay and often times is an internal identity struggle. However, I've learned a lot about people from debating this topic and thank Hunton for the challenge.

I must note however that I need not abide by my opponent's rule on HOW to debunk him. I just shall. In actuality, the most powerful disproof for this is a rather complicated one, one that I am sure he shall not understand. However, I will use these more elementary disproofs for this debate and may post my complicated one either in the forum after this debate, or in my last rounds. Refutation 1: DNA is a genetic code, not a regular code. Regular codes work by way of symbols, something arbitrary and without meaning is GIVEN meaning by an intelligence. DNA genetic code works without symbols. Each nucleic acid is a thing in and of itself and combines to create larger chains. These chains interact with proteins that bind to them and form smaller amino acids that chain into new proteins. There is no meaning and no intelligence involved in the interpretation of DNA. Refutation 2: DNA is not a code, because it does not have arbitrary rules. All codes and languages are governed by arbitrary rules. Grammar and spelling evolve alongside a language. The rules for pig-latin were developed artificially. DNA is governed by the laws of physics, which neither evolve alongside it, or were developed artificially. SEE VIDEO IN CONJUNCTION WITH REFUTATION 3 & 4 Refutation 3: DNA may possibly resemble a code now, but it did not resemble one when it first developed. All codes and languages symbolize something even at the first utterance. DNA originated as amino acids inside a primitive membrane that merely bound to each other and replicated via physical force. Refutation 4: DNA is not a code because all codes could only have been made via intelligence. No known code could have possibly developed naturally. It is possible that DNA arose by way of the video above. Thus, DNA is not a code. Refutation 5: The ""code"" in Pt. 1 is not the ""code"" in Pt. 2- Equivalence fallacy. There are different definitions for the word ""code"". We classify DNA as a code because it shares some similarities to what we view to be codes. The information in DNA is not really information. DNA is not really a code. The notion that codes need to come from an intelligence stems from inductive proof of the actual term ""code"", not things that are similar to it. Refutation 6: All codes can be used by humans in order to express their own meanings. We can use English words, French words, Spanish words, morse code, and even binary in order to express ourselves. However, we cannot use the mechanisms of interpretation of DNA to send messages. Thus, DNA is not a code. Refutation 7: This argument is invalid because it is not scientific. <URL>...

Although I do not proclaim to be a political expert, I trust that it is plain to see where my opponent is incorrect. There is no misrepresentation in the electoral college system at all. In fact, I recall from watching several presidential elections in my time that a large map appears on television, detailing exactly how and where the electoral votes are allocated.  
  
The representation is quite clear and not misleading in the slightest.  
  
  http://en.wikipedia.org...  (United_States)  
  
New York, for example, has 31 electoral votes, and California has 55.  
  
There is no misrepresentation.

I always relish the opportunity to challenge the beliefs and positions held by myself and others. A problem emerges: ""I would like to take this opportunity to remind the reader that this isn't a debate on whether abortion should be legal but rather if all people who think it should be illegal are ignorant and/or inhuman. As such Pro's generic arguments for legalized abortion are off-point."" While I partially agree with Con's reminder to the reader that this isn't a debate on whether abortion should be legal per say, I feel that I must correct my opponent's misconception on the actual subject of this debate. This debate is not about the people who hold a pro-life position but about the position itself being either an inhuman or ignorant position to hold. I do think that a person who holds a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) is ignorant in the sense that they are either ill informed or misguided however I do not think they are inhuman as in suffering from some for of psychopathy. In fact I think they may have an over abundance of humanity however misplaced it may be.

Futhermore, (spelled: Furthermore) emotional attachment doesn't equate to inherent value or worthiness of legal protection. "" I believe I found the issue in rereading my opening arguments and can also see how someone could have taken my position to mean what Con has stated it to be and I'll attempt to address that issue. Addressing the issue: In my opening arguments I stated: ""My basic contention is that a person holding a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) is either inhuman - given the logical, philosophical, and real life consequences of holding and/or implementing said position - OR they are simply ignorant of the consequences of holding and/or implementing their position."" I think this is where the issue/misunderstanding came from and it is somewhat understandable. The language I used can be taken as Con has suggested based on the in limited scope of his response about human irrationality due to our emotional nature and the nature of emotion to override our cognitive faculties. However that maxim does not excuse holding an irrational position but rather it requires that we take emotion and prejudice into account when developing rules and laws which will apply to all people - however rational or irrational they may be - so that the rules and laws are not based on emotions or prejudice. Given the facts and arguments that I presented in my case, (which Con has dismissed off hand as virtually irrelevant given the limited scope in which he has interpreted my position) holding a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) did seem to suggest a desire to cause demonstrable harm to a society (i.e. inhuman intent) unless that individual were simply ignorant of the consequences (logical, philosophical, and real life) of his or her position. There is however a third distinct possibility brought to light by Con's response: The possibility that a pro-life advocate is emotionally attached to the notion of the unborn having rights the same as anyone reading these statements and is therefore holding their position for irrational reasons. Con's case: Con seems to suggest that pro-life advocates are simply mere human and not ""...cold, logical machines that would save the maximum amount of lives regardless of emotions or societal conditioning."" I agree with him, however taken in the context of the subject, this seems to me to be an ""emotional, irrational and prejudice"" response to the ""cold logical"" case for pro-choice I presented in my opening argument. I'm not sure how emotionally cold it is to hold a position that supports a system of laws that promotes the maximum well-being of a society and therefore the highest level of humanity possible. Aside: ""Pro's generic arguments for legalized abortion are off-point. So are Pro's railing against my non-existent theological arguments and defense of abstinence-only education.

The fact that Con would not and will not make religiously motivated arguments on this issue is virtually irrelevant to this debate.

Consider the following list: Cats: Felix - Brown Bob - Orange Margaret - Calico Tom - Gray Rufus - Black Now, what is the ""average"" color?

44,"My opponent's arguments are all logically invalid, as I will show. 1. My opponent claims that something with qualities that are not qualities of life is living. This is obviously false. One of the properties of life is having boundaries. <URL>... (Property Number 3) However, God is defined as omnipresent. Therefore, God is not considered to be a living thing. Therefore, it cannot die, as living things do. 2. My opponent's second claim, that God does not have a physical body (therefore it cannot function) is false, as an omnipotent God would not need a physical body to function. Further, ""listening"" to prayers is not a defined property of God, and judgement was not specified as something God does. 3. My opponent states (again) that God must have a physical body to function. An omniscient and omnipresent God would not exist in a particular location and would not need to be present in a particular location to percieve (as it is omniscient). 4. My opponent's third argument attacks specific religions. However, this is irrelevant to the debate. 5. My opponent's final argument is that God would need a cause. This seems the most justified argument yet, and so I will take some time to answer it. This question creates a trilemma: Either: 1. God existed eternally and the universe did not. 2. There is no God and the universe existed eternally. 3. There is no God and the universe did not exist eternally. When compared to the first possibility, the second is eliminated, as it would be foolish to assume that the physical could exist eternally yet the metaphysical could not.

My opponent's arguments are all logically invalid, as I will show.  
  
1. My opponent claims that something with qualities that are not qualities of life is living. This is obviously false.  
  
One of the properties of life is having boundaries.   http://findarticles.com...   (Property Number 3)  
However, God is defined as omnipresent. Therefore, God is not considered to be a living thing. Therefore, it cannot die, as living things do.  
  
2. My opponent's second claim, that God does not have a physical body (therefore it cannot function) is false, as an omnipotent God would not need a physical body to function. Further, ""listening"" to prayers is not a defined property of God, and judgement was not specified as something God does.  
  
3. My opponent states (again) that God must have a physical body to function. An omniscient and omnipresent God would not exist in a particular location and would not need to be present in a particular location to percieve (as it is omniscient).  
  
4. My opponent's third argument attacks specific religions. However, this is irrelevant to the debate.  
  
5. My opponent's final argument is that God would need a cause. This seems the most justified argument yet, and so I will take some time to answer it.  
This question creates a trilemma:  
Either:  
1. God existed eternally and the universe did not.  
2. There is no God and the universe existed eternally.  
3. There is no God and the universe did not exist eternally.  
  
When compared to the first possibility, the second is eliminated, as it would be foolish to assume that the physical could exist eternally yet the metaphysical could not.  
  
When compared to the first possibility, the third is eliminated as well, for it assumes that the universe exists definitely (so there would need to be a cause for its existence). However, nothing exists outside of the universe to cause the universe to exist. Therefore, the universe should not exist. However, it does, so the third option is eliminated.

I Seriously doubt that fear is the motivation for the FSA stealing from Turkish Merchants. If I were a member of the FSA (who is likely armed) and supposedly fighting for freedom, and I saw a foreigner near me, and my adrenaline was ""pumping through my veins"" the last thing I would do would be to rob that person. Regardless, these are the least atrocious of their violations which include Murder, torture and kidnappings.  
  
Also, the idea of intervening in Syria is wildly unpopular in America, (1) and after all our government exists to act out the will of the people. That's what makes us a democracy.

The word ""is"" indicates that this is about the present time, not 5 or 10 years ago. Though I feel LeBron has been better for the last 5 years, the resolution questions the present time only. C1: Stats The best stats we can use come from last year's basketball season. Lebron averaged more points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks, and had a better field goal percentage and shot the three better (1,2). In the playoffs he had a better field goal percent, as well as more rebounds, assists, and blocks again. The John Hollinger efficiency ratings put LeBron as the most efficient player in the league, 4 spots ahead of Kobe (3). People also love to say how clutch Kobe is. Actually, this is more a product of how many last minute shots he takes rather than how often he makes them. You're bound to make a game-winner every now and then when you're taking them all the time. Kobe only averages 31% shooting in the clutch, over 10% less than his normal average. LeBron has a higher shot % in the same time period (4). C2: Other things Kobe is 33 and LeBron is 26. Most fans can agree that a player's athleticism starts to fade in the thirties. This is evident as he takes more jumpshots now than at any point in his career, rather then driving to the basket which would require elusiveness he simply doesn't have anymore. This is also shown by his field goal % and points per game declining in recent years. C3: Kobe has a bad personality This doesn't actually relate to being a better basketball player, but I feel like bringing this up. Kobe had 16 technical fouls last year (5). A technical foul is attributed to poor conduct on the basketball court, such as excessive arguing with refs, verbally abusing other players, or starting fights. Lebron on the other hand only had 7, despite being the person everybody's looking for to do something bad. Kobe was also fined $100,000 last year for yelling a gay slur at a referree. After receiving another technical foul, Kobe argued with the ref briefly before sitting down on the bench. After slamming his towel on the ground, Kobe yelled ""Hey Bennie!"" (the ref), and when the ref looked his way, Kobe called him a ""F*cking faggot"". (6) Conclusion Even discounting the personal stuff, the numbers show that at the very least, LeBron is a better basketball player at the present time.

"" stop trading relations with a country because of its economy (bad), government (usually communist or anti-democratic), or because of profiling (a huge problem with our government). That reasons are the well-being of the country itself, the people, the economy, and government."" I was simply responding to that point. Valid or not, I had to respond to your argument, that is what debate is all about. You heavily suggested that the reason for the embargo was the communist government, and I had to respond. Now, look at what I said at the beginning of round two. ""2nd The negative suggests that we refuse to trade with Cuba because of their communist government."" I made if very clear that this was none of my own saying, but rather it was what you had suggested in your own argument. There are no holes in my argument, and you have therefore agreed with me on the original point of the embargo. Now that we both agree that the embargo was originally enacted for the same reasons, and we agree that it has now evolved into a punishment for communism. Since we agree, we need not discuss this point for the remainder of the debate. 2nd Are you saying we need to simply give up since there is a possibility Raul will live to an extreme age? As of now, Raul has not appointed anyone to succeed him, and the negative side cannot claim that he will do so in the near future. We have no way of knowing. What we DO know is he could die any day now. We need to get rid of this embargo so American influence can reach Cuba and assist in a transition out of tyranny. 3rd O.k...... I agree with you. Communism is the antithesis of American political goals. I think we are just restating what you said in the first point. This offers no reason to keep the embargo. You don't offer any solvency. I don't see what the point of bringing this up was. Now, since this is my last chance to sum things up, I will go ahead and do so. 1.The embargo had two original goals. One has been abandoned; and the second one succeeded but no longer pertains to the status quo (the Soviet Union). 2.The U.S. could benefit from trade with Cuba. Cuba would IMMENSLY benefit from trade with the U.S., and everyone else would benefit from the repealing of the Helms-Burton act. 3.The embargo is unpopular worldwide. This point has not been refuted by the neg and is an automatic win for the affirmative side. 4.This is the cloudiest point, so I would like to expand on it a little more. There is no guarantee that by ending the embargo will end Cuban communism. However, there IS a guarantee that keeping it is doing nothing. For the 50-some years the embargo has been in place, Cuban communism has not ended. The best option here is to end the embargo, and take down the iron curtain we have over Cuba. Diplomatic success with Cuban citizens is not achieved by ignoring them, but it will by achieved by letting our culture and ideals spill over to their island. Vote for affirmative on the following grounds: 1.Ending the embargo would assist with worldwide economies. 2.It would aid U.S.-World relations (especially with communist countries). 3.It would assist Cuba in transitioning to democracy (or some other communism alternative.)

In this case, fairies are subject to the Devil (who is excluded from this argument). It is common to say, ever since the stories of his fall, that with the devil fell one-third of the host of heaven. From this, I will make the following mini-arguments: 1. The hierarchy of angels is: seraphs, the messegers and pronouncers of god's glory, cherubs, thrones, dominions, archangels, and so on. Judging solely from the characterization of the devil in medieval and Renaissance works as a tricksters, a proud being, and a worker of macchintions and lies, I argue that the fairies, who, according to this belief, retained their purity, are more higher in the angel hierarchy...The virtues and the heavenly governors, and especially the seraphs and so forth, who are close to the glory of God, are supposed less vulnerable to temptations and lies than their servants. Another belief is that fairies were pagan deities (in Celtic tradition) who subsided to the authority of the Lord after their reign. For an instance, let us define what a god, the synonym of deity, is: (dictionary.com) ""one of several deities...presiding over some portion of worldly affairs."" A demon is merely ""an evil spirit"" who works harm but whose powers are limited. (arguments may rest on whether or not the pagan deities, of classical mythology--for example, are more or less powerful than the demon or servant of the devil). The word ""deity"" itself is associated with a sense of ethereal, heavenly power that is far superior to that of the demon or devil... Contention 2: The fairy's weaknesses are few compared to that of the demon. Fairies are vulnerable mainly to iron, which, according to common mythology, is like poison to them. However, they are not fearful of the church's bells, or the cross, holy items, or the presence of the priest as demons are. Contention 3: Good triumphs over evil. The basic stories have been that the forces of light, wise, careful, and powerful, have triumphed from now and then against the forces of darkness. Several examples include: 1. the triumph of Zeus, arguable the force of light--due to his connections with heaven, justice, order, and thunder, against Typhos, the child of Gaea and the storm giant after the Titans 2. the overthrow of Lucifer, the epitome of rebellion and chaos, by the hand of God 3. the classic story of Faust (Goethe) 4. numerous fairy tales in which the trapped prince, by a witch or evil spirit, or princess is freed and the villain defeated and so on.

Nor are the demons who, among others, encourage sorcery and witchcraft, sin (sloth, greed, and so on), violence, and are known for their animalistic bodies exempt from this either.

79,"A big thanks to my opponent for his responses. Let's get right to it. Rebuttal 1: Jellyfish As this (the farming of jellyfish) was a rather unconventional argument, and not one I was familiar with, I began my research from the sites Con sourced. After reading both articles several times, it is revealed that the increasing number of jellyfish has nothing to do with overfishing of jellyfish, but overfishing other species of fish. As predators of the jellyfish decrease in number (due to overfishing), the jellyfish population increases. Further reading proves that it is precisely the sheer number of jellyfish that would cause the issues Con mentions (loss of jobs, danger in the water, decline in fish prices, etc.). As such, using jellyfish protein would seem to have the opposite effect Con proposes, actually benefiting the fishing industry tremendously by removing unwanted and burdensome jellyfish from the areas. Rebuttal 2: Removal of Existing Roads As stated in round one, one of the many conveniences in building solar roadways is that the panels can be built on top of the asphalt roads. The removal of existing roads in unnecessary. Rebuttal 3: NF3 in the Atmosphere While it is true that NF3 warms the atmosphere about 17,000 more times than CO2, it's important to note in what context it is being used. Firstly, the solar panels themselves don't produce the gas; the use of a solar power wouldn't be emitting any nitrogen trifluoride. The NF3 is used during the production of solar panels and there are many options available to reduce emissions. <URL>... In addition, the majority of solar panels don't actually even use NF3. It is only used in a particular kind of panel that is not common. <URL>... Rebuttal 4 and Rebuilding Contentions: Economy As a rebuttal, I'd like to turn our attention to the Golden Gate Bridge. This suspension bridge allows travelers to cross the three mile distance between San Francisco to Marin County. It has been declared one of the 'Wonders of the Modern World'. <URL>... The reason I bring this up is because the construction of this bridge started in 1933 and was completed in 1937. This places the time frame right at the heart of the Great Depression. Even during the time of economic despair, great things were in the process of being made. Just because economic times are hard for us now should not prevent us from paving the way to a brighter future. And while there must obviously be limitations (self-preserving ice cream isn't our priority), the sheer number of benefits solar roadways offer make them a worthwhile pursuit. First of all, running the solar-energy route means that these panels will pay for their cost over time. Secondly, by implementing solar panels as roads, we'd be able to cut back/eliminate costs on asphalt roads, power plants, and power and data delivery systems. There would also be additional costs saved by solar roadways in health insurance. The many possibilities of the solar roadway include illuminating night roads, automatic removal of snow and ice, and pedestrian/ wildlife avoidance systems which will inevitably lead to safer driving conditions, further eliminating costs of production. <URL>... Most importantly, the same tax money that is used to build, repair and resurface roads can instead be put into building solar road panels. <URL>... All in all, the implementation of solar roadways can not only pay for itself overtime, but save countless costs along the way as well, while creating a cleaner environment, less pollution, safer driving conditions, eliminating oil dependency and providing a road that pays for itself. Also, in response to Brusaw stating that the road might fail, the website cited says no such thing. The ecofriend.com website also admits that though it might take several years, the return on investments will eventually cover the costs. For such large returns, it seems to be worth the effort. Rebuttal 5: Durable Solar Panels The solar website cited doesn't say that the panels aren't durable, but that the 'full extent of their durability is unknown'. The solar panels themselves are being tested now and retested in laboratories. They will only be implemented once they are proven to be strong enough to carry the necessary loads. The website mentioned also does not say that creating durable panels will skyrocket prices, nor does it say up keep will more or less eliminate profits. Rebuttal 6: Glare The design for the panel is to be shatterproof and glare proof. <URL> Rebuilding Contention: Environment and Energy Production My opponent mentioned that solar panels only collect 14% of what they receive. Scott Brusaw estimates that they will have 18.5% efficiency and with that assumption, plus an average of only four hours optimum sunlight a day, he calculates that the panels would produce 13,961 billion kilowatt-hours. That figure is after subtracting 31% from the total number due to lack of slant in the solar panels. <URL>...

I may be able to get this stuff done on my iPhone, we'll have to see. It would be preferable to get this debate done by tomorrow. On to the arguments... Sorry for just saying Castro in my proponent speech. I am aware that Fidel has given up his reign to his brother Raul, however they are both technically Castro. Sorry for any confusion that may have caused. 1st Nobody is set to succeed Raul, and Raul is currently 79 years old. You say he is set to rule for 20-30 more years. It is possible, but unlikely. He has already trumped the average life expectancy, and most likely will not live until he is 99 as the negative suggests. Please disregard the negative's argument. 2nd The negative suggests that we refuse to trade with Cuba because of their communist government. How do you explain our trade with China, Venezuela, and even North Korea? Cuba, although communist, is not nearly as communist or hostile as some of the other countries we deal with. I would like to repeat the quote from my proponent speech from Moiss Nam, which said, ""The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere."" 3rd The negative argument does not even begin to be competitive to my third point. My point was that the embargo is both domestically and internationally unpopular, but my opponent just pointed out that Cuba is communist, and that's why there is an embargo. I pointed out the actual reason for the embargo in my first speech. Communism is what the embargo has evolved into, not what started it. Please look to my 2nd point above as to why communism is not a good reason for an embargo on Cuba. 4th Our economy was not necessarily sent into a spiral, but Cuba's was. Also, the negative points out that the economic impact on our country is significant. Why not solve for this? There are obviously no reasons not to. I urge you to vote in affirmation.

Under US law, treason is defined as such: Treason-Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.(1) For this debate, I seek to sufficiently prove that 40th POTUS Ronal Reagan was indeed guilty of treason following the Iran-Contra affair.

The Con may not say ""Because the court found him innocent, he is innocent!"" but rather may say, ""For these reasons the court found him innocent, so he is innocent!"" if he so chooses. The Scandal From '85 to '87 ""The Iran-Contra affair , also referred to as Irangate , Contragate or the Iran-Contra scandal , was a political scandal in the United States that came to light in November 1986. During the Reagan administration, senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, the subject of an arms embargo. Some U.S. officials also hoped that the arms sales would secure the release of several hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. Under the Boland Amendment, further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress. The scandal began as an operation to free the seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by a group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of the U.S. hostages. The plan deteriorated into an arms-for-hostages scheme, in which members of the executive branch sold weapons to Iran in exchange for the release of the American hostages"" (2) Summary -Iran was subject of an arms embargo -Further funding of Nicaraguan contras was banned by Boland Amendment -The Reagan Administration violated the arms embargo by providing iranians with arms, and violated the Boland Amendment by funding the Contras Reagan's Involvement ""I want you to do whatever you have to do to help these people keep body and soul together."" - Ronald Reagan to National Security Advisor on Hostages "" In 1985, while Iran and Iraq were at war, Iran made a secret request to buy weapons from the United States. McFarlane sought Reagan's approval, in spite of the embargo against selling arms to Iran. McFarlane explained that the sale of arms would not only improve U.S. relations with Iran, but might in turn lead to improved relations with Lebanon, increasing U.S. influence in the troubled Middle East.""(3) The actions that spurred the scandal were indeed approved by Reagan, even though he acted mostly with the safety of those hostages in mind. Reagan's approval of this action makes him a co-conspirator to commit treason, as he did knowlingly approve operations that violated an arms embargo, us law, and even his own campaign promises ( to never negotiate with terrorists). "" Reagan, McFarlane and CIA director William Casey supported it. With the backing of the president, the plan progressed. By the time the sales were discovered, more than 1,500 missiles had been shipped to Iran. Three hostages had been released, only to be replaced with three more, in what Secretary of State George Shultz called ""a hostage bazaar.""(3) WIth both the support and approval of Reagan, Iranian terrorists were being prompted to take more and more hostages to acquire thousands of missiles and other weaponry. The Coverup ""When the Lebanese newspaper ""Al-Shiraa"" printed an expose on the clandestine activities in November 1986, Reagan went on television and vehemently denied that any such operation had occurred. He retracted the statement a week later, insisting that the sale of weapons had not been an arms-for-hostages deal.""(3) Not only did he knowingly commit these treasonous acts, he then went on to knowlingly lie about them. First, he denied the operations existance, then he denied the truth of the matter. This is similar to Nixon's involvement with the watergate scandal (except Nixon didn't order the covert actions, only covered them up). Nixon was in the process of impeachment and conviction when he resigned as president and was later pardoned. Reagan is in a very similar situation to this, except he took the extra step further and actually aided in the premeditation and execution of the actions.(4) The Treasonous Actions of Reagan The actions that Reagan took are treasonous because he, The President of the United States, knowingly approved and supported a foreign policy that A) Violated US law B) Violated an arms embargo against an enemy of America C) assissted terrorists that were taking US citizens as hostages. These are all acts that knowlingly gave aid to enemies of the United States, and therefore are acts of treason. Crime and Punishment Just because one who commits a crime is well known and loved does not mean that they are any less guilty of their crime. Just because one commits a crime with good intentions makes them no less guilty of that crime.

I am also sorry that I did not exstend my last round to it's greatest and have a hair on edge, spine tiggerling conclusion. Sorry Skeptic. Anyway alway I go. Fossils are also proof for Noah's flood and more so than evolution. No dinosaur could really climb a tree and when the flood struck the earth the creatures that were mostly mamales could climb trees with much more of a attitude compared to dinosaurs. With nible limbs and claws in such to clumb to higher spots, mamales would seem to have evolved last. Where as the dinosaurs were not agile but were fast runners and also fairly show. Take a look at the Carnotaurus, it has short arms, stronge muscular legs, grew 9m long and 3m tall, not really suitable for climbing at all. To climb anything really, a creature needs to be taller than it is longer. A cat, when standing on its back legs is just that alike with most other mamales such as dogs, bears etc... Birds can simply fly. Now you maybe wondering why some lizards which according to evolution lived around 300 million years ago? The young could climb very well up trees, away from their parents which would eat them, so why did they die in the flood? Well maybe they didn't, the Komodo dragon is very similiar, and its young once hatched climbs and even lives up in the tree tops. And once when they are large enough the lizards will return to solid ground. You did not reply that well back to my bones analogy, in that it make complete sense (some spelling) yet you did not have even a decent come back. Alot of your science is based on possibilities and probabilites, not definite facts or any believable science. And neither am I, however I take creation as a belief where as you take it as scientific. You bluntly commented back to why my philosophy on bones did not work out, I can see it understandably logical, it makes sense that if one bones is a type of creature with in a kind and one fossil is another kind that must result in a different kind from another in real life plays role as another planet. With extraterrestral life of some sort. All alien means is, foreign, from another country or land, planet or universe, whatever. The analogy works, you now need to prove alien life on another planet to suggest all the creatures on earth a related. Therefore making fossils a proven fact that evolution occurs. Unfortunately since this is the last round, you may have to reply in the comment section. I for one do not believe in alien life. In that there is intelligent beings. Since there will be no way to get any signals from unadvased organisms like kittens and puppies, the chance you will prove evolution is very, very slim. The nearest star to our sun is thought to be 5 light years away. I have talked about why carbon and radiomatric methods are untrustworthy (look back to round one, my round) Pro did not reply when I found that scientists who were evolutionists carbon dated dinosaur fossils to find out they were only 1000's of years old. So the scientists scrapped the results. - Still no word from that? I never suggested or thought that the whole feild of science is invalid in the slightest. I will not be obvious and state that I think evolution is not science. Science needs to be tested (micro evolution has) evolution has not been, that being the over millions of years evolution, were it is far too slow to really witness. You base what you find such as fossils and then you plant an imagenation around the facts to support a perfect world to be allow to commit sin in. ""You have failed to give me the links for the inaccurate dating"" - I do not take notice of dating methods, only when dating methods go wrong, then I use that as proof for dating methods to be untrustworthy. Here is a link so that you can see what I am speak of. <URL>... So for example, if a scientist predicts an age for a fossil by how deep it is in the dirt, then returns it back to the lab for anaylsis. Say the fossil was prosumed to be 27 million years old, and the dating method tell the scientist the fossil is actually 9 thousand years old. Who do you trust? The scientist or the dating method? So I ignore them both and turn to the Bible where it says, in Romans 1:25, ""The thruth of God will be exchanged for a lie, where people will start to worship the creatures and not the creator. The Bibel also states to turn away from what man says about the truth. You should flee, as in run and not look back, from lies and sin. Conclusion: Good debate, thank you. Evermore you failed to bring forth proof of any valid reasons but only mere suggestions in why I as a individual should believe and take evolution as science because there are fossils in the ground. Fossils (Like I said eariler) point more towards Noah's flood rather than evolution, that it makes much more sense that the less nible creature drownd first as they could not reach high ground. And small mamales which have been known to live amung dinosaurs simply drownd based purely on their size. Dinosaurs are large and were not good climbers in the least, even Scoody Doo and the Phantom Menis agrees with me. (Parshly a joke) Thank you.",1,GodSands,"

No dinosaur could really climb a tree and when the flood struck the earth the creatures that were mostly mamales could climb trees with much more of a attitude compared to dinosaurs. With nible limbs and claws in such to clumb to higher spots, mamales would seem to have evolved last. Where as the dinosaurs were not agile but were fast runners and also fairly show. Take a look at the Carnotaurus, it has short arms, stronge muscular legs, grew 9m long and 3m tall, not really suitable for climbing at all. To climb anything really, a creature needs to be taller than it is longer. A cat, when standing on its back legs is just that alike with most other mamales such as dogs, bears etc... Birds can simply fly.  
  
Now you maybe wondering why some lizards which according to evolution lived around 300 million years ago? The young could climb very well up trees, away from their parents which would eat them, so why did they die in the flood? Well maybe they didn't, the Komodo dragon is very similiar, and its young once hatched climbs and even lives up in the tree tops. And once when they are large enough the lizards will return to solid ground.  
  
You did not reply that well back to my bones analogy, in that it make complete sense (some spelling) yet you did not have even a decent come back. Alot of your science is based on possibilities and probabilites, not definite facts or any believable science. And neither am I, however I take creation as a belief where as you take it as scientific.  
  
You bluntly commented back to why my philosophy on bones did not work out, I can see it understandably logical, it makes sense that if one bones is a type of creature with in a kind and one fossil is another kind that must result in a different kind from another in real life plays role as another planet. With extraterrestral life of some sort. All alien means is, foreign, from another country or land, planet or universe, whatever. The analogy works, you now need to prove alien life on another planet to suggest all the creatures on earth a related. Therefore making fossils a proven fact that evolution occurs. Unfortunately since this is the last round, you may have to reply in the comment section.  
  
I for one do not believe in alien life. In that there is intelligent beings. Since there will be no way to get any signals from unadvased organisms like kittens and puppies, the chance you will prove evolution is very, very slim. The nearest star to our sun is thought to be 5 light years away.  
  
I have talked about why carbon and radiomatric methods are untrustworthy (look back to round one, my round) Pro did not reply when I found that scientists who were evolutionists carbon dated dinosaur fossils to find out they were only 1000's of years old. So the scientists scrapped the results. - Still no word from that?  
  
I never suggested or thought that the whole feild of science is invalid in the slightest. I will not be obvious and state that I think evolution is not science. Science needs to be tested (micro evolution has) evolution has not been, that being the over millions of years evolution, were it is far too slow to really witness. You base what you find such as fossils and then you plant an imagenation around the facts to support a perfect world to be allow to commit sin in.  
  
""You have failed to give me the links for the inaccurate dating"" - I do not take notice of dating methods, only when dating methods go wrong, then I use that as proof for dating methods to be untrustworthy. Here is a link so that you can see what I am speak of.   http://www.godrules.net...  
  
So for example, if a scientist predicts an age for a fossil by how deep it is in the dirt, then returns it back to the lab for anaylsis. Say the fossil was prosumed to be 27 million years old, and the dating method tell the scientist the fossil is actually 9 thousand years old. Who do you trust? The scientist or the dating method? So I ignore them both and turn to the Bible where it says, in Romans 1:25,  
""The thruth of God will be exchanged for a lie, where people will start to worship the creatures and not the creator.  
The Bibel also states to turn away from what man says about the truth. You should flee, as in run and not look back, from lies and sin.  
  
Conclusion: Good debate, thank you. Evermore you failed to bring forth proof of any valid reasons but only mere suggestions in why I as a individual should believe and take evolution as science because there are fossils in the ground. Fossils (Like I said eariler) point more towards Noah's flood rather than evolution, that it makes much more sense that the less nible creature drownd first as they could not reach high ground. And small mamales which have been known to live amung dinosaurs simply drownd based purely on their size. Dinosaurs are large and were not good climbers in the least, even Scoody Doo and the Phantom Menis agrees with me. (Parshly a joke)

I believe that this issue is an important one to clarify and that it clearly deserves the full treatment that a 3 round debate can grant it. I am for the resolution that morality is an idea. One can scour the entire universe, smash apart all its atoms and model the movement of all the celestial bodies within the bowels of a quantum computer the size of the sun and one will not find one ounce of morality. Morality does not exist any more than beauty or love or wonder exist. They exist within the depths of the human mind alongside angels, demons, and leprechauns. Morality is a human phenomenon, not a physical one. The life-giving sun has no more of a concept of morality than a rockslide. I contend that by default, nothing should be assumed to exist until proof is given. Because of this, I will spend the remainder of my round refuting my opponent's points, since it is up to him to prove that morality does exist as more than an idea. The crux of the first argument of my opponent's argument is the following statement: >When discussing the nature of morality, it's important that it be taken seriously. Every other statement within the first two paragraphs of the body of his argument depends on this statement. The fact that morality must be taken seriously does not grant it existence, making his point irrelevant to this debate. If morality is something other than a mere idea or concept, then morality has existence, whether physical or metaphysical. Mere necessity, however, is insufficient proof of something's existence. Humans need food, and because they need food, food is important that they have it. One would have to be insane, however, to say that the world's starving billions have food simply because it is important that they have it. Yes, it is important that morality be taken seriously, but it does not by any means imply that morality has existence outside of the human mind. >Moral distinction is the act of assessing the moral value of an action. Moral obligation is the act of holding another person or group of people to a specific moral standard. How is your definition of moral obligation anything other than a physical act, one that is exercised in accordance with an idea? >As soon as one person or group obligates another person or group to adhere to their moral distinctions, they are taking an absolute, objective moral position. No, they are merely attempting to pressure another person or group into conforming with their demands. In many ways, this is no different than, for example, exacting a monetary tribute, and indeed, many of our laws are enforced by doing just that. What do you mean by ""subjective"" morality? Do you mean a relativistic morality that is selectively applicable? Ideas can very easily function as ""objective"" moralities, and the ideas do not have to be good ones. A whimsical insistence that everyone must wear purple hats on April 13 of every year ending in 0 is every bit as objective and universal as Kant's categorical imperative if one is to take a lack of relativism to be the definition of objectivity. >The only way to be true to the notion that morality is an idea is to remain wholly within the realm of moral distinction and avoid moral obligation altogether. Are you saying that morality can't be an idea because people force others to act in accordance with it? This would imply that people can't act on ideas. This is preposterous, and I would suggest that you reconsider such statements. >If you truly believe morality to be subjective, then you must also believe by rational necessity that might makes right. If morality is an idea conceived and held subjectively, then it is defined by an individual's thoughts and feelings and not by might. Individual thoughts and feelings are not wholly subordinate to physical might. It is, in fact, very difficult to deliberately mold people's thoughts and feelings solely through the use of might. >This view of morality extends from my worldview and my belief in a transcendent, unchanging God. How do you escape the idea that might makes right if your ""universal"" morality is guaranteed by the mightiest being in the universe? This may, in fact, push you much further into the trap. The preceding paragraphs are more or less irrelevant, however.

What do you mean by ""subjective"" morality? Do you mean a relativistic morality that is selectively applicable? Ideas can very easily function as ""objective"" moralities, and the ideas do not have to be good ones. A whimsical insistence that everyone must wear purple hats on April 13 of every year ending in 0 is every bit as objective and universal as Kant's categorical imperative if one is to take a lack of relativism to be the definition of objectivity.  
  
>The only way to be true to the notion that morality is an idea is to remain wholly within the realm of moral distinction and avoid moral obligation altogether.  
  
Are you saying that morality can't be an idea because people force others to act in accordance with it? This would imply that people can't act on ideas. This is preposterous, and I would suggest that you reconsider such statements.  
  
>If you truly believe morality to be subjective, then you must also believe by rational necessity that might makes right.  
  
If morality is an idea conceived and held subjectively, then it is defined by an individual's thoughts and feelings and not by might. Individual thoughts and feelings are not wholly subordinate to physical might. It is, in fact, very difficult to deliberately mold people's thoughts and feelings solely through the use of might.  
  
>This view of morality extends from my worldview and my belief in a transcendent, unchanging God.  
  
How do you escape the idea that might makes right if your ""universal"" morality is guaranteed by the mightiest being in the universe? This may, in fact, push you much further into the trap.  
  
The preceding paragraphs are more or less irrelevant, however. My opponent succeeded merely in proving that to treat morality lightly is disastrous, not that morality is more than a name for a class of ideas.

1) Keeping aid will prolong human suffering (and taking away aid will reduce suffering)  
2) Pakistan is an enemy, meaning that we wouldn't be hurting an ally.

115,"Thank you for your quick reply. You have yet to show how G-d sinned and refute my argument that G-d, by definition, is all good and thus cannot sin. Let's take a look at the ten commandments--ESPECIALLY the one that says, ""Thou shalt not kill."" The commandment is about respect for human life. God asks us to demonstrate love and not hate towards others by not murdering. We must learn to control our tempers. Taking another person's life is not our right to decide. That judgment is reserved for God alone. That is the thrust of this Commandment. God does not allow us to choose to wilfully or deliberately take another person's life. The Sixth Commandment reminds us that God is the giver of life and He alone has the authority to take it or to grant permission to take it. God wants us to go far beyond avoiding murder. He requires that we not maliciously harm another human being in word or deed. This is why John wrote, "" Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him "" 1 John 3:15 . God desires that we treat even those who choose to hate us respectfully and do all within our power to live in peace and harmony with them. He wants us to be builders, not destroyers of good relationships. To accomplish this we must respect this wonderful gift of this precious possession, human life. You do know that you can break almost any of the Laws of G-d in efforts to save a human life--INCLUDING killing. Not all killing is immoral as even you would probably admit. Source: <URL>... Remember: War=/=Murder. In fact, you were allowed to break almost any of the law of G-d to preserve a life. Why did G-d order to kill? Good question! The fact that it is bothering you indicates a healthy soul...anyway, on to answering the question. Let's take a look at what King Solomon has to say: Everything has an appointed season, and there is a time for every matter under the heaven. A time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot that which is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break and a time to build. A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time of wailing and a time of dancing. A time to cast stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. A time to seek and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to cast away. A time to rend and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace. You see, there are times where war is necessary. The reason G-d ordered the genocide is because he knew that they would be trouble. You know who the number 1 enemies of Israel are today? Iran/Iraq! You know who they were back then? The same people G-d ordered to eradicate. G-d is all-knowing as well as all-loving; therefore, sometimes he does things that make us question.

What happened to my argument about how you can't use self defense to justify the use of guns? ""No where [sic] in the constitution does it say that the federal government cannot restrict the theatre."" I suggest you read this wiki, or even just the first sentence ( <URL>... ). Although the wiki does need citations, the first sentence is pretty straightforward and good. Now click on the word, ""media."" Read through that, and you will find that it is inclusive. I hate to break it to you, but this isn't Soviet Russia. The government CANNOT censor the media. As much as I'd like to see the government do away with Desperate Housewives and American Idol, it is illegal for the government to do that. ""How do they do it? They can't just say ""All citizens report to the nearest police station and turn all firearms"" because the criminals wouldn't do it anyway and the honest citizens would and how would you propose the unarmed mother protects herself and children should they be attacked? "" Your run-on sentence (sorry, had to be said :-)) is absolutely right. You couldn't just have everyone turn it in. That is utter nonsense. You can see how well abolition worked. What you do is you offer a sizable bounty for each gun turned in, you stop selling guns, and you stop making ammo (or rather, don't allow companies to make and sell guns and ammo to regular citizens). Realistically, you can't get everyone to follow the law, but things would significantly lighten up. Just like if we legalized shoplifting, nobody would pay for anything anymore, but since it is illegal, some people still steal, but most people pay. ""Although, then bow and arrow would be the main method of hunting. Most people I know that hunt are not skilled at using a bow, and I'm afraid that the number of hunting accidents could even increase when hunters are limited to the bow and arrow, since most hunters that use rifles are not skilled at bow hunting."" Sorry to have to take away your fun activity, but what you do is go to the supermarket and buy meat that was shot by someone who works at a farm or something. Those guns would be provided by the government, and obviously, there would be severe punishments if they used it for anything else. Or you could learn to use a bow and arrow. ""...moms who carry pistols in their purses to help protect their children from kidnappers and themselves from robbers is not the answer."" Well, it might be different down where you are, but up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, you'd be thought of as a real redneck and a creep if you did that. I recognize it's different in other areas, but to me, it sounds ludicrous. I mean, I'm a pansy, I know, there has never officially been a murder in my town, but still, that doesn't make guns right. ""To help reduce that, I would suggest at least censorship of music, movies, and plays that promote gang violence, murder, and just violence in general. Heck, let's even add video games to that list. THAT stands more of a chance of success in my eyes."" The government cannot censor the media, BUT, if you get rid of guns, the amount of that media will inevitably go down. Wow! Round 3 already!

What happened to my argument about how you can't use self defense to justify the use of guns?  
  
""No where [sic] in the constitution does it say that the federal government cannot restrict the theatre.""  
I suggest you read this wiki, or even just the first sentence (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  ). Although the wiki does need citations, the first sentence is pretty straightforward and good. Now click on the word, ""media."" Read through that, and you will find that it is inclusive. I hate to break it to you, but this isn't Soviet Russia. The government CANNOT censor the media. As much as I'd like to see the government do away with Desperate Housewives and American Idol, it is illegal for the government to do that.  
  
""How do they do it? They can't just say ""All citizens report to the nearest police station and turn all firearms"" because the criminals wouldn't do it anyway and the honest citizens would and how would you propose the unarmed mother protects herself and children should they be attacked? ""  
Your run-on sentence (sorry, had to be said :-)) is absolutely right. You couldn't just have everyone turn it in. That is utter nonsense. You can see how well abolition worked. What you do is you offer a sizable bounty for each gun turned in, you stop selling guns, and you stop making ammo (or rather, don't allow companies to make and sell guns and ammo to regular citizens). Realistically, you can't get everyone to follow the law, but things would significantly lighten up. Just like if we legalized shoplifting, nobody would pay for anything anymore, but since it is illegal, some people still steal, but most people pay.  
  
""Although, then bow and arrow would be the main method of hunting. Most people I know that hunt are not skilled at using a bow, and I'm afraid that the number of hunting accidents could even increase when hunters are limited to the bow and arrow, since most hunters that use rifles are not skilled at bow hunting.""  
Sorry to have to take away your fun activity, but what you do is go to the supermarket and buy meat that was shot by someone who works at a farm or something. Those guns would be provided by the government, and obviously, there would be severe punishments if they used it for anything else. Or you could learn to use a bow and arrow.  
  
""...moms who carry pistols in their purses to help protect their children from kidnappers and themselves from robbers is not the answer.""  
Well, it might be different down where you are, but up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, you'd be thought of as a real redneck and a creep if you did that. I recognize it's different in other areas, but to me, it sounds ludicrous. I mean, I'm a pansy, I know, there has never officially been a murder in my town, but still, that doesn't make guns right.  
  
""To help reduce that, I would suggest at least censorship of music, movies, and plays that promote gang violence, murder, and just violence in general. Heck, let's even add video games to that list. THAT stands more of a chance of success in my eyes.""  
The government cannot censor the media, BUT, if you get rid of guns, the amount of that media will inevitably go down.

128,"<URL>... Above I have posted a link to AIG and the article I spoke of. It is somewhat lengthy, but it is very well informed, also note that it was meant for Christians to read so you will have to read it from that standpoint. As I have left my opponent with very little to discus I will add more topics: Noah's flood. If you look throughout the world almost all cultures have a ""Flood Story"". The strangest thing about this is that some of these cultures have either very little or no similarities besides that. Here is one of the stories taken from Babylon: Once, the gods were angry with men, and they decided to destroy them in a great flood. They warned one good man, Ut-napishtim, to build a boat. The flood came and everything was destroyed except Ut-napishtim's boat, which came to rest on a mountain. He sent birds out, but they could find nowhere to settle. Finally a raven was sent out and it did not return. The earth was beginning to dry out. Ut-napishtim and his family gave thanks for having been saved. This story is almost identical to the Bible's version, aside from the names and specifics if you replace gods with God and Ut-napishtim with Noah it is a shortened out version of the Bible's. The other evidence is that shells have been found as high as Mt. Everest and Mt. St Helen which means that a worldwide flood to even skeptical scientists seems very probable, yet another thing that supports the flood is the Millions of fossils buried in random places, all over the world. Now in order to make a fossil you need a few very specific things: First you need mud, and very quickly you need it to be submerged in an area were the flesh will decay but the bones will be ""mummified"" so to speak. A massive flood is perfect for this so it is a good explanation for the fossils all over the world. Also a big question is ""How did humanity or anything survive?"" well in the bible it clearly states that God told Noah to build an ark and that the ark would have to of each type of animal in it [there were exceptions for various types of animals such as the sheep], but when I ""each type"" I specifically mean ""each type"" as in their would only be one type of dog, one type of cat, one type of big cat, one type of elephant and so on.

They will have likely send an ambassador of some kind, a language expert in hopes of communicating with us, a biologist, and maybe a historian to teach us their past. The possibilities are endless but it is most likely bound to be a peaceful greeting."" This is not consistent with a sleeper vessel. Many of the facts suggested here could be ascertained by the aliens without leaving their homeworld. The ambassodor would be representing a power millions of years extinct.

Under these circimstances the most likely motive is colonisation, attempting to colonise a populated area suggests an acceptance of violence.

My opponent states that,  
""The beings are on a small vessel, coming straight toward earth. Because of the apparent lack of life throughout the cosmos, it would be likely that we would be the aliens' first contact. They would come here to learn about the same things we hope to learn once we actually discover other life. They will be interested the age of life on earth, the age of our sun, and the age of earth, that we are carbon-based life forms, that all life here requires a form of water, and many, many other things. They will have likely send an ambassador of some kind, a language expert in hopes of communicating with us, a biologist, and maybe a historian to teach us their past. The possibilities are endless but it is most likely bound to be a peaceful greeting.""  
  
This is not consistent with a sleeper vessel. Many of the facts suggested here could be ascertained by the aliens without leaving their homeworld. The ambassodor would be representing a power millions of years extinct. A sleeper vessel may have taken many millions of years to reach us, they would not come for simple curiosity.

B) To add, what's most interesting (on the actual page in the link I provide) is that Yamato comments on Sakura's emotions displayed by stating ""It's how strongly you feel for him that counts. Sakura, I can tell just by looking at you that . . . the truth is . . ."" Just before Yamato is able to finish commenting, Naruto is now conscious and Yamato isn't able to say anymore.

Both Naruto and Sakura are teammates and do all things friends typically do together, so there is no doubt that friendship between Naruto and Sakura is common knowledge.

In order to win this debate, you must prove that I actually use or once used crack cocaine. You have the burden of proof because you are the instigator. I just need to disprove your statements.  
  
I would like to present a few definitions:  
Was: past of be  
Is: present of be  
(  http://www.askoxford.com...  )  
It is then clear that the resolution is either true or false. This leads me to believe that my opponent clearly has burden of proof and that no such burden can be shared.

The fact of the matter is, the Constitution was not written by God himself, or even four blessed evangelists. Instead, it was written by mere mortals with their own (sometimes opposing) beliefs and ideas, as well as their own personal agenda that coinsided with the particular going-ons of the time. Perhaps if Thomas Jefferson had a hand in writing this text two hundred years later, his position on certain issues would most likely have been very different! My point: Since 1787, the Constitution has been ratified to include limitations on congressional pay wages and presidential terms, impose the prohibition of alcohol (only to repeal it 14 years later), grant voting rights to women, and abolish the ridiculous 3/5 comprimise which reduced African Americans to the equivocal of 3/5 a person in terms of calculating population for voting purposes. It is not a holy document. It is not a sacred text. It is not the be-all and end-all of literary salvation.

Additionally, for those so interested in small government, i.e. keeping the government out of personal (Hello! ECONOMIC) affairs, it baffles me how they reinforce the government's role in stifling women's rights... for instance, making prositition illegal in 1910 (I won't get into abortion or gay marriage in this debate, since my opponent ever so thoughtfully only mentioned these issues in casual passing), or by infringing upon the right of law abiding citizens to smoke a marijuana cigarette in the privacy of their own homes. The Founding Fathers that you supposedly support would be appalled by these restrictions!

148,"So it seems I've taken the resolution a little off-topic from where the instigator intended for it to go. Very well, I do not think it will hurt my case or my position in this debate -- As Con, I must prove why advocates of universal health care should NOT also be advocating for universal food, shelter or clothing. Got it. Well consider R1 to be a detailed explanation of why advocates of UHC are calling for it in the first place, and they are not ""nuts"" but rather concerned (and sometimes desperate) Americans who are enforcing their constitutional right to call for change. In terms of this debate, Pro has asked that I explain the so-called inconsistency of singling out health care by wanting to make health care universal, whereas other basic human needs like food and clothing are above health care in terms of the hierarchy of necessity, yet people aren't advocating for socialized shelter. First, as I've pointed out, universal food, shelter and clothing are already provided to those in need by the government. Pro notes, ""But none of these programs provide these core necessities to everyone universally."" This is true; one must qualify and meet the living standards deemed appropriate to receive ""free"" food and shelter. However this is because there is not enough funding in the tax budget to distribute to everyone but those who are deemed in dire need. #1 - Americans don't want to raise taxes for universal food, shelter and clothing, because that would essentially turn us into a communist nation. Specifically making health care universal would NOT turn us into a communist nation, as is demonstrated by other countries who implement universal health care and are not communist (i.e. Canada, Britain and France). #2 - One could buy food to live with just a few dollars a day; however, some medical care and costs can be thousands upon thousands of dollars, putting families into debt and/or causing them to seek no treatment at all (which may cost them their health/lives). Prescription drugs, operations or other medical procedures, doctor visits, etc. are all a lot more expensive than these basic needs, especially because there are often no alternatives. ... For instance, if I broke a bone and needed surgery, there is no getting around that. But if I'm hungry and can't afford a gourmet meal or even a fast food meal, there's always the option of buying a bag of Ramen noodles for 25 cents, or in a moment of desparation, even taking left-over food out of the trash (such as some homeless people often resort to). However while one can build a make-shift place to live (even from a cardboard box) and survive, one cannot perform heart surgery on themselves, for instance, thus making health care a greater need. The same example applies to buying a t-shirt at a craft store for $2 as opposed to an Armani shirt for $200. Third, keep in mind that not only the impoverished can benefit from universal health care. The middle class often cannot afford health insurnace while they CAN afford food, shelter and clothing. Thus my opponent has tried to conclude that it is not logical for one to support universal health care and not support universal food; however, he is trying to draw a link where there is none. While I do deem food a greater necessity than health care in general (in terms of life or death), that does not mean that we - as a nation - need universal food more than we need universal health care. So again, offering universal food, clothing and shelter would turn us into a communist nation. We already have programs that offer assistance in these areas to those in dire need. However the establishment of universal health care would NOT turn us into a communist nation. Instead, it would eliminate the high cost charged by insurance companies, and we'd pay less money for (at least) equal or better health care. Everyone would receive this benefit - not just the rich, and not just the poor. Keep in mind that making health care universal could/would probably increase the salary one earns, because offering health insurance would no longer be a perk of a job offer. They'd have to find other incentives to reward their employees with. Hmm. All-in-all, I have pointed out why universal health care is a good idea, while offering universal food, clothing and shelter is not. Universal health care would SAVE people money, whereas the taxation from all of those other goods would cost people money. It also just doesn't make sense in general, whereas universal health care does make sense. So basically, even if you don't agree with universal health care, that's fine... but to say that supporters of UHC should also support other universal programs is presumptious and frankly kind of absurd.",1,Danielle,"

157,"I thank my opponent for this very interesting debate on a controversial scenario. After reading through my opponent's arguments a few times, I found what I thought was the resolution which was: Resolution: Homos [Floresienses] who rape underage girls should not stand trial because they cannot be held liable for their actions, nor are they be capable of defending themselves, in the same way as modern humans are, and therefore, any trial would be unfair. My opponent gives three reasons to support the resolution. Here are my rebuttals: 1) Cannot be held liable for their actions My opponent does not give any reason why Homo Floros cannot be held liable for their actions. Raping a member of any species is wrong and the offender must be held liable by the species which the offender raped. If any species rapes a human, then they must face the human justice system. In the late 1300s, a bull was convicted for killing a five year old boy [1]. A French donkey was accused of savagely attacking a farmer, but was acquited when the farmer testified that the donkey was usually gentle [1]. When a pig killed an infant child by eating its arm and face, it was locked up with human defendents, convicted, and had its own arm and face cut off as a punishment [1]. I assume that it was later turned into a sausage and eaten. If pigs, bulls, and donkeys are held responsible for their actions by humans, so too should the Homo Floro. All animals have their own justice system. Bears don't usually attack humans but when a bear cub is taken, mama bear will bite [4]. Humans must protect themselves the same way. Homo Floros must be treated with respect, but when a Homo Floro rapes a human, humans must put that rapist in jail. 2) Not capable of defending themselves This is not accurate as Homo Floros are perfectly capable of defending themselves. They were advanced people who used fire for cooking [5]. They could certainly use fire in war. They also manufacturing sophisticated stone tools and hunted pygmy elephants [5]. Either way, their ability to defend themselves must not outweigh the fact that they committed an act of violence upon a Homo Sapiens. Homo Sapiens therefore must adequately dispense justice. 3) They might have intercourse with a young girl thinking that she was a sexually mature female Homo Floresiences This is extremely unlikely. Source [2] shows a female Homo Floro while source [3] shows a human girl. Upon opening both sources side by side, it can be seen that the two females look nothing like each other. The only similarity is their size. More specifically, the human girl is clothed and far less hairy than the female Homo Floro. The two also have hair on different parts of their body. While the Homo Floro has hair on her face and upper arms, the human girl only has hair on top of her head. These are few of the many differences. The only similarity is the size. I ask my opponent: Do male monkeys mistake human girls for monkeys and attempt to have sexual intercourse with them despite being the same size? To answer Con's contention, I would like to ask the voters to open sources [2] and [3] and see if it is more likely than not that the voter would mistake one for the other. Sources [1] <URL>...

159,"Thanks for posting such an interesting topic for an argument. I look forward to a good and enjoyable debate and wish all the luck to my opponent. Now to start off I would like to give simple definitions for some of the terms in the Stone Paradox and Resolution: 1. Omnipotent-almighty or infinite in power. According to the Random House Dictionary on Dictionary.com 2. The Christian God-The Christian God is defined as the creator of the universe (as mentioned in Genesis Chapters 1 & 2), who is pure and good (as in the books of Romans, Chapter 3 and Ephesians, Chapter 4) and who happens to also be all-powerful (as found in Matthew Chapter 19 and in the Book of Mark). Now onto my argument, the Paradox of the Stone leads to one of two scenarios: 1. The first scenario is that God cannot create a stone which he cannot lift. This scenario informs us that God is restricted to what he can and cannot do by his own power. Since he cannot create a stone which he cannot lift. 2. The second scenario is that God can create a stone which he cannot lift. This scenario informs us that God can create anything, including items that have power or some attribute that exceeds his own. This would then disprove idea that God is all-powerful, since there is something that can exceed his powerful. Being that the Christian God is defined as all-powerful and omnipotent, he should, in theory, be able to do anything. However, since the Christian God cannot create a stone which he cannot lift or he can create a stone which he cannot lift, it becomes apparent that the Christian God is not the all-powerful being that the Bible and Christian religion make him out to be. This means that either in either scenario there is something that God cannot do. Therefore, by simple reasoning and logic it becomes apparent that there is no way that there is no way for the God that is defined by the Christian Faith to exist.",1,KidateK,"

I have agreed with my opponent on every point he's made up until the third and final round, where he contradicts his previous statements at nearly every syllable. There are a few points I could go into detail about. For instance, he claims that God is the moral standard by which we measure the actions we ""ought"" to do. This contradicts his most precious contention that we have no free will, as actions that we ""ought"" to do implies actions that we ""can"" do. But most importantly, my opponent himself asserts ""If God exists as the being which decides who does and does not go to heaven, then morality is the board of laws through which one would be accepted in heaven."" Therefore, God decides what is moral and what isn't moral, despite our own perceptions. If that's the case, then when God sends a soul to Hell, it IS justified. Let me explain this scenario a bit more articulately. There are only two possibilities: 1. When God sends a soul to Hell, it is moral. 2. When God sends a soul to Hell, it is immoral. If the former is true (which my opponent seems to think is the case), then as I've said, Hell IS justified for whichever souls are sent there. If the latter is true, then God is doing an immoral act by sending them there, and deserves the punishment of Hell Himself. It is logically impossible for those souls to not deserve Hell AND for God to be moral. It is equally logically impossible for those souls to deserve Hell AND for my opponent to win this debate (as it would go against his original proposition). Finally, I will address the only remaining challenge posed by my opponent: the challenge to prove that God sends people to Hell. I cannot prove this, ladies and gentlemen. At least, not with empirical evidence. However, I need only remind you of my opponent's own definition, that God is ""the one Supreme Being, the creator and ruler of the universe."" [1] It should be patently obvious that God, being the ""ruler of the universe"", is responsible for everything that happens within it, including the sending of souls to Hell. Furthermore, even if God DOESN'T send them to Hell directly, He was still the one who gave humans souls (yet no free will), and who created Hell to punish those souls, as explained by my opponent in the first round (the ""no free will"" bit in the second round). In conclusion, I find my opponent's proposition to be false. I thank you, 000ike, for engaging in this interesting debate with me, and the audience for listening to my ramblings.

Furthermore, even if God DOESN'T send them to Hell directly, He was still the one who gave humans souls (yet no free will), and who created Hell to punish those souls, as explained by my opponent in the first round (the ""no free will"" bit in the second round).  
  
In conclusion, I find my opponent's proposition to be false.  
  
I thank you, 000ike, for engaging in this interesting debate with me, and the audience for listening to my ramblings.

191,"Lethality vs. Harmful I already conceded that scorpions are largely not lethal. The crux of my argument comes from the fact that scorpion stings are dangerous, painful and require a hostpital visit if they happen to small children or elderly people. Just as red ants aren't lethal, you wouldn't want your child playing with red ants because their bites are painful. Something can be harmful without being lethal. I have already shown with a reputable source (The Mayo Clinic) that if small children are stung you need to seek medical treatment. While pet scorpions may not be lethal, not only is the possibility of being lethal there, they have a sting that is harmful to three very distinct groups of people pointed out by the Mayo Clinic. Elderly Children Pets Their venom can cause shock in some victims and there is a population of those allergic to scoprion venom much like bee venom. [1] They are not safe pets. All I'm saying, is that the general public might not want to have a scorpion as a pet because of these warnings of potential harm to distinct groups of people which would eliminate the ""general"" clause of the resolution when it comes to scorpions as pets. Ease of Care The point I was trying to make with the ease of care remark was that most common pets (cats, dogs, hamsters, fish etc) are all realatively easy to take care of. Ease of care in a scorpion does not set it above other pets which are also easy to care for. Also, scorpions are not as easy to care for as my opponent makes out. They require strict habitat control with temperatures near 100 degrees at all times (via heat lamp) and a strict humidity level to keep them happy or else you'll have problems. ""[T]he habitat should be maintained at a high humidity level by regular (daily) misting. The substrate should be kept damp, but not wet. If there is mold on the substrate or condensation on the walls of the tank, the humidity is too high."" [1] That seems pretty picky for a pet ""easy to take care of"". You have to mist the cage, keep the humidity to a correct level. That sounds more intensive that dropping a few crickets in now and again. Longevity You compared scorpions to popular pets (cats and dogs) and used longevity as the common denominator. Therefore you were insisting that longevity is what made cats and dogs popular which would make scorpions popular as well. However, I was saying that longevity is not necessarily an important factor for some people and for others longevity is a deal breaker. Each pet owner is different. Some want long living pets, others want short 1-2 year pets. Either way, longevity alienates short life pet fans again making them fit a specific market and not ""general"" pet owners. Most Popular Pets My opponent forgets that I did not make these assumptions about beauty and personality appeal from the top of my head. I derived it from the top ten list of most popular pets in the US and came up with them using common factors between the ten of them. My observations about the appearence is derived from 10 popular sources. All of which have common factors. All of these things were derived from data. The resolution driving this debate is whether or not scorpions are good pets in general. In general meaning they have to appeal to everyone or just about everyone. While some things are indeed subjective, I was trying to find common traits that are accepted by the general majority and in doing so have shown they do not coincide with the likes and wants of the general public. Sure, scorpions can be a good pet for a small group, an individual, a niche but the debate calls for the defense of scorpions as good pets for the general public. As for the other points: - Watching your scorpion eat might be cool once, twice maybe even three times but more than that? Probably not. Things get old eventually. - It's interesting because it's not general. Scorpions are uncommon for a reason. - Like the eating thing, watching them burrow and climb will only be interesting for so long. - A general pet should not require gloves to operate. As for the cuteness of scorpions, you yourself said it's subjective. I pointed out that the things that make a scorpion cute would not go over well in general. Also, they would turn off people who are afraid of insects or spiders. There are those out there (quite a few actually) who are afraid of anything small with more than four legs. This crowd would be completely shut out from the scorpion pet crew. They wouldn't be able to handle one. Because if you really look at it simply, a scorpion is merely a bug. Scorpions are not good pets in general. They exclude too many groups of people such as overprotective mothers, people who find fuzzy pets cute, those who are afraid of insects or spiders, those who want a short term pet. The resolution is negated. [1] <URL>...",1,ConservativePolitico,"
  
  Lethality vs. Harmful  I already conceded that scorpions are largely not lethal.  The crux of my argument comes from the fact that scorpion stings are dangerous, painful and require a hostpital visit if they happen to small children or elderly people. Just as red ants aren't lethal, you wouldn't want your child playing with red ants because their bites are painful.    Something can be harmful without being lethal. I have already shown with a reputable source (The Mayo Clinic) that if small children are stung you need to seek medical treatment. While pet scorpions may not be lethal, not only is the possibility of being lethal there, they have a sting that is harmful to three very distinct groups of people pointed out by the Mayo Clinic.  Elderly  Children  Pets  Their venom can cause shock in some victims and there is a population of those allergic to scoprion venom much like bee venom. [1] They are not safe pets.   All I'm saying, is that the general public might not want to have a scorpion as a pet because of these warnings of potential harm to distinct groups of people which would eliminate the ""general"" clause of the resolution when it comes to scorpions as pets.   Ease of Care  The point I was trying to make with the ease of care remark was that most common pets (cats, dogs, hamsters, fish etc) are all realatively easy to take care of. Ease of care in a scorpion does not set it above other pets which are also easy to care for.  Also, scorpions are not as easy to care for as my opponent makes out. They require strict habitat control with temperatures near 100 degrees at all times (via heat lamp) and a strict humidity level to keep them happy or else you'll have problems.  ""[T]he habitat should be maintained at a high humidity level by regular (daily) misting. The substrate should be kept damp, but not wet. If there is mold on the substrate or condensation on the walls of the tank, the humidity is too high.""   [1]  That seems pretty picky for a pet ""easy to take care of"". You have to mist the cage, keep the humidity to a correct level. That sounds more intensive that dropping a few crickets in now and again.   Longevity  You compared scorpions to popular pets (cats and dogs) and used longevity as the common denominator. Therefore you were insisting that longevity is what made cats and dogs popular which would make scorpions popular as well. However, I was saying that longevity is not necessarily an important factor for some people and for others longevity is a deal breaker.  Each pet owner is different. Some want long living pets, others want short 1-2 year pets. Either way, longevity alienates short life pet fans again making them fit a specific market and not ""general"" pet owners.   Most Popular Pets   My opponent forgets that I did not make these assumptions about beauty and personality appeal from the top of my head. I derived it from the top ten list of most popular pets in the US and came up with them using common factors between the ten of them. My observations about the appearence is derived from 10 popular sources. All of which have common factors. All of these things were derived from data.   The resolution driving this debate is whether or not scorpions are good pets in general. In general meaning they have to appeal to everyone or just about everyone. While some things are indeed subjective, I was trying to find common traits that are accepted by the general majority and in doing so have shown they do not coincide with the likes and wants of the general public. Sure, scorpions can be a good pet for a small group, an individual, a niche but the debate calls for the defense of scorpions as good pets for the general public.   As for the other points:  - Watching your scorpion eat might be cool once, twice maybe even three times but more than that? Probably not. Things get old eventually.  - It's interesting because it's not general. Scorpions are uncommon for a reason.  - Like the eating thing, watching them burrow and climb will only be interesting for so long.  - A general pet should not require gloves to operate.

He didn't want to consume the blood to stop Lucifer but he realized it was necessary (though admittedly inefficient but that was the devil). They did not always fight one at a time, they took down nests of vampires, hives of demons, croatoan packs and many others completely on their own or with at most usually only 2 or 3 more people. If we are not talking about killing what in the world counts as beating? We both know that neither Castiel or the Winchesters would simply give up. They have all risked death, and many times actually died, before the give up so yes, we are talking about killing. Because thats what it would take to beat them. However Crowley, being the coward that he is and has proved to be in multiple situations, would likely give up if it meant preserving his well-being. Following this line of logic Crowley would give in before Castiel ever would and therefore all they would have to do is trap him in a demon's trap (again) and threaten him with burning of his bones, torture by dean, death by Sam, or simple exorcism (which I believe would qualify as beating). Following that line of thought lets think about all the times Crowley has been captured by the boys and Castiel (trapped by bobby, dean, sam by demon's traps multiple times and dragged around like a dog when they had him in the chain). Lucifer said after he was shot that he was one of the five beings that gun couldn't kill. Now I count at the very least five beings stronger and more powerful than Crowley. Lets just take it down to God, Death, Lucifer, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel. Archangels beat demons every time. ""In theory"" being the key words here. How would he release him from the cage again? There is currently no evidence that they could do it again. The rings appeared to be a way to get in, not out. The last seal was lilith, already dead. It may be possible but certainly not simple and I doubt that Crowley would have time to figure it out in a fight, and their is no saying who's side Michael would be on. Now how simple would it be for him to get the colt. The last known whereabouts of the colt was with Lucifer. Lucifer is in the cage. The cage is currently inaccessible. So now in hindsight neither of us should really be using the colt as a pro in either of our argument. Castiel is very good at finding things.

It could most definitely destroy the vessel of a lowly demon which, and I am still confused on this, I would believe would fall under the category of ""beating"" him.

Death has helped them multiple times at first simply for his own gain but when he brought Sam's soul back he did something that has little or no gain for him. Even if he isn't an ally its already been proven that he can be fairly easily bound and if they did this they could obtain another very important weapon and that is Death's scythe.

197,"Ave. Sadly, Pro has broken the rules of the debate that I stipulated in the first round. I stated that the first round of the debate was for acceptance, and arguments would take place in round two. Every argument Pro gave in the last round is impermissible. I ask Pro to give her arguments during the appropriate round. I would like to state, in clear terms, what I will be arguing for in this debate. I believe that cosmology demonstrates that there was no initial state of the universe, or a singularity. God is defined as the cause of the initial state. If there was in fact no initial state or singularity, then god cannot exist, because an attribute of god cannot be actualized. This will be called the 'No Initial State' argument, and the premises go like this. 1: Cosmology demonstrates that there is no cosmological singularity. 2: An attribute of god is that god caused the cosmological singularity. 3: From one and two, god has an attribute that is impossible. 4: God does not exist. [Support for P1] The theory of relativity is one of the most proven theories in all of science. There are many proofs of general relativity, some complex and some simple, so I will show that relativity is true using one of the simpler arguments. For many centuries, it was noted that the orbit of Mercury was slightly different from what Newton's equations would predict. Instead of orbiting in a perfect ellipse like other plants, the orbit of Mercury precesses (which means it does not return to the same point after one orbit, but shifts slightly). When Einstein calculated the orbit of Mercury using the equations of general relativity, it predicted the orbit of Mercury with perfect accuracy. This is a strong indication that the theory of relativity is true. So, what implications does the theory of relativity have on the first premise? Well, there are equations derived from the theory of relativity called the 'Freedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker' metric. This metric describes a universe that is homogeneous, isotrophic, and expanding universe. The models of the universe that are based on this metric have no initial state. [2] There is not some state X that god can cause. Because general relativity is true, FLRW metrics are true, and therefore there is no initial state. The Hawking-Penrose singularity theorem posits a singularity that the universe came from. However, Hawking and Penrose have withdrawn this theorem a long time ago. Why? They realized that, once you take quantum mechanics into account, there is no need for a singularity. Hawking has this to say in his book A Brief History of Time. [2] "" It is perhaps ironic that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other physicists that there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe--as we shall see later, it can disappear once quantum effects are taken into account ."" [3] Quetin Smith, professor of the philosophy of physics at Western Michigan university, talks about the impossibility of a singularity. "" The cosmic singularity is a hypothetical time t=0 at which all the laws of nature, space and time break down. It is hypothetical or merely imaginary because if it did exist, it would be a physically impossible state, due to the breakdown of all laws, even the laws required for time to exist. This breakdown at the hypothetical t=0 implies there is no first instant t=0 of the finitely old time-series and that each instant is preceded by earlier instants. "" [4] Cosmology supports the idea that there was no initial state or a singularity. [Support for P2] The truth of P2 is contained in the definition of god that Pro agreed to in round one. [Support for P3] This follows logically from P1 and P2. [Conclusion] If there is no initial state, then god cannot cause an initial state. An attribute of god is causing the initial state. Since it is impossible for god to cause an initial state, an attribute of god cannot be actualized. Therefore, god does not exist.

[2] There is not some state X that god can cause. Because general relativity is true, FLRW metrics are true, and therefore there is no initial state.  The Hawking-Penrose singularity theorem posits a singularity that the universe came from. However, Hawking and Penrose have withdrawn this theorem a long time ago. Why? They realized that, once you take quantum mechanics into account, there is no need for a singularity. Hawking has this to say in his book A Brief History of Time. [2]  “  It is perhaps ironic that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other physicists that there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe--as we shall see later, it can disappear once quantum effects are taken into account  .” [3]  Quetin Smith, professor of the philosophy of physics at Western Michigan university, talks about the impossibility of a singularity.  ""  The cosmic singularity is a hypothetical time t=0 at which all the laws of nature, space and time break down. It is hypothetical or merely imaginary because if it did exist, it would be a physically impossible state, due to the breakdown of all laws, even the laws required for time to exist. This breakdown at the hypothetical t=0 implies there is no first instant t=0 of the finitely old time-series and that each instant is preceded by earlier instants.  "" [4]  Cosmology supports the idea that there was no initial state or a singularity.  [Support for P2]  The truth of P2 is contained in the definition of god that Pro agreed to in round one.  [Support for P3]  This follows logically from P1 and P2.  [Conclusion]  If there is no initial state, then god cannot cause an initial state. An attribute of god is causing the initial state. Since it is impossible for god to cause an initial state, an attribute of god cannot be actualized. Therefore, god does not exist.

212,"I thank Yassine for accepting this debate. I am not sure what to expect from it, but we shall see. C1. Benefits & Impact Marriage, as defined in the resolution, entails a range of benefits for the couple, including constitutional benefits such as tax protection, tax rebates, inheritance rights (pension & estate), medical rights, spousal privilage and transferrable recognition of relationship. This also constitutes benefits regarding immigration, and housing, to name just a few. A case study would be in the US, there over 1,100 benefits, rights and protections are provided on the basis of marital status in Federal law.[1] Further, marriage is known to convey a plethora of health benefits for said couples.[2] Studies have conclusively linked marital status with decreased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer and surgery. Improved mental well health and longer lives.[3] Thus, to permit incestuous marriage would be to grant the same privileges that any other married couple currently enjoys across the globe. The impacts of such are relatively unknown due to the strong legal and social stigma against incestuous relationships. However, the fact that consensual incestuous relationships can and do occur is well-established. Famous case studies include relationships between siblings removed at birth/young age only to later meet (cf. accidental incest).[4-6] C2. No harm principle John Mill once argued ""The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."" , this applies within this context of liberty in this case. Since (consensual) incestuous marriage is only going to be as harmful (i.e. not very/at all) as any other marriage - thus if we value the institute of marriage for the run-of-the-mill couple, then we have no legitimate reason to prevent incestuous couples from doing the same, and preventing such impinges upon the liberty of the parties being oppressed.[7] Incest for those nations that prohibit is it regarded as a ""victimless crime"",[8]and hence according to the no harm principle ought not to be prohibited. To prohibit such a marriage would be to prohibit based on immutable characteristics, however people cannot be accountable for their immutable characteristics, only for their choices. If closely related individuals have a romantic attraction to each other, the fact they are closely related is not something that is ""correctable"" by either individual, it is inherently unfair. This would be equivalent to prohibiting selling something to someone based on their race or ethnicity, or employment based on their sexuality - clearly none of these have anything to do with one's values or rights as a person. C3. Arbitrarily nature of prohibiting incestuous marriage & relationships The term ""incest"" is a loosely defined word, as it's contingent on society's perception of ""closely related"", however all humans are related on some level, thus incest on some level is occurring within every single relationship on some level, since we are at most 16 generations removed from any other person in 99.98% of cases.[9] Moreover, the practical implementation of laws regarding incest attest to the arbitrary nature with those that do prohibit incest do so with varying ""closeness of relation"", for example the UK prohibits anything closer than first-cousinship (the 12.5% rule), whereas Brazil prohibits only on the third degree (25%) and some states of the US prohibits anything closer than and including first cousinship (6.25%). [ <URL>... ] Such widespread disagreement follows from non-intrinsic ""wrongness"" with degree of closeness of relation. If we permit second cousinship for example, then we need a good reason to justify why we permit that and not first cousinship. If we permit first-cousinship, then we need a good reason why we permit that (12.5%) and not those of half-siblings (25%), and so on and so forth. The lack of an intrinsic reason regarding closeness of relationship entails there isn't an inherent reason to prohibit incestial relationships, and by extension, marriage. C4. Discrimination Given the above, prohibiting incestuous marriage is discriminatory in the same manner as prohibiting same-sex marriage, or prohibiting inter-racial marriage. If we value a society in which the majority does not oppress the minority on its own whims, then we also value a society where the option for marriage with ""close relations"" is available, as we do those of the same gender or different race.

219,"I accept your challenge and look forward to this debate. Where as we established no rules as what the rounds shall be for, I will only offer my case on the first round and save rebuttals for later. I would like to start by saying, I am not entirely in favor of Obama in fact in most ways I disagree with him. I will however play devils advocate in this debate and promote his policies, the ideology behind it(as worded in title), and how they have helped or ideologically could help our society. I will now establish my points. I would use more but I would run out of space so I will focus on 4 main points. I will ignore how these could actually effect us and merely show the ideology behind it, since per the title I am allowed. Let us define ideology. Also let me define the word Ideology Definition of Ideolgy 1: visionary theorizing (1) Redistribution, (2) Obamacare and healthcare(slang word for reform), (3) Energy policy, (4) Immigration policy (1) Redistribution of wealth at its core, is the framework of socialism. While I openly acknowledge that this can not work in America, the ideals and hopes behind it are something that we can admire. Just from the title of this point we can see what it entails. It adopts this Robin-hood ideal of take from the rich and give to the more, but it does it in more of a modern day sense. This is accomplished by raising taxes on the rich, and lessening taxes on the poor. While this not may be practical or work in America, I think the ideology behind this is irrefutable. If we are looking at this from a perspective of hope and how it could work, it seems like the moral act to do. It helps the poor and is a way to get rid of poverty. As long as we ignore the practicality of it, it makes logical sense and appeals to our sense of morality. This could even stretch as far as raising minimum wage. People who work for hardly nothing and may not have the money to attend school have a shot at making a little more money. <URL>... (2) This is Universal healthcare and reform. Again I am going to ignore how this will affect us as a nation and argue ideology. Just a few thoughts on why this a moral ideology behind it. The main point is that it helps support and give care to people whom may not have been able to attain it previously. Companies can no longer turn down people with preexisting medical conditions. This goes as far as any type of terminal illness such as Leukemia. Prior to this companies could simply refuse coverage because it could be a possible loss of profit, and individuals were actually dying because they could not get coverage. It also allows kids to stay on their parents insurance longer. <URL>... <URL>... (3) His energy policy speaks for itself. Partially the reason the key stone pipeline has not been approved. It is a way to cut down on global warming, and provide clean energy. The basis behind this is that at some point either when prices in oil get to far out of hand, or we drain our resources and topple most of the oil, we need a viable alternative source on energy. He went with clean energy. This could extend to solar energy and electrical forms of gars that do not produce fumes. Since we all know or at least most know that global warming is a fact and major issue, this would help keep the planet safe. <URL>... <URL>... (4) I could debate this from a practical or ideological but I will stay with ideology since that has been the foundation of my points. This entire policy makes it easier for immigrants to attain citizenship legally, and makes the process smoother. One of the central reasons behind this line of thought, is that we can not stop illegal immigration. They are using our government and attaining an education, and then taking that education back to their home country because they can not get citizenship. It states we should make citizenship easier for them to attain, so that they can help stimulate our economy instead of abusing the system and leaving. There is way more to it than this but since I am running out of room, I will just tackle pros rebuttals. This also helps children who were born over here because of illegal parents keep their citizenship. This is just morally ethical, unless you love the bible so much that you believe the sins of the father be passed to his children. We have children being born in this country by illegal parents, and could not call them citizen. The very children that have only knew this country as their home. They were born here, raised here, worked here, and went to school here. This is all they know and this is their country. This to me is moral ideology at its core. <URL>... I have established 4 main points and shown how Obama policies are ideologically sound and look forward to hearing my adversaries response.",1,Mikal,"

Also let me define the word Ideology  Definition of Ideolgy  1: visionary theorizing  (1) Redistribution,   (2) Obamacare and healthcare(slang word for reform),   (3) Energy policy,  (4) Immigration policy  (1)     Redistribution of wealth at its core, is the framework of socialism. While I openly acknowledge that this can not work in America, the ideals and hopes behind it are something that we can admire. Just from the title of this point we can see what it entails. It adopts this Robin-hood ideal of take from the rich and give to the more, but it does it in more of a modern day sense. This is accomplished by raising taxes on the rich, and lessening taxes on the poor. While this not may be practical or work in America, I think the ideology behind this is irrefutable. If we are looking at this from a perspective of hope and how it could work, it seems like the moral act to do. It helps the poor and is a way to get rid of poverty. As long as we ignore the practicality of it, it makes logical sense and appeals to our sense of morality. This could even stretch as far as raising minimum wage. People who work for hardly nothing and may not have the money to attend school have a shot at making a little more money.   http://www.quick-facts.co.uk...  (2)  This is Universal healthcare and reform. Again I am going to ignore how this will affect us as a nation and argue ideology. Just a few thoughts on why this a moral ideology behind it. The main point is that it helps support and give care to people whom may not have been able to attain it previously. Companies can no longer turn down people with preexisting medical conditions. This goes as far as any type of terminal illness such as Leukemia. Prior to this companies could simply refuse coverage because it could be a possible loss of profit, and individuals were actually dying because they could not get coverage. It also allows kids to stay on their parents insurance longer.   https://www.healthcare.gov...  https://www.healthcare.gov...  (3)  His energy policy speaks for itself. Partially the reason the key stone pipeline has not been approved. It is a way to cut down on global warming, and provide clean energy. The basis behind this is that at some point either when prices in oil get to far out of hand, or we drain our resources and topple most of the oil, we need a viable alternative source on energy. He went with clean energy. This could extend to solar energy and electrical forms of gars that do not produce fumes. Since we all know or at least most know that global warming is a fact and major issue, this would help keep the planet safe.   http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org...  http://www.whitehouse.gov...  (4)  I could debate this from a practical or ideological but I will stay with ideology since that has been the foundation of my points. This entire policy makes it easier for immigrants to attain citizenship legally, and makes the process smoother. One of the central reasons behind this line of thought, is that we can not stop illegal immigration. They are using our government and attaining an education, and then taking that education back to their home country because they can not get citizenship. It states we should make citizenship easier for them to attain, so that they can help stimulate our economy instead of abusing the system and leaving. There is way more to it than this but since I am running out of room, I will just tackle pros rebuttals. This also helps children who were born over here because of illegal parents keep their citizenship. This is just morally ethical, unless you love the bible so much that you believe the sins of the father be passed to his children. We have children being born in this country by illegal parents, and could not call them citizen. The very children that have only knew this country as their home. They were born here, raised here, worked here, and went to school here. This is all they know and this is their country. This to me is moral ideology at its core.   http://www.immigrationpolicy.org...  I have established 4 main points and shown how Obama policies are ideologically sound and look forward to hearing my adversaries response.",Politics,0,Obamas-policies-and-ideals/1/,27095
220,"In conclusion, IVF treatment may have beneficial progress toward our understanding of the human genome and may even influence our medical technology for the greater good, however this does not outweigh the current drawbacks to costs, side effects, errors, and whether or not it could be a successful treatment. Even if there was a placement of multiple embryos, there is still a very good chance the pregnancy could result in multiple pregnancies, given that 20-30 percent are multiple pregnancies. By using IVF there may be side effects which occur. These could vary but typically ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome. Because ovaries are stimulated to produce more than one egg, the hormones and drugs used can lead to this syndrome due to an imbalance of normal FSH. Moreover, even after for paying for blood tests, screening, and materials, it can add up, even with the IVF treatment procedures and multiple cycles if the procedure fails. The process could be highly stressful on the patients who decide to partake in the treatment. Most of the time, it can be hard to see a loved one go through the cycles and screening that may occur as numerous results could lead to implications, no progress, and expenses that must be paid even if the couple or person""s treatment was not successful. High estrogen levels associated with high stimulation of IVF shows signs of increasing the chance for a baby to have a premature birth accompanied by low birth weight. There is a connection between this and long term health problems for the child in the future. The high estrogen levels has been shown to affect the intrauterine environment. The selection of embryos may prove it is unethical as parents are virtually selecting their child""s genes and preventing any genetic diseases that may take place. This essentially creates a perfect baby in which can seem immoral as a birth should be natural rather than selecting genes. The success of IVF is not guaranteed and typically people have to undergo more than one cycle of treatment before they are successful. As of right now, just over 25% of IVF treatments result in a live birth. With this we would also be progressing toward a society which is only seeking a child's genotype rather than their unique characteristics which they behold by the natural reproduction process.

Similarly, we can look at DNA and say that it is a code, and it fits the definition of a code, but it is not a code, since it is merely our description of a natural occurrence.

Hitler""s mistake came when he launched operation Barbarossa aka the invasion of the Soviet Union. Hitler greatly under-estimated the Soviets power of rebellion and the Russian winter which centuries before is what also halted Napoleon""s invasion of Russia which lead to his defeat (and that""s why we learn history to not repeat the mistakes of past). The reason Hitler planed the invasion was due to the failed invasion of Brittan and the need for oil. During that time the USSR was in control of the coccus oil fields a huge source of oil and that""s something Germany needed greatly to keep the war machine going. Instead of doing the logical of doing business with the Soviets Hitler decided on an invasion. If Hitler was any the more wiser Hitler would have continued the shelling of Brittan but diverted the bulk of his forces to Africa to help Rommel and once in control of Africa then Hitler could have moved his forces to the middle east and taken over that area and exploit it for its oil and not have to go to war with the Soviets. The irony here was Hitler originally made the agreement with Stalin because he knew that fighting two fronts was asinine and had looked at the lessons learned from WWI but soon forgot them once he invaded the USSR. The easy thing Hitler could have done was take the Middle East leave the Soviets alone and worry about taking over Brittan. Once Brittan had fallen and was under Nazi control then all Hitler had to do was build up his military bigger and all his resources and wait for the Japanese to finish up with the pacific, which brings me to my next point Pearl Harbor. As we all should know December 7, 1941 the Japanese imperial Navy led a surprise attack on Perl Harbor in an effort to cripple/ destroy the American navel fleet which was stationed there. Admiral Yamamoto lead this attack too soon, I say this due to Japan leading a ground offensive against the Chinese. What Tajo and Yamamoto should have realized and done was finish up the capture and take over of china and then use the resources of China to build more warships, tanks and equipment. Once sufficient resources were built up Japan should have lead an invasion of Sidney, Australia while also then launching an attack on Pearl Harbor and the US bases on the Philippines and get the oil with Australia falling to the Japanese Americas navy defeated then Germany would launch an invasion on the east coast while Japan did the same on the west coast. Yes it would have been a long drawn out fight but the US military in total only numbered 300,000 and with no support from any allied nation as they all fell America would fall within a few months as we would have to build up our industry our military all of which couldn""t happen so easily as the US would be sandwiched on each coast and American industry would be bombed just like what the US and Brittan did during our offence during WWII how we bombed German industry they would do the same to us and it would only be a matter of time till we fell and next would be Russia same technique and soon Germany would own the western world and Japan would own the eastern world.

Resolution: Language barriers have a net positive effect on the video game industry  
  
==DEFINITIONS:==  
  
Video Game Industry: The industry that specialises in the development and promotion of video games.  
  
Video Games: An electronic or computerized game played by manipulating images on a video display or television screen. [  http://dictionary.reference.com...  ...]  
  
Language Barrier: barrier to communication resulting from speaking different languages. [  http://dictionary.reference.com...  ...]  
  
==CON ARGUMENTS:==  
  
===1) The cost of translating games===  
  
Translating a game from Japanese to English, French, Italian, Spanish is quite a costly process. First and foremost, translators need to be hired to translate the text. After that, you need voice actors, which do not come cheap. Most games easily have thousands of words of text. The cost of translating is outlined here :   http://www.clarktranslations.com...  .... The cheapest goes at $.14 per word. $.14 x 5000 = $700. This must be done for several languages, and 500 words would be considered a low amount of text.

Introduction  
==================  
  
I extend my highest approbation to abard for his kindness in this debate. He makes a great case with his ""filling in the blanks"" hypothesis. However, and unfortunately, his case is sorely wanting in the area most fundamental for the fulfillment of his burden – I will expound on this below.  
  
==================  
As science explains, people believe less?  
==================  
  
My opponent's entire premise erodes beneath him because its very foundation is unsound! He says that, due to science, people are now less likely to believe in god(s). This could never more untrue! Atheism is in decline worldwide (1). Munich theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg has said, ""Atheism as a theoretical position is in decline worldwide."" Alister McGrath, an Oxford Historian, in his book, ""The Twilight of Atheism,"" meticulously explicates this phenomenon – pointing out that if atheism is the nexus of reason and science, why has it become so rare by the turn of the 21st century? In a recent article, McGrath comments on atheism's future saying it, ""seems increasingly to lie in the private beliefs of individuals rather than in the great public domain it once regarded as its habitat.""  
Belief in God is actually increasingly globally – steady and persistent.  
  
==================  
Point of a Personal God  
==================  
  
This is the crucial and fundamental point that my opponent misunderstood (I'm sorry if it was not entirely clear). There is no reason for people to make up a personal god – one who is deeply interactive and participatory. My opponent's argument would rightly apply to a deistic understanding, but certainly not a theistic one. The god of deism serves only to fill in the so-called scientific blanks. But the god(s) of theism could not have sprung from a similar desire to fill in the blanks, as its interactive and participatory initiative with mankind fills no blanks – there was never any need to posit a PERSONAL god(s) in the first place!  
  
==================  
Moral Propositions and Logical Absolutes  
==================  
  
My point was not that someone cannot be moral or logical absent god, but the very fact that all cultures, near and far, adhere to the principles of logic and all make moral proposition is societal evidence that favors the existence of God.  
  
==================  
Does the article support this claim?  
==================  
  
My opponent suggests that the article listed in round 1 actually supports his claim. This is thoroughly untrue. First, you need not know all the complex mechanisms of evolution in order to believe that it is true – most all of its adherents have only a superficial understanding. But what the article shows is that, from birth, human-beings are predisposed to believe in god. This means that it is not something that springs from society, but something that is innate.  
  
==================  
Grand Assumption  
==================  
  
When I stated that my opponent's grand assumption was that he actually thinks the human tendency to believe in God is evidence that God does NOT exist!, he responded saying, ""Yes and no. I'm saying that that is a major part, and the more science that is readily available to society, the fewer people believe in God.""  
  
As already pointed it, this analysis is completely wrong. As Phil Zuckerman points out in a recent presentation on his findings from surveying non-belief – atheism is on a worldwide decline (2).  
  
==================  
Conclusion  
==================  
My opponent's thesis relies on a flawed assumption and therefore falls short of fulfilling his burden. Atheism is not on the increase, but on a worldwide decrease. Moreover, if we are innately predisposed to believe in God, then there is no reason to believe that God sprung from a societal pattern, but an innate one.

238,"First off, thank you for starting what is sure to be a very interesting and intellectual debate. Although I do have reservations about this, for the purposes of this debate, I will debate as if I do not have those reservations. So, I think we can agree that there are two main types of firearm: Assault weapons and hunting weapons. I'm sure there are more descriptive terms (and I could be completely wrong; correct me ifthat is the case), but I'm not well versed in Gun. I've never shot one in my 35 years of existence, and I don't plan to in my remaining 300 (or so). So, I definitely cannot see why someone would need an assault weapon. If I am correct in my idea of an assault weapon, it is one specifically made to kill other people. Yes, those can be used for self defense, but even from a pro-gun stance, you can just as easy pick up your hunting rifle (obviously that wouldn't work from my stance, but I'm just establishing the question of why anyone would need an assault weapon). Oddly enough, it seems most murders are committed with assault weapons.you have to attack the root of the problem. Those are the assault weapons. Now, it is hard to justify my stance on hunting weapons, but I still have tricks up my sleeve. Obviously people enjoy hunting, and it would be hard to take that right away, but it goes wrong just a little too often. Imagine this scenario: A hunter (let's call him Jed) is hunting with his son (let's call him Buck). Buck has gone hunting a few times, and Jed is a lifetime hunter. So, Buck hits a really big, well, buck and so he needs help getting it up. Jed goes over to help. So, Buck is inexperienced, so he is fumbling around the gun to find the safety. He finds it eventually, but in the process, he accidentally pulls the trigger. The bullet missed Jed's face by a mere 2 inches (sorry, I don't like hurting or killing people). It's simply too risky to allow dangerous things like that. Didn't like that one? Here's another: A very important man (let's call him Dick) and his good friend (let's call him Harry) go out quail hunting. Dick sees something move. He assumes it's a quail. He shoots at it. 3 years later, Harry Whittington still has 150-200 birdshot pellets inside of him, somewhat of a trophy saying, ""I've been shot by Dick Cheney!"" I don't like taking away peoples' rights, but it is simply too dangerous to keep hunting. Sorry. I'm looking forward to a great debate, and I am eagerly awaiting your response.",1,abard124,"

239,"I thank Feverish for accepting this debate. I would first like to point out that the Princeton dictionary lists 4 different definitions for Nationalism and to fit under a definition, one must only meet a single definition, not all of them. So the one that he listed is not the only definition for Nationalism that would need to be met. The 4 deffinitions are [1]... *patriotism: love of country and willingness to sacrifice for it; ""they rode the same wave of popular patriotism""; ""British nationalism was in the air and patriotic sentiments ran high"" *the doctrine that your national culture and interests are superior to any other *the aspiration for national independence felt by people under foreign domination *the doctrine that nations should act independently (rather than collectively) to attain their goals And we also find other definitions elsewhere. And we can see a simple trend in the definitions. It is a philosophy centered around a desire of national identification (meaning having an independent state) focused on either region, culture, or the current government. Since we are talking about ""White Nationalism"" this should obviously focus down to culture, since there is no ""White"" region in the world. And since ""white nationalism"" is often viewed against ""multiculturalism,"" that only more strongly affirms that WN is focused around cultures. I would disagree that White Nationalism is exculsively focused around the belief that a white culture is superior to every other culture. We can see from the many definitions, that ""superiority"" only really pops un in one of the many definitions. I would like to open arguments by looking at various types of Nationalism in history, to show that ""superiority"" over others in not inherent to that word. Particularly, Irish nationalism and the American Revolution. Irish Nationalism [2] - ""political and social movements and sentiment inspired by a love for Irish culture, language and history, and a sense of pride in Ireland and the Irish people. Today, the term generally refers to support for a united Ireland."" Please note, that none of this involves a sence of superiority or a claim of ""we're better than you."" In fact, most Irish Nationalist, while many do hold some resentment against Britian (namely because they view Britian as the obsticle in preventing them from having their own nation), they really don't hold anything any view against American culture, or Chinese culture, or really any other culture. If we go to the American revolution, that was also a large nationalist movement to gain independence from England and to establish their own nation so that they could have their own rights. They did not view that they were superior to everyone else (I'm sure some individuals did, but the movement as a whole did not) [3]. If we expand that understanding of ""nationalism"" to ""white nationalism,"" we see that white nationalism is really nothing more than the advocacy of a national identity of the white culture (remember, that nationalism is tied to either culture or region). We then come to having to ask, what is ""white culture"" and does it even exist? It may sound strange, since, in America, we are very much ""multi-cultured,"" though we can get an idea that white culture does exist by looking at other cultures that we clearly know exist. We can clearly see that there is a hispanic culture, and that there is an african culture, and that there is an asian culture, and that there is a native american culture, so it should be only all too natural that there would be a white culture too. And within each of those larger cultures, there are many subcultures. For example, Chinese culture and Japanese culture, both fall under ""asian culture"" but are still different. And so we would also expect different subcultures within white culture. Third, I'd like to point out that wanting a place of your own (in this case, for your own culture) does not mean that you view others (in this case, other cultures) as infearior. If I want a house just for myself, that does not mean that I want my neighbor to not have a house, or that I think I'm better than him. It simply means that I would like a place of my own, and I can have no problem with him having a place of his own, or, if he would like, he is free to live in a community dwelling (i.e. multiculturalism). We can see this mentality a lot on state levels. Many states have different views on medical marrijuana, or minimum wage, or what have you. And so many of them choose what they want for themselves and they don't go trying to force other states to change. We see this a lot on the national level. We have our ""house"" (our nation) and we do with it as we please, and we don't try to force every other nation to do what we think is best (minus the occational dictator or two). This shows that we can have a single view for improving ourselves, without trying to force those views on others. This is what white nationalists want, a national identity for a white culture, whether that is in the US adopting that (most white nationalists), or having a small area break away and form an independent nation (white seperatists). They (for the most part) do not view other cultures as ""infearior"" but merely as ""different"" and that the differences should be respected and preserved. After all, we try to preseve our history, our environment, and most minority cultures (like some native american culture on reserves), so why can we not find a place to preserve a ""white culture""? Because stupid Hitler had to go and ruin that idea for everyone. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>...",1,Ore_Ele,"

So the one that he listed is not the only definition for Nationalism that would need to be met. The 4 deffinitions are [1]...  
  
•patriotism: love of country and willingness to sacrifice for it; ""they rode the same wave of popular patriotism""; ""British nationalism was in the air and patriotic sentiments ran high""  
•the doctrine that your national culture and interests are superior to any other  
•the aspiration for national independence felt by people under foreign domination  
•the doctrine that nations should act independently (rather than collectively) to attain their goals  
  
And we also find other definitions elsewhere. And we can see a simple trend in the definitions. It is a philosophy centered around a desire of national identification (meaning having an independent state) focused on either region, culture, or the current government. Since we are talking about ""White Nationalism"" this should obviously focus down to culture, since there is no ""White"" region in the world. And since ""white nationalism"" is often viewed against ""multiculturalism,"" that only more strongly affirms that WN is focused around cultures.  
  
I would disagree that White Nationalism is exculsively focused around the belief that a white culture is superior to every other culture. We can see from the many definitions, that ""superiority"" only really pops un in one of the many definitions.  
  
I would like to open arguments by looking at various types of Nationalism in history, to show that ""superiority"" over others in not inherent to that word. Particularly, Irish nationalism and the American Revolution.  
  
Irish Nationalism [2] - ""political and social movements and sentiment inspired by a love for Irish culture, language and history, and a sense of pride in Ireland and the Irish people. Today, the term generally refers to support for a united Ireland."" Please note, that none of this involves a sence of superiority or a claim of ""we're better than you."" In fact, most Irish Nationalist, while many do hold some resentment against Britian (namely because they view Britian as the obsticle in preventing them from having their own nation), they really don't hold anything any view against American culture, or Chinese culture, or really any other culture.  
  
If we go to the American revolution, that was also a large nationalist movement to gain independence from England and to establish their own nation so that they could have their own rights. They did not view that they were superior to everyone else (I'm sure some individuals did, but the movement as a whole did not) [3].  
  
If we expand that understanding of ""nationalism"" to ""white nationalism,"" we see that white nationalism is really nothing more than the advocacy of a national identity of the white culture (remember, that nationalism is tied to either culture or region).  
  
We then come to having to ask, what is ""white culture"" and does it even exist? It may sound strange, since, in America, we are very much ""multi-cultured,"" though we can get an idea that white culture does exist by looking at other cultures that we clearly know exist. We can clearly see that there is a hispanic culture, and that there is an african culture, and that there is an asian culture, and that there is a native american culture, so it should be only all too natural that there would be a white culture too. And within each of those larger cultures, there are many subcultures. For example, Chinese culture and Japanese culture, both fall under ""asian culture"" but are still different. And so we would also expect different subcultures within white culture.  
  
Third, I'd like to point out that wanting a place of your own (in this case, for your own culture) does not mean that you view others (in this case, other cultures) as infearior. If I want a house just for myself, that does not mean that I want my neighbor to not have a house, or that I think I'm better than him. It simply means that I would like a place of my own, and I can have no problem with him having a place of his own, or, if he would like, he is free to live in a community dwelling (i.e. multiculturalism). We can see this mentality a lot on state levels. Many states have different views on medical marrijuana, or minimum wage, or what have you. And so many of them choose what they want for themselves and they don't go trying to force other states to change. We see this a lot on the national level. We have our ""house"" (our nation) and we do with it as we please, and we don't try to force every other nation to do what we think is best (minus the occational dictator or two). This shows that we can have a single view for improving ourselves, without trying to force those views on others.  
  
This is what white nationalists want, a national identity for a white culture, whether that is in the US adopting that (most white nationalists), or having a small area break away and form an independent nation (white seperatists). They (for the most part) do not view other cultures as ""infearior"" but merely as ""different"" and that the differences should be respected and preserved. After all, we try to preseve our history, our environment, and most minority cultures (like some native american culture on reserves), so why can we not find a place to preserve a ""white culture""?  
  
Because stupid Hitler had to go and ruin that idea for everyone.

According to scientific evidence, the only way to end global warming is through nuclear war. That's a good thing. The global cooling caused by these high carbon clouds wouldn't be as catastrophic as a superpower-versus-superpower nuclear winter, but ""the effects would still be regarded as leading to unprecedented climate change,"" research physical scientist Luke Oman said during a press briefing Friday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C. Earth is currently in a long-term warming trend. After a regional nuclear war, though, average global temperatures would drop by 2.25 degrees F (1.25 degrees C) for two to three years afterward, the models suggest. At the extreme, the tropics, Europe, Asia, and Alaska would cool by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees F (3 to 4 degrees C), according to the models. Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic would actually warm a bit, due to shifted wind and ocean-circulation patterns, the researchers said. After ten years, average global temperatures would still be 0.9 degree F (0.5 degree C) lower than before the nuclear war, the models predict. (Source: <URL>... ) Second, Nuclear War is good because it will end the suffering of humanity much more quickly than humanity would end otherwise. Apparently, by the year 2050, petroleum deposits will have been substantially depleted and there will be famines. Nuclear War prevents this by reducing the population size greatly and killing off people quickly and painlessly. He is being evil by trying to prevent nuclear war.

I can post this if he wants :)       Nuclear War  Turn this entire contention because Nuclear War is a good thing.   According to scientific evidence, the only way to end global warming is through nuclear war. That's a good thing.   
  The global cooling caused by these high carbon clouds wouldn't be as catastrophic as a superpower-versus-superpower nuclear winter, but ""the effects would still be regarded as leading to unprecedented climate change,"" research physical scientist Luke Oman said during a press briefing Friday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C.  
  Earth is currently in a long-term warming trend. After a regional nuclear war, though, average global temperatures would drop by 2.25 degrees F (1.25 degrees C) for two to three years afterward, the models suggest.  
  At the extreme, the tropics, Europe, Asia, and Alaska would cool by 5.4 to 7.2 degrees F (3 to 4 degrees C), according to the models. Parts of the Arctic and Antarctic would actually warm a bit, due to shifted wind and ocean-circulation patterns, the researchers said.  
  After ten years, average global temperatures would still be 0.9 degree F (0.5 degree C) lower than before the nuclear war, the models predict.  
            (Source:   http://news.nationalgeographic.com...   )  Second, Nuclear War is good because it will end the suffering of humanity much more quickly than humanity would end otherwise. Apparently, by the year 2050, petroleum deposits will have been substantially depleted and there will be famines. Nuclear War prevents this by reducing the population size greatly and killing off people quickly and painlessly. He is being evil by trying to prevent nuclear war.

255,"Thanks again to my opponent for this interesting and enjoyable debate. ""I am not debating the human's life cycle, rather the reason for the human's life."" Me too and as I said survival and reproduction are reasons for the continuation of human life. Organisms exist so that cells can duplicate themselves more effectively. This is a reason for life. ""Pleasure is a temporary experience, and is forgotten almost instantly, and when one dies what did his pleasures matter?"" Pleasure is not purely temporary. Recalling pleasurable experiences can bring renewed pleasure. Long lasting pleasure can be achieved through a loving relationship, through childbirth as discussed previously and also through less tangible means like the satisfaction of past achievements. People often talk about one's life 'flashing before your eyes' when you face death. In this instance a life filled with pleasure would surely give more satisfaction and meaning than a life filled with self-denial and declined opportunities. ""According to my opponent's arguments, a sterile person has no meaning to his life."" Childbirth was only one of several ways I suggested that a person could find meaning in life. While a sterile person's life may have no biological purpose, it can still be filled with meaning. Also by adopting or otherwise raising a child as your own a person can experience all the emotional life-affirming benefits of having children of their own, not least the satisfaction of nurturing and caring for an individual who may go on to have kids themselves. ""TEMPORARY desires are meaningless"" No, permanent desires are meaningless because they can never be attained. ""The words of King Solomon are complex to the extreme-there are many opinions as to what he is trying to say. I will go by the view that says as follows..."" As my opponent accepts that his interpretation of 'The Philosopher's' words is only one of many and I have provided a perfectly valid alternative interpretation, I don't think he can build much of a case around Ecclesiastes. Negated. ---------------------- The meaning of life is of course totally subjective and I think arguing that any one thing is the only true meaning of life is intrinsically flawed as well as impossible to prove. One's life has meaning only to the extent that one applies meaning to it. My opponent has not explicitly stated what he believes the meaning of life to be, but as he states that it precludes atheism and everything temporary, I can only assume that it is something along the lines of 'serve God so you can go to Heaven'. The problem with this is that a life lived for this purpose only has meaning if your beliefs are in fact true. Imagine there's no heaven (RIP J.L.) If this is the case then a life devoted to reaching Heaven is entirely meaningless. All people of faith must experience doubt at some point and I would have thought that these doubts would become most acute when death is immediately anticipated. If you hold the conviction that there is no afterlife then a life of duty, devotion and sacrifice to religion is pointless and without meaning, as I argued regarding Ecclesiastes. To conclude this debate, I will draw on the work of some of the many philosophers who have considered this age old question and come to conclusions that are completely at odds with my opponent. These are all from Wikipedia (lazy I know) but can easily be backed up elsewhere. ""In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the Idea (Form) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value. Human beings are duty-bound to pursue the good, but no one can succeed in that pursuit without philosophical reasoning, which allows for true knowledge."" <URL>...

""the Cynic philosophers said that the purpose of life is living a life of Virtue that agrees with Nature"" <URL>... I believe that if the whole meaning of your life is to ensure survival in the afterlife, then your life itself has no meaning. It exists only to reach that end. If you think you've led a good life up to now and your only reason for living is to serve God and enter Heaven, then presumably you would not object to your otherwise meaningless life ending right now. For most theists this is not actually the case. However meaning can be found in life through many things, from reproduction to artistic achievement and from altruism to hedonism.

260,"I greatly disagree with your statement. Yeah, one of the potential outcomes of bullying is gaining personal strength from it, but it's not very likely. Term 'bullying' can include one or more of the following terms: ""Violence, extortion, exploitation, abuse, torture, hazing, mental tormenting, harassment, humiliation, dehumanization and social humiliation or defacing. A victim may be bullied by a single offender or by a group of offenders, privately or in front of audience (that may or may not be encouraged to join). To point #1 : Children have plenty of opportunity to confront with others. Every child encounters injustice, disagreement and probably a fight, too. That's plenty of room for the kid to learn how to react appropriately. No bullying is needed for that, and in fact bullying is far beyond acceptable as it may likely to cause the victim a severe emotional trauma with life-time consequences, from sleep, mood and eating disorders to the point of actually committing suicide. The children are the most fragile victims. An experience with bullying can negatively impact victims self-esteem, self-image, development, personality and even abilities in adult life. Every therapist will always examine the patient's childhood assessment, because emotional traumas from the childhood are the hardest to overcome and known for scaring the individual soul at most. Point #2 : There's no such instinct. The instinct tells you to live in your natural habitat (the community), to get along and to belong. And again, bullying doesn't help it at all. While negative feedback is appropriate and helpful for an individual to understand what's acceptable and what isn't, bullying doesn't belong to functional human civilization. Point #3: That's very incorrect. When a bully scares the victim ""to death"" and makes threats e. g. - ""if you tell your parents I'll shoot your dad/mum; or I'll tell my brother who's just out of jail to do this and that"", the parents won't know and they'll wonder why the kid acts strange, why doesn't eat or sleep or behaves in a strange fashion. And bullies often keep their victims in such a deadlock which gives them opportunity to further subdue and control the victim. This obviously damages the child permanently. I'd like to believe you don't endorse bullying. I hope you just didn't realize what's the actual extent of bullying, and maybe confused it with some sort of friendly ""yanking one's chain"".",1,grotto77,"

Each reading by the radiometer triggers Web Cam 3 to take a photograph.

As for the ocean, humans have never been to the bottom of the ocean, besides, it gets extremely dark and an enormous amount of pressure is placed on objects as depth increases. This argument is irrelevant in terms of Santa because we know where Santa supposedly lives, however we used to have a web cam on his location, and still haven't seen him. The Reuters article, while certainly entertaining, has some flaws, and I encourage those of you who will vote to read this article. The two big points made from it are stretching the space-time continuum and nanotechnology. ""'He understands that space stretches, he understands that you can stretch time, compress space and therefore he can, in a sense, actually have six Santa months to deliver the presents,' Silverberg told Reuters."" Obviously by this statement, WE as humans understand these things, yet we can't slow time... how is this justified? ""'We believe that he uses nanotechnology to grow the presents under the tree and really, what he's done, is he's figured out how to turn what we call irreversible thermo-dynamic properties into reversible ones and so he really starts with soot, candy, other types of natural materials, he puts them under the tree and he actually grows them in a reverse process to create the presents, wrapping and all.'"" It stands to reason that across the world, hundreds of thousands of humans are working on nanotechnology. Nothing has ever been made using nanotechnology. How is one person supposed to have done this all by himself, let alone mass produce it? [1] The above arguments refute everything my opponent has stated. To extend my argument, I'd like to use some analytical thinking. Santa has existed for as long as anyone can remember. For all of my opponents arguments to be true, Santa would have to be using nanotechnology and bending the space-time continuum for decades! Undoubtedly, anyone who could perform such a feat would have contracted at least a minor case of God Complex. My opponent assumes that Santa has been using complex technology for DECADES!

As for the ocean, humans have never been to the bottom of the ocean, besides, it gets extremely dark and an enormous amount of pressure is placed on objects as depth increases. This argument is irrelevant in terms of Santa because we know where Santa supposedly lives, however we used to have a web cam on his location, and still haven't seen him.  
  
The Reuters article, while certainly entertaining, has some flaws, and I encourage those of you who will vote to read this article. The two big points made from it are stretching the space-time continuum and nanotechnology.  
  
""'He understands that space stretches, he understands that you can stretch time, compress space and therefore he can, in a sense, actually have six Santa months to deliver the presents,' Silverberg told Reuters.""  
  
Obviously by this statement, WE as humans understand these things, yet we can't slow time... how is this justified?  
  
""'We believe that he uses nanotechnology to grow the presents under the tree and really, what he's done, is he's figured out how to turn what we call irreversible thermo-dynamic properties into reversible ones and so he really starts with soot, candy, other types of natural materials, he puts them under the tree and he actually grows them in a reverse process to create the presents, wrapping and all.'""  
  
It stands to reason that across the world, hundreds of thousands of humans are working on nanotechnology. Nothing has ever been made using nanotechnology. How is one person supposed to have done this all by himself, let alone mass produce it? [1]  
  
The above arguments refute everything my opponent has stated.  
  
To extend my argument, I'd like to use some analytical thinking. Santa has existed for as long as anyone can remember. For all of my opponents arguments to be true, Santa would have to be using nanotechnology and bending the space-time continuum for decades! Undoubtedly, anyone who could perform such a feat would have contracted at least a minor case of God Complex. My opponent assumes that Santa has been using complex technology for DECADES! He'd be bound to come out and claim all the fame and glory associated with such an astounding discovery. Just some food for thought...  
  
For clarification, I am a guy

I don't think any of Pro's examples provide proof that music itself motivates people to commit violent acts, (the references to sex crimes and drug abuse appear to have been dropped.) Music works on the emotions and I suppose in some isolated cases, it could be possible that music could provide a trigger, an emotional response that makes the listener more likely to act upon intentions they already have.

Bears on the other hand have no magic."" A flying unicorns magic isn't exactly useful in the contest of a fight. It would seem that the unicorn's magical abilities are only healing poisons and making water drinkable with its horn (1). These magical abilities would not help the unicorn to win the fight. The flying unicorn's ability to fly is still relevant, but I will explain in my points later why its ability to fly won't help it. ""Every time the unicorn goes down for a strike it stabs the bear in one arm."" A unicorn horn is not the easiest weapon to use. It is attached to the head and the neck, and the neck is not nearly as maneuverable as an arm. On top of that, the unicorn horn has no edges; that is to say, the horn needs a direct stab to do any damage. As the neck is not as easy to maneuver accurately as an arm, the horn needs a direct stab to do any damage, and the flying unicorn is a very large creature with high momentum but low maneuverablity, the flying unicorn would be unable to hit the slightly more maneuverable bear (this will be explained later). Now, here is why a bear would win in the fight. 1. A bear has better natural weapons. A unicorn only has its horn as a weapon, and this has already been explained to be an ineffective weapon. A bear, however, has claws, sharp teeth, and, on top of that, its natural strength. 2. Bears are crazy good at Kung Fu I would like to direct my opponent's attention to Kung Fu Panda. Apparently, these bears can fight. They can jump around like crazy (which can counter the flying unicorn's ability to fly and allow it to dodge the unicorn's horn) and they can duke out some serious blows (2). Essentially, a bear could straight up knock the unicorn unconcious, which would, effectively, end the fight. I will conclude this by saying that all of Pro's points have been refuted, and all of my arguments still stand as valid. Please vote Pro. Sources: 1. <URL>... 2.

The poem embodies Sufi thought, alongside mysticism, and preaches an open love. It also asks an important existential question, and seeks to determne ""what we are"". More analysis later to come, allow me to post the poem. Once more I shall explain later, but Baba Bulleh Shah is one of the most esteemed Muslim saints, he is given great respect throughout the Muslim world, and his poetry is praised throughout for its mental indepth. Bulleh Ki Jana Mein Kon? (Bulleh Who Knows Who Am I?) by Baba Bulleh Shah translated by Mahmood Jamal Bulleh, Who knows who I am? Not a believer in the mosque am I, Nor a disbeliever with his rites am I. I am not the pure amongst the impure, Neither Moses nor Pharaoh am I. Bulleh, Who knows who I am? Not in the Holy Books am I, Nor do I dwell in bhang or wine, Nor do I live in a drunken haze, Nor in sleep, nor waking knwon. Bulleh, Who knows who I am? Not in happiness or in sorrow am I found. I am neither pure nor mired in filthy ground. Neither made from earth or water, Nor am I in air or fire to be found. Bulleh, Who knows who I am? Not an Arab, nor Lahori Not a Hindi or Naghouri, Nor a Muslim, or a Peshawari, Not a Buddhist or a Christian. Bulleh, Who knows who I am? Secrets of religion I have not unravelled, Nor have I fathomed Eve, and Adam. Neither still nor moving on, I have not chosen my own name! Bulleh, Who knows who I am? From first to last, I searched myself, None other did I succeed in knwoing. Not some great thinker am I, Who is standing in my shoes, alone? Bulleh, Who knows who I am? Here is an audio: I t really is a beautiful poem. For those confused, Bulleh does not mean anything here, it is the poet addressing himself. Bulleh Shah wrote in the classic kafi style of poetry which was both exciting, and original. He is one of the foremost Punjabi poets, and his works on the Quran, Hadith, and mystic ideology is revered throughout Pakistan. He is also knows for his criticism of classic Muslim dogmatists, where in another poem he urges them to ""read your Self"" even if you ""have read a thousand books"". He marks an important point in metaphysical thought. The entire poem asks who one is? It questions how one ought to define oneself. In the end who is one from the inside? Bulleh Shah acquired many disciples many of whom were Hindus, he preached love for everyone through his poetry and his sermons. He also uses many metaphors like ""fire"" to refer to angery, hatred, and distrust, and ""water"" to show flow, happiness, contentment. The motif that no one is perfect, that each person has their flaws, and that we are all in between somewhere is evident. In the end when we must unite in Spirit then we must not consider which country we are from, or anything such. Bulleh Shah wasa firm believer that humans are not to be held how they are born, but who they choose to be. He was vehemently opposed to the cast system, and chose to walk around barefoot. Bulleh Shah was also a descendnt of the Holy Prophet Mohammad (pbuh). In that age there was a custom that any person who is a descendent of the Prophet will not be taught by an ordinary man, no matter how pious. Bulleh Shah broke this custom and took Hadhrat Inayat Shah Qadri, a great man, but not a descendent of the Prophet as his mentor. He constantly preached that how or what we are born is, is not us, but we choose to be one or the other. He humbly admits that he is more of a mystic that a scholar, and that his focus is in ""loving the Divine, and fearing that my eyes should ever turn anywhere else"". Through out the poem the message of universal love is preached, the lesson that we choose to be who we are, and that we must analyze ourselves before anything else. Just as Socrates says: 'the unexamined life is not worth living"", Bulleh Shah speaks to us for understanding Ourselves. In that there is the annihilation which Sufis are obsessed with, to reach a point where we forget who we are, or what we are. ""It is you alone, Not I, my love. You are; I'm not"" As the above excerpt from another poem exemplifies the meaning of this poem, we must annihilate ourselves after identifying who we appear to be. We must become lost in the Divine, in Love and in nothing else. This poem is a summary of that entire message and more, it is a guide to the path, and an argument, it is beauty, it is simply Divine. I hope you enjoyed. Ajab",1,Ajabi,"

Not in the Holy Books am I,   Nor do I dwell in   bhang   or wine,  Nor do I live in a drunken haze,   Nor in sleep, nor waking knwon.   Bulleh, Who knows who I am?   Not in happiness or in sorrow am I found.   I am neither pure nor mired in filthy ground.   Neither made from earth or water,   Nor am I in air or fire to be found.   Bulleh, Who knows who I am?   Not an Arab, nor   Lahori     Not a Hindi or Naghouri,  Nor a Muslim, or a   Peshawari,   Not a Buddhist or a Christian.   Bulleh, Who knows who I am?   Secrets of religion I have not unravelled,   Nor have I fathomed Eve, and Adam.  Neither still nor moving on,   I have not chosen my own name!   Bulleh, Who knows who I am?   From first to last, I searched myself,   None other did I succeed in knwoing.   Not some great thinker am I,   Who is standing in my shoes, alone?   Bulleh, Who knows who I am?   Here is an audio:   I  t really is a beautiful poem. For those confused, Bulleh does not mean anything here, it is the poet addressing himself. Bulleh Shah wrote in the classic   kafi   style of poetry which was both exciting, and original. He is one of the foremost Punjabi poets, and his works on the Quran, Hadith, and mystic ideology is revered throughout Pakistan. He is also knows for his criticism of classic Muslim dogmatists, where in another poem he urges them to ""read your Self"" even if you ""have read a thousand books"".   He marks an important point in metaphysical thought. The entire poem asks who one is? It questions how one ought to define oneself. In the end who is one from the inside? Bulleh Shah acquired many disciples many of whom were Hindus, he preached love for everyone through his poetry and his sermons.   He also uses many metaphors like ""fire"" to refer to angery, hatred, and distrust, and ""water"" to show flow, happiness, contentment. The motif that no one is perfect, that each person has their flaws, and that we are all in between somewhere is evident. In the end when we must unite in Spirit then we must not consider which country we are from, or anything such.   Bulleh Shah wasa firm believer that humans are not to be held how they are born, but who they choose to be. He was vehemently opposed to the cast system, and chose to walk around barefoot. Bulleh Shah was also a descendnt of the Holy Prophet Mohammad (pbuh). In that age there was a custom that any person who is a descendent of the Prophet will not be taught by an ordinary man, no matter how pious.   Bulleh Shah broke this custom and took Hadhrat Inayat Shah Qadri, a great man, but not a descendent of the Prophet as his mentor. He constantly preached that how or what we are born is, is not us, but we choose to be one or the other. He humbly admits that he is more of a mystic that a scholar, and that his focus is in ""loving the Divine, and fearing that my eyes should ever turn anywhere else"".   Through out the poem the message of universal love is preached, the lesson that we choose to be who we are, and that we must analyze ourselves before anything else. Just as Socrates says: 'the unexamined life is not worth living"", Bulleh Shah speaks to us for understanding Ourselves. In that there is the annihilation which Sufis are obsessed with, to reach a point where we forget who we are, or what we are.   ""It is you alone,  Not I, my love.   You are; I'm not""   As the above excerpt from another poem exemplifies the meaning of this poem, we must annihilate ourselves after identifying who we appear to be. We must become lost in the Divine, in Love and in nothing else. This poem is a summary of that entire message and more, it is a guide to the path, and an argument, it is beauty, it is simply Divine.   I hope you enjoyed.

Take the civil war, for example. The events that led to such a ""civil unrest"" were similar in that the majority was in direct conflict with the idea of equality. Although my opponent fears for an ""inevitable"" chaos following the legalization of gay marriage, there is a more subtle chaos at work as things are now. The popular sentiment clashes with the core value of equality. The civil war demonstrated the struggle between the two ideals. Take, for example, the following quotes. >>>The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession said that the non-slave-holding states were ""proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color"", and that the African race ""were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race"".<<< (1). Abraham Lincoln, 1855: >>>As a nation, we began by declaring that ""all men are created equal."" We now practically read it ""all men are created equal, except Negroes."" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ""all men are created equal, except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics.""<<< (2). Although the oppressed demographic was different then than it is now, the same basic idea applies. So was it wrong to abolish slavery? Of course it wasn't. 2. Definition of Equality: My opponent states that the definition of equality is uniformity. However, this is only one take on the definition of equality. Equal opportunity is not so static as to deny others the lifestyle of their choice. I define equality as a complex consideration of ability, situation, etc. It's not fair to deny someone something because they aren't exactly like you. 3. Homosexuality is innate: I have seen any logical reasoning on my opponent's side to say that it isn't. The fact that such a ""correlation"" exists just lends support to my argument. Thus, it is not immaterial to this debate. 4. Children and animals CANNOT give consent: First off, children and animals both lack the cognitive abilities to give legal consent when it comes to marriage. Particularly in the case of animals, seeing as my opponent confuses instinct with consent. Homosexual marriage is between two consenting adults. 5. Polygamy and Polyandry: There is a reason that polygamy is not allowed besides that it would ""re-define"" marriage. One person cannot collect insurance benefits from multiple spouses. That is a blatant cheating of the law. Again, legalizing homosexual marriage would still require monogamy. 6. Education: We have already indoctrinated our youth and society with homophobic propaganda. Conclusion: Gay marriage is an extremely important issue in society today. Homophobia and anti-gay violence is a common and remarkable occurrence. The grounds of denial of consenting and monogamous individuals are littered with hypocrisy, fear, and inequality. America should no longer allow such grounds and stick to the value of true equality. I thank my opponent for a wonderful debate. =) Sources: (1) - <URL>...

A) Sexual Discrimination -- discrimination (usually in employment) that excludes one sex (usually women) to the benefit of the other sex ; Sexism is commonly considered to be discrimination and/or hatred towards people based on their sex rather than their individual merits (Google). Under the provided definition of sexual discrimination, the bar's refusal to grant admittance to men does not warrant such a claim. First, this 'discrimination' has nothing to do with employment opportunities. Second, not allowing men into a lesbian bar does not benefit women, but rather protects them. The act also does not promote hatred against men based on their sex, so first, Pro must prove that sexual discrimination actually even took place. B) Here in the states, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (namely Title VII) discusses what is and isn't permissible in terms of discrimination. An employer, for instance, cannot discriminate based on one's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. They can, however, discriminate based on one's political affiliation, sexuality, and handicaps, for example. Thus even legally - in addition to morally - one has the right to deny entrance into their own private institution. :: POINT 2 :: It's a LESBIAN bar. Pro attempted to enter a lesbian bar. A lesbian is defined as a female homosexual. Assuming that Pro did not attempt to pass as a female (and prove that he was one), or indicate that he was even a homosexual, we can reasonably conclude that Pro was trying to trespass into an institution that is not open to men. So keep this in mind: A) Brian and his friend(s) could presumably meet and befriend lesbians in many other locations - not just this one lesbian bar. B) Like I said, a lesbian bar is a place specifically for lesbians... or at the very least, females. While this may seem unethical, we must also consider other places in society which discriminate admittance or service based on gender. For instance, a female might be refused service at a barber shop because the barber wishes to cut only men's hair. Instead, the woman might be directed to a beauty salon. This is not an example of sexual discrimination, but rather different institutions catering to different wants and needs of the public. C) Women/lesbians might seek refuge at a lesbian bar to avoid the coming-ons of men... meaning this safe haven serves one population of the public - not all. To eliminate such a place would actually be discriminatory against lesbians or females in general -- after all, if places still exist that are for men only (i.e. professional sporting leagues), then to not allow such places for women would be biased and unfair. :: POINT 3 :: The rights of owners/customers. A) As I've mentioned, females may seek refuge at a lesbian bar for a variety of reasons. Who is to say that a woman should not be able to enjoy something without the imposition of male presence? Again the precedent for this lies in other institutions in society. For instance, a female may have no shot at pledging a fraternity, because of the strictly enforced all-male policy. Fraternities are not legal institutions - they are private. Thus businesses are also private - or should be - and owners and patrons alike should have the right to exclude whom they want. B) To elaborate on that point, I'd like to point out why business owners should be allowed to deny admittance of men into a lesbian club. First, they are not making money off it; in fact, they may be losing money (entrance fees, drinks, etc.). Thus the management's sole concern are their patrons. Second, like I said - women might be uncomfortable being in the presence of men. If so, they might not return to the bar/club, meaning management would actually lose money in the future. Unless Brian and his friends would be willing to compensate for the loss of profit, admitting men into this institution would be unprofitable and immoral against business owners. C) In response to my opponent's claim, ""Women are allowed to go into gay bars so men should be allowed into lesbian bars,"" I would like to reiterate that it should be up to the bar's particular management whom they would like to admit. Remember that bars who refuse patronage are taking the risk of assuming the consequences, whatever those might be (i.e. loss of profit, negative portrayal in the media/society, etc.). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I'll leave it at this for now...

However, these limits are set if there is something that desturbs the peace. By yelling fire someone is probably going to get get hurt when people stat screaming and running out the theater, on the other hand what is the consequences from burning the national flag? There are none! Burning the flag is a peaceful way to say 'I hate the government' or ' i'm unhappy with it's choices'. Therefore, since it's not hurting anyone then it should be legal. Mr. Rehnquist was wrong when he said this. When something goes wrong or the government is bad or when someone just disagrees with the government. They look at the nation as a whole. Same with other countries when they see the actions of our government they don't blame political parties they see the nation as a whole. What better way to say your unhappy with the way things are going then to burn the symbol of that which is making you unhappy? My point is that even though we can't yell fire in the theater, this is because it has more severe consequences then burning the flag. Since burning the national flag doesn't hurt anybody it should be legal. My opponent says that burnng the flag is not exercising the first amendment rights. This false because it is possible to speak wth one's actions, and if this is denied then the people's freedom of speach is denied. People have a right to protest, and people have a right to voice there distaste for the government. Not everyone loves the government or it's symbol anf they shouldn't be silenced.

There are none! Burning the flag is a peaceful way to say 'I hate the government' or ' i'm unhappy with it's choices'. Therefore, since it's not hurting anyone then it should be legal.  Mr. Rehnquist was wrong when he said this. When something goes wrong or the government is bad or when someone just disagrees with the government. They look at the nation as a whole. Same with other countries when they see the actions of our government they don't blame political parties they see the nation as a whole. What better way to say your unhappy with the way things are going then to burn the symbol of that which is making you unhappy?  My point is that even though we can't yell fire in the theater, this is because it has more severe consequences then burning the flag. Since burning the national flag doesn't hurt anybody it should be legal.  My opponent says that burnng the flag is not exercising  the first amendment rights. This false because it is possible to speak wth one's actions, and if this is denied then the people's freedom of speach is denied. People have a right to protest, and people have a right to voice there distaste for the government. Not everyone loves the government or it's symbol anf they shouldn't be silenced.  By outlawing flag burning we are doing just that, we are silencing people in a way. Our founding fathers wouldn't aprove.",Society,2,Flag-burning/17/,12327
285,"Greetings! I thank my opponent for accepting. I wish him the best of luck! I shall then start with a poem of my favorite lyrical poet: William Butler Yeats. The poem uses extensive metaphor, and allusions alongside powerful imagery combined with powerful verse. Aedh Wishes For The Cloth of Heaven Had I the Heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with golden and silver light, The blue, and the dim, and the dark cloths Of night, and light, and the half light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. I am tempted to leave this poem without any analysis, so well does it speak for itself, and yet I find myself writing out what is surely blasphemous with regards to this poem. Let us then start with the title of this poem; by the title we may determine that the narrator of this poem is Aedh. This is significant, since we know that W. B. Yeats was Irish[1], and Aedh is a god in Irish mythology.[2] In fact Aedh is the god of death, and it is said that anyone who should hear him play his harp shall be doomed.[3] Why would then Yeats use Aedh to narrate this love poem? Does it seem right that death itself is narrating a poem? Well firstly the allusion is rather deeply rooted in Irish mythology. Aedh's mother, angry at Lir (his father) turned him, and his siblings into swans who shall roman the English Channell, here it is said that Aedh picked up on all the lanuguages of Ireland, as well as learnt the Arts, so much so that he created the harp.[4] Yeats then uses Aedh to attempt to show to us the personality of the narrator (which Yeats himself identifies himself). The narrator is perceived as cold, and is yet passionate: he is pale, lovelorn, in the thrall of ""la belle dams sans merci"". For one who would be Aedh how great would the cloths of Heaven be? Connection it with the allusion, Yeats moves on to use powerful imagery. The poem begins by the narrator wishing for the ""cloths of the Heavens"" note how it uses the word ""Heavens"" instead of ""Heaven"" once more reinforcing the universality. This ""cloth"" is a symbol which could mean many different things, but since its comparison is with ""dreams"" later on, it would suggest that this cloth is the aspiration of Heaven itself. I take this to mean that Aedh says had I been so great, not so forlorn, not so pale, that I had the aspirations, the ""cloths"" of Heaven, which would have the majesty of the Heavens, for the cloth is ""enwrought with golden and silver light"", and would yet be universal, and without pretense, for they would have not only the majesty, also symbolized by the color blue, but would be ""universal"" with the ""night, and light"", and of twilight. This imagery has been used to show the cloths to be the most precious things in existence, majestic, universal, without pretense and with grand beauty. This was the first of three parts of the poem. It starts of with a wish, it starts off by contrasting the dead, cold appearence that Aedh might have by showing him in the light of ardent desire and passion. It then moves on, and becomes an offer. Here the beauty of the beloved is emphasized, for they are taken to be even more precious than what the narrator originally wished for, so much so that Aedh would have been willing to ""spread the cloths under your [the beloved's] feet"". Again the passion even in one who is supposedly emotionless is shown. Aedh proudly declares that should he have that which is most precious he would not hesitate to put it under his beloved's feet. ""But I, being poor, have only my dreams"" How can I explain it any better than it explains itself? The emotion, the passion, the bitter-sweet tone. At once Aedh affirms his own poverty in such matters. He affirms that he does not possess what is worthy of the beloved, that he is poor when it comes to all such things, for he was cursed. He does however has his dreams. By this for him, his dreams are as important as the cloths of Heaven. He says he has laid his dreams under his beloved's feet. The last part of the poem is a request, now that the poet has given all he had of value to his beloved, he begs that they be careful. ""Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."" [1] <URL>...

287,"Here I shall prove that Capitalism is the better than Communism. Economically Although some capitalism elements are present in other economic systems through history, it only truly developed itself in with the industrial era. With industries, millions of people could stop working for their Lords in Europe(specially in Britain) to work on factories. In the beginning there was some exploitations, but with the increasing amount of enterprises and the market being more and more competitive, wages started going up and working hours down! In Britain, estimates that salaries rose 15% to 150% between 1780 and 1850. And all without unions or labor rights.(1) In Brazil, where I live, when industrial capitalism truly came during the 70's, our life improvement never rose so much. In countries where the economy was basically rural, the industries provided jobs with bigger salaries than in the agriculture and were able to produce goods in mass, thus making prices fall and giving the possibility to more people to acquire it.(2) Socially Capitalism improved people standards of living.(3) When agriculture became mechanized, more food was produced, thus their prices fell and made it affordable for poor people and hence improved their health, as they could eat more. The rise of wages (which I explained in my previous argument) enabled people to pay for better health care, afford medicine, school, books and goods that make our lives comfortable, such as televisions or Iphones. It gives the opportunity for people who were born nobodies to become famous liders or entrepeneurs, such as Margaret Thatcher, Barack Obama or S.B. Fuller. Politically Capitalism gives political liberty. With better wages provided by free-market, more people can afford reading books and studying on free time, giving them some political knowledge and the possibility to form their political opinion. The better wages also gives people political power against a tyrannical State which would take their money away and give them to other people. Yes, there will always be poor people, but capitalism gave them higher standards of living. More people with more money stop the state from getting too big. Only a big state creates and perpetuate the poverty and take away people's freedom. Capitalism provides people the possibility of choice. They can choose to like the government, to vote, not to vote, candidate themselves and even criticising capitalism! No other system can provide this. Morally People are free, not equal. As I stated before, capitalism provides freedom, which is natural to every human being. But equality no. We are naturally unequal. If we have different colors, ages, tastes and opinions, Way should we live in a socioeconomic system where everyone is the same? In capitalism you can choose not to like capitalism, but in socialist countries you can't chose to dislike socialist/communist tyrannical government. Even the differences between poors and riches are moral. If I was smarter than everybody else on having an idea that would benefit a lot of people, why shouldn't I receive a lot of money from this people? Of course, the poors should be helped, but in true capitalism they are helped by selflessness charity. The destruction of capitalism A lot of people have been working on the destruction of free-market economy and true capitalism. This is causing more poverty, more wars and more tyrants.

""An estimated 65,000 gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons are currently serving on either active or reserve duty, and it is estimated that there are another one million gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans.""[1] A poll taken by The Washington Post/ABC, conclude that in 2008, ""Seventy-five percent of Americans believe that [homosexuals] should be allowed to serve in the US military."", openly, 78 percent believed they should serve. I do not dispute that there would not be an outcry of dissents if the entire ""D.A.D.T."" was lifted, but polls are polls. This particular poll chooses it's demographics. Here is a poll that, a: requires participant to seek the poll[2](i.e. not random phone call to whoever is home at the time)b:allows for more specified answers c: so far has sampled 200% more participants. <URL>... Only 40% of respondents support a complete lift on the ban. The rest still support some aspect of the ban. I fall in the 2% that believe Homosexuals should serve openly, but that homosexual conduct (as well as heterosexual conduct) should be banned between active soldiers, and sodomy should remain banned outright. The reason why I would change the policy to allow soldiers to state their orientation is because of the potential that one can blackmail a fellow soldier or officer. I'm sure I'm in agreement with my opponent that our soldiers will perform their duties regardless of the regulations or knowledge of each others sexual orientation. And it seems that for the most part that this is exactly what has evolved from the initial policy in question. It is the other aspects that I believe must remain. Participating in sodomy is a health concern.[3]The Congress has the obligation to retain the good health of soldiers and make any rule in pursuit of ""prepar[ing] for and to prevail in combat should the need arise""[4]. The activity would also put other soldiers in unnecessary risk. The duties required by many and possibly most aspects of military operations puts soldiers at risk to exposure to disease host. There is no reason to increase this hazard by allowing personnel to engage in such risky behavior. This portion of the D.A.D.T. should not be changed. Male Homosexual acts should remain banned because the behavior demonstrates the propensity or intent to engage in sodomy. Since Lesbianism does not demonstrate the propensity or intent to engage in sodomy, females could be exempt. The military should not be burdened with having to prove an actual event, so male homosexual activity should remain banned in it's entirety. I will pass on the financial aspect. I am sure my opponent would agree that if it were to be shown that it would cost more to lift the ban, it would not discourage her opinions. >>>>> >Lifting the ban ensures that Arabic linguists and other critical specialists are not fired for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Lifting the ban protects 65,000 service members from being fired by the largest employer in the country for being lesbian, gay, or bisexual.<<<< I agree, however I don't think the military has crippled itself by firing legions of homosexual linguists. The US military is not an employer. There is no Constitutional right to serve. The 14th amendment does not prohibit the government from "" tak[ing] away your natural born rights such as Life, liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness."", and it certainly doesn't trump Art. 1 sec. 8 par. 14; ('Congress shall have the power..."")To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces. If we were to concede to both a right to serve and a right to serve ""gay"", this would completely disrupt both military and civic affairs. Would it not be construed to shield any activity deemed ""gay"" from disciplinary actions, no matter how disruptive to the ""high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion.""[4] One of the websites my opponent endorsed demands that Congress ""Amend military medical and uniform regulations that discriminate transgender[sic] servicemember[s][sic]""[5]. Yes, we should allow men to wear female uniforms. This won't invite any disruption in the daily activities of the military. Klinger never achieved his goal. The military cannot be burdened with the problems that ensue when the privilege to serve becomes a right. Certain provisions of the ""D.A.D.T."" policies should remain enforced for ""[t]he primary purpose.... to prepare for and to prevail in combat should the need arise."" Including any activity that puts the soldiers at unnecessary risk. Homosexuals in the military should be able to state their orientation, but ""homosexual acts"" should continue to be banned. All acts of sexual nature both heterosexual and homosexual should be banned between soldiers while on active duty. Congress has full authority to do as it desires and it should remain that way.

I will pass on the financial aspect. I am sure my opponent would agree that if it were to be shown that it would cost more to lift the ban, it would not discourage her opinions.  
  
>>>>>  
>Lifting the ban ensures that Arabic linguists and other critical specialists are not fired for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Lifting the ban protects 65,000 service members from being fired by the largest employer in the country for being lesbian, gay, or bisexual.<<<<  
  
I agree, however I don't think the military has crippled itself by firing legions of homosexual linguists. The US military is not an employer. There is no Constitutional right to serve. The 14th amendment does not prohibit the government from  
"" tak[ing] away your natural born rights such as Life, liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness."", and it certainly doesn't trump Art. 1 sec. 8 par. 14; ('Congress shall have the power..."")To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.  
If we were to concede to both a right to serve and a right to serve ""gay"", this would completely disrupt both military and civic affairs. Would it not be construed to shield any activity deemed ""gay"" from disciplinary actions, no matter how disruptive to the ""high morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion.""[4] One of the websites my opponent endorsed demands that Congress ""Amend military medical and uniform regulations that discriminate transgender[sic] servicemember[s][sic]""[5]. Yes, we should allow men to wear female uniforms. This won't invite any disruption in the daily activities of the military. Klinger never achieved his goal.  
The military cannot be burdened with the problems that ensue when the privilege to serve becomes a right.  
  
Certain provisions of the ""D.A.D.T."" policies should remain enforced for ""[t]he primary purpose.... to prepare for and to prevail in combat should the need arise."" Including any activity that puts the soldiers at unnecessary risk.  
  
Homosexuals in the military should be able to state their orientation, but ""homosexual acts"" should continue to be banned.  
  
All acts of sexual nature both heterosexual and homosexual should be banned between soldiers while on active duty.  
  
Congress has full authority to do as it desires and it should remain that way.

This is asinine to the extreme. CON would either like you to believe that i) by killing living beings in their prime, you learn the value of life, or that ii) ""killing for the glory of God"" is the path to forgiveness and salvation. i) By this measure, Cain learned the value of life by killing Abel, and that what Cain did by killing Abel was righteous, as much so if not even more so than Abel's killing of animals for the glory of God. This is a moral contradiction in CON's argument, as Cain was condemned for such killing and not held to be righteous. ii) If there is such a thing as ""killing for the glory of God"", perhaps we can say that Osama bin Laden ""killed for the glory of God"" when he carried out the 9/11 attacks, or that we ""killed for the glory of God"" when we dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To describe such acts as ""Biblically moral"" would more than likely rub most people the wrong way. The morality that CON wants you to think the Bible is advocating is absurdly contradictory and can be used to justify the most heinous acts of genocide and terror. One need only look at Joshua's treatment of Canaan to see how such Biblical morality can justify what most people would consider to be the pinnacle of immorality: ""... in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them--the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God. "" (Deuteronomy 20:17-18) ""... they set fire to the city and burned it to the ground, along with everything in it... "" (Joshua 6:24) The Jews of Joshua bear much resemblance to the pastoral Mongols of Genghis Khan, who were also genocidal, monotheistic, and marauding. What is Detestable is Arbitrary What were these ""detestable things [the Canaanites] do in worshiping their gods?"" We can look to Cain and Abel and a bit of Jewish history to get an answer. The Jews were pastoral. They managed livestock while in Egypt, and took what animals were under their care when they left (Exodus 12:31-32). Job's wealth was measured in the livestock he managed, not in the numbers of acres he tilled (Job 1:1-3). The Jews evidently favored meat and livestock over farming. And so, of course Cain the farmer is evil, and Abel the shepherder is good in the eyes of a Jewish God. This is all Biblical morality boils down to when it comes to the story of Cain and Abel - Cain was evil because he was a farmer. Such a standard of morality is absolutely arbitrary...the civilizations of Eden (i.e. the Tigris and Euphrates, Genesis 2:14) that grew crops in the Fertile Crescent would have considered the Jews and their marauding ways to be evil, a sentiment which manifested in the Jews' Babylonian captivity and enslavement (book of Daniel). Killing out of Love 7) CON: "" The Torah is actually rooted in love and compassion, not in commandments. What pleased God was not the fact that Abel killed animals, but that he recognized his own sinfulness and was willing to accept the consequences of his actions, sacrifice an animal, and repent of his ways..."" Again, this is absolutely asinine. Perhaps dropping the a-bombs and flying airplanes into skyscrapers were ""sacrifices"" done as ""acts of love and repentance"". Or perhaps it is only when a Christian does it. Again, this ""standard"" of morality advocated by CON is totally arbitrary. Etc 8) CON argues that "" no matter what happens, Cain will always choose to do evil, not that God is preventing him from doing good."" This fully supports that God created Cain to be evil, that God created evil at the very least in the instance of Cain. An omnibenevolent God does not create evil...this is a Biblical contradiction. 9) CON then concludes that "" The Bible gives very good explanations as to why Abel would not have killed Cain based on his nature, "" yet CON does not describe what this nature is. The explanation is simple. Abel descended from Adam...Abel was sinful like Adam. Cain was a farmer, and farmers are ""bad"" to pastoral societies. So Cain was banished to the east (which happens to be where the Fertile Crescent was located). Conclusion CON does not contest that a) Abel was descended from Adam and thus was sinful like Adam, and that b) human nature is sinful and acquisitous according to the Bible. Abel managed flocks, and Jews were pastoral. Abel was thus ""good"" and Cain ""evil"". Such is the depth of Biblical morality. Had God looked upon Cain's offering with favor instead of Abel's, Abel's sinful nature would have compelled him to kill Cain. My argument holds.",1,wrichcirw,"

You seem to think that there aren't, so to give you some small statistics: In a survey in Seattle alone, created and carried out by Safe Schools Washington, 4.5% of students from years 9 - 12 identified themselves as Gay. A national survey found that around 80% of homosexual people discovered that they were Gay in primary school/junior school/ secondary school. So I just named but a few statistics which prove that there are gay teenagers who self-identify. <URL>... Also, he expects us to accept this as evidence the child was ""born that way."" I looked back at every argument I made, and not once did I say this. Even though I believe that Gay people are born that way, I did not include it in my arguments as I didn't think it would be relevant to the point at hand. Stop lying to prove your ridiculous points. I would ask my opponent this question. ""Suppose the child self-identifies as a Ninja Turtle, do we start feeding him pizza topped with flies?"" This is silly. If a child identifies themselves as a ninja turtle (and is being wholly serious), then they need some psychological help. A child who identifies themselves as Gay is not the same thing, as they are sexually attracted to the same sex. Stop inflating my points to a degree that makes no logical sense to prove a point as well. My opponent works on the assumption that all schools have ""gay children"" who are being bullied and discriminated against. He provides no evidence to back up this claim. Well, firstly, if we are judging on assumptions, you take the biscuit. You assume that all homosexual relationships are loveless and revolve around sex. You assume that homosexuals are destroying our society through HIV. If you need some evidence to support a claim which is obviously quite factual, here are some more statistics: <URL>... You place such an emphasis on facts, yet you are totally ignoring them! And incidentally, when did bullying become a strictly gay thing and why do gay students allow themselves to be bullied in the first place? It would appear that this so-called bullying epidemic is yet another way gay activists like my opponent gain access to our schools. Bullying was never strictly a ""gay"" thing. If you will look at the above statistics you will find that Gay people are 2x more likely to be bullied, as homosexuality is still not accepted by the wider community. What do you mean ""Why do gay people allow themselves to be bullied in the first place?"" You are placing the blame on the victim rather than the perpetrators. That statement could also be placed on heterosexual bullying. Kids go through changes. The kid who self-identifies as gay today may self-identify as straight tomorrow. They should have that freedom, This is true. But at 14/15 we trust a child when they say that they are straight, so why not if they say that they are Gay? They do have that freedom, and the so called ""Gay activists"" are not taking that away from them. You act like these people are heartless monsters who would brand a child Gay without the child's permission or knowledge, which just isn't true. The point is, is that whether these children believe they are homosexual or not, this type of Imagery needs to be shown in the media to remove hate and discrimination.

Finally, it should come as no surprise my opponent invokes African HIV in a debate that has nothing to do with African HIV.

You obviously haven't seen the basis of this, even though I stated it in the same paragraph. 97% of HIV rates were found in Africa or low-middle countries, where they can't afford to educate their children about safe sex. This means that the homosexuals in that country who have HIV and go on to have sex will spread that around. It is not misdirection, it is a logical procession from the information we have. Therefore the HIV rates found in homosexuals will also rise significantly. You need to do more research in this case sir.

Supporters hope the   so-called   personhood initiative will succeed in a   Bible Belt   state that already has some of the nation's toughest abortion regulations and   only a single clinic   where the procedures are performed.  ""  4. Perry slashed environment enforcement in Texas  ""  Gov. Rick Perry   likes to say   the best way to promote economic growth is to reduce   regulation  .     When it comes to the   environment  , Perry has made   Texas one of the most industry-friendly states   in the nation.  ""  So that's really a 100% Left Wing bias.   So now let's look at the Fox News opening headlines;  1. Reid Offers Teachers' Salaries as First Vote on Obama's Divvied-Up Jobs Bill  ""Senate Democrats will try to move a component of President Obama's $447 billion bill -- $35 billion in aid to state and local governments to rehire or retain teachers and first responders -- as early as this week, disappointing Republicans who say another piece of the apple would've had a better chance for success.""  2. Obama's First 1,000 Days Marked By Federal Spending Spree, More Unemployment  ""President Obama hit his 1,000-day mark Monday, and with new data showing hikes in poverty, foreclosures, joblessness and debt, the president has a little over a year to convince Americans that he is turning the country in the right direction.""  3. Cain Squeaks Ahead of Obama in New General Election Poll  ""Businessman Herman Cain is leading President Obama in a new head-to-head poll, with seniors and independents taking a particular liking to his unconventional candidacy. ""  4. Sen. Thune: We Need to Repeal Obamacare  Had to search for this one, since it wasn't on the page like Pro said it was; turns out it was a video, so I can't copy the text, but it was a   opinion   show as expected, ""Your World with Neil Cavuto"" is an opinion program, not a news program.  I will ask my opponent to please give an exact links to his sources instead of these vague links.   Again I went to his listed source, davehitt.com, and it was nothing more than, ""a Portal for all of Dave's Online Projects and Web Sites"", and the portal had links to various opinion blogs and podcasts - not the most reliable sources - these blogs had topics such as ""Brian on things atheists didn't do"", and ""Police State News"".   FOX News Is biased, no one will dispute that fact... However they are not the Most biased, they are simply the most Right wing, in a mostly Left wing Media.  If you compare MSNBC and FOX News during the 2008 Presidential Elections who would see that MSNBC was far more bias than FOX News.

  According to eM&P's article ""Bias on MSNBC & Fox News - An Empirical Analysis of the Content Found on Cable News""  
     
  This compared 2 shows from MSNBC and 2 shows from Fox News;  
  MSNBC  
  
  The Rachel Maddow Show (9pm)   
  Hardball with Chris Matthews (5pm & 7pm)  
  
  FOX News  
  
  The O’Reilly Factor (8pm)   
  Hannity (9pm)  
  
     
  Found here:   http://www.emandp.com...     
     
  The study was broken up into 3 groups; tone, objectivity, and overall Political bias.  
     
  Tone  
  The analysis shows that both networks present overwhelmingly negative coverage of the news and politics.  
     
  Objectivity  
  Subjectivity is defined as any opinionated commentary as compared to objective, fact-based statements. Here, we see both networks relying heavily on subjective content in their newscasts.  
     
  Political Bias  
  The charts below show that both networks contain a great deal of partisan bias in their reporting.  In keeping with popular perceptions, MSNBC reports much more positively on the Democratic Party and Fox News reports more positively on the Republican Party.  Interestingly, in both cases we see the cable networks spending more time denigrating the opposition party than praising the party they tend to support.

303,"First of all, I would like to say how pleased I am that Mr. Latham decided to accept this debate as I recently took the time to post a serious debate only to get an opponent who replied with a load of old nonsense in return. True, I won the debate, but I would rather lose to a worthy opponent than win by default. Nevertheless, I will still try and win this one by addressing Mr. Latham's rebuttals as follows: 1 - The term investment bank seems to still being used in the media to describe banks, or the divisions of banks, that deal with institutional investors and high net worth individuals rather than provide bank accounts, loans and mortgages for ordinary customers. In any case, when these banks were bailed out they certainly were known as investment banks. <URL>... 2 - There is only one thing that bankers hate more than paying tax and that is what they would describe as ""government interference in their affairs"". That is why some banks were reluctant to take the public cash offered them - they suspected that the government would demand some control over how their business was run in the future. However, given their woeful record of catastrophic mismanagement over the preceding years, the government had no option but to persuade them to accept the money and ask them to use it to recapitalize themselves. The reason why some banks had to be coerced into this is that the banking industry which is a public utility as well as a commercial venture and a collapse would have caused a total economic meltdown. It is also true that Goldman and Morgan took relatively little compared to others such as Bank of America. On the other hand, banks such as Barclays Capital took absolutely nothing and even bought much of Lehman's business off the administrators. However, the point is that the banks that were loaned money took it on the understanding that they would use it to recapitalize in order to prevent any repetition of the financial chaos that had ensued - it was certainly never intended that profits earned on the loans would be distributed between the very bankers who were responsible for the collapse. 3 - Goldman wanted to repay their loans as quickly as possible so that they could release themselves from any government intervention and thus be free to pay themselves huge bonuses. This is why Goldman's 30,000 UK employees will get an average 500,000 ($820,000) each, although in reality, the bonuses will not go to the back office boys and girls or the folks that work in the post room or staff restaurant, but instead be will be divided between the top traders in multiples of tens of millions. That is exactly the type of bad management decision that caused the economic collapse in the first place - the banks should be using that money to recapitalize themselves in case the recession is 'W'-shaped and they need cash to sustain themselves through more lean times. The fact is that these banks were financed by the public and have a duty to act responsibly in return. They have not discharged this duty and should, therefore, suffer the consequences in the form of a windfall tax. 4 - A windfall tax may be unconstitutional in the US - my opponent is American and I am not so I will not argue with him on that point. However, a windfall tax was applied to the banks in the UK in 1981 under similar economic circumstances. <URL>... 5 - A condition of the bail out of the banking industry, the top executives did, indeed, agree to limit their pay - in other words ""mend their ways"". They have reneged on this agreement but the government must take some of the blame for this because they should never have trusted them in the first place - they should have made it a legally binding agreement - after all, a typical bankers' whole raison d'tre is to let nothing stand in their way of making as much money for themselves as possible - they have no sense of social responsibility, indeed, it could be said that their consciences are their accomplices rather than their guides! 6 - The 50% would be taken on post-tax profits. So if a bank announces that it has made a $50 billion profit after tax, $25 billion will then be due to the government and $25 billion will be for the bank to either recapitalize themselves or, as is more likely, to pay themselves (still massive) bonuses. This is the reason why regulation to moderate remuneration will still be required. 7 - The difference between an overpaid rock star or sportsman and an investment banker is that if a celebrity chooses to spend his money on private planes and ocean-going yachts and lavish parties rather than invest it sensibly and they go to the wall as a result, it is only they that suffer. However, when banking executives do the same we all suffer. In conclusion, I accept that windfall taxes are inherently unfair - if they are applied retrospectively to squeeze money out of prudent companies who have made big profits as the result of their own endeavours. That is why I do not propose to apply such taxes to banks such as Barclays Capital who didn't have recourse to the public purse because they were able to sustain themselves through, and even profit from, the collapse of the banking industry. It is only the incompetent, greedy banks that were obliged to go cap in hand to their governments and who now, despite all that has happened, are awarding themselves massive payouts, that should be subject to a windfall tax.

306,"Thanks to my opponent for actually providing something which resembles a rebuttal. ""Any way you see it, killing is morally wrong."" Actually, I just presented a way I see that killing would not be morally wrong. ""Instead of killing him, you should put him in jail."" I am not debating between killing him and putting him in jail. This debate is not about whether killing someone is worse than sending them to jail; sending him to jail was in fact never on the table. I am debating between killing him and letting him go about his merry way. In a utilitarian sense killing him is obviously the better moral choice. (1) Therefore it is not bad.

Thanks to my opponent for actually providing something which resembles a rebuttal.  
  
""Any way you see it, killing is morally wrong.""  
  
Actually, I just presented a way I see that killing would not be morally wrong.  
  
""Instead of killing him, you should put him in jail.""  
  
I am not debating between killing him and putting him in jail. This debate is not about whether killing someone is worse than sending them to jail; sending him to jail was in fact never on the table. I am debating between killing him and letting him go about his merry way. In a utilitarian sense killing him is obviously the better moral choice. (1) Therefore it is not bad.

I think chewing gum would be a bad idea to have in school. If gum chewing was allowed, not all kids would be chewing every second of the day. Say a class was taking a test and a particular girl was not chewing gum but the person beside of her was. The girl taking the test becomes distracted. This is because many times people are not only chewing their gum, but also smacking. A gum smacker is not only distractive, but is annoying. The test taker is now distracted and annoyed, so her test score will be much lower. Gum chewing is extremely unsanitary. The wrappers will pile up in classrooms and hallways. Also, when kids are done with their gum, they don't want to get up in the middle of class and go throw their gum away, so they simply stick it under their chair or desk and leave it there.

On the other hand in his response to my contention [C] he argues for raising the standard on exit exams. Throughout his arguments he keeps advocating to make tests harder while at the same time making them easier. As I've proven even raising the standards have no effect. The problem is the test themselves. ""Young high school graduates who obtained their diplomas in exit exam states fared no better in the labor market than their peers who obtained their diplomas in other states.

I strongly dispute this claim as it has been proven that learning under stressful conditional conditions impairs just that, learning. [1, Figure 2] Pro goes onto to continue to say that the test can ""be repeated many times"". But if a student continues to repeat a test with the sole purpose of passing are they really learning? It becomes this rhythmic process where students just try to learn the answer; A, B, C, or D rather then learn the information. Pro attempts to refute the fact that the exam does not have a significant factor on a students life. Then I ask you about the girl from Minnesota who would've lost an entire year of her life having to repeat a grade she didn't need to because someone messed up grading a test.

He will decide with Ukrainian government officials are about to turn this day into a national holiday since America has successfully eradicated the pro Russian rebels. This caused around a decline of 100,000 to the population with people going to Russia or being killed, but finally order is being restored. Things seemed to be looking up for Ukraine. Or so they THOUGHT! May 14 Mr. Almighty went on a plane heading for Kazakhstan to negotiate a treaty. Not trusting Russia they sign a few simple agreements with Georgia and Azerbaijan to let them bring a squadron of planes to accompany them for security. Those countries get 2.5 million each for the trip to Kazakhstan. They give word to Kazakhstan about this for their ships not to fire at theirs. While flying over the Caspian Sea they decide to go more towards the south of Kazakhstan to avoid Russia from attacking them. All is going well until the ships begin to fire at the planes. They begin to take evasive maneuvers while radioing Kazakhstan making sure none of their ships are attacking. They confirm whoever is firing on them is not them. They quickly land at the nearest airport in Kazakhstan shaken up. They were planning on doing something different, but instead they sign an agreement for almost 1 million giving those on the Ukrainian planes protection and whatever they need until the country responsible was found. May 18 Soon people demand who tried to attack the Ukrainian planes. At first many blame Russia, but satellite footage at that time showed that all Russian ships in the Caspian sea were at port at that time. Azerbaijan is ruled off along with Iran since they would be notified by Azerbaijan would have known if they were there. Leaving the prime suspect as Turkmenistan. May 20 Turkmenistan begins mobilization. May 23 Seeing this Ukraine begins their own mobilization. May 24 An ultimatum is sent to Turkmenistan to stop its mobilization and an apology or face war. May 25 Turkmenistan ignoring this ultimatum leads Ukraine to declare war. May 26 Turkmenistan declares war back and thus began the Ukrainian-Turkmenistan war. May 30 Ukraine won't have access to it's fleet since this will be in the Caspian Sea, so they begin mass producing Oplot-M tanks. Also Ukrainian the more modern aircraft are also mass produced. To be ready to attack Turkmenistan they sign an agreement with Azerbaijan worth nearly 100 million to have there soldiers there. Once the Turkmenistan fleet is dealt with they will attack from somewhere else. Your turn for defensive preparations. I will not attack until round 3. -Mr. Almighty",1,Russia_The_almighty,"

Let the WAR BEGIN!!!!!!  
  https://www.youtube.com...  
  
I will state the cause of the war.  
  
May 11 The epic diplomat known as Mr. Almighty (I'll make this a crossover from my Serbia vs Croatia) has taken the job of being a diplomat for Ukraine for now. He will decide with Ukrainian government officials are about to turn this day into a national holiday since America has successfully eradicated the pro Russian rebels. This caused around a decline of 100,000 to the population with people going to Russia or being killed, but finally order is being restored. Things seemed to be looking up for Ukraine. Or so they THOUGHT!  
  
May 14 Mr. Almighty went on a plane heading for Kazakhstan to negotiate a treaty. Not trusting Russia they sign a few simple agreements with Georgia and Azerbaijan to let them bring a squadron of planes to accompany them for security. Those countries get 2.5 million each for the trip to Kazakhstan. They give word to Kazakhstan about this for their ships not to fire at theirs. While flying over the Caspian Sea they decide to go more towards the south of Kazakhstan to avoid Russia from attacking them. All is going well until the ships begin to fire at the planes. They begin to take evasive maneuvers while radioing Kazakhstan making sure none of their ships are attacking. They confirm whoever is firing on them is not them. They quickly land at the nearest airport in Kazakhstan shaken up. They were planning on doing something different, but instead they sign an agreement for almost 1 million giving those on the Ukrainian planes protection and whatever they need until the country responsible was found.  
  
May 18 Soon people demand who tried to attack the Ukrainian planes. At first many blame Russia, but satellite footage at that time showed that all Russian ships in the Caspian sea were at port at that time. Azerbaijan is ruled off along with Iran since they would be notified by Azerbaijan would have known if they were there. Leaving the prime suspect as Turkmenistan.  
  
May 20 Turkmenistan begins mobilization.  
  
May 23 Seeing this Ukraine begins their own mobilization.  
  
May 24 An ultimatum is sent to Turkmenistan to stop its mobilization and an apology or face war.  
  
May 25 Turkmenistan ignoring this ultimatum leads Ukraine to declare war.  
  
May 26 Turkmenistan declares war back and thus began the Ukrainian-Turkmenistan war.  
  
May 30 Ukraine won't have access to it's fleet since this will be in the Caspian Sea, so they begin mass producing Oplot-M tanks. Also Ukrainian the more modern aircraft are also mass produced. To be ready to attack Turkmenistan they sign an agreement with Azerbaijan worth nearly 100 million to have there soldiers there. Once the Turkmenistan fleet is dealt with they will attack from somewhere else.  
  
Your turn for defensive preparations. I will not attack until round 3.

322,"First of all let me begin my addressing by opponent's opening quote by Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson was a staunch non-interventionist and believed that although we should promote healthy relationships with all nations.. we should have entangling alliances with none. Therefore any evidence relating to works of this Founding Father belong to the negative. Moving on to my opponents first point relating to the fact that if government is amoral then it also must have amoral policies. This statement is absolutely correct. Allow me to explain. The definition of morality as accepted by my opponent is "" a duty to act based on one's beliefs"" to allow government to have ""personal beliefs"" is to threaten the justice of which my opponent so highly speaks. Consider the Spanish Inquisition. During this time period the government took on the morality of the Catholic church, and as such felt that it was the GOVERNMENT's OBLIGATION to promote this religious morality. The end result was unlimited government which was permitted to torture, burn, drown, and destroy those who opposed this morality. We cannot put a moral face on government without jeopardizing human rights and justice. Speaking of justice... my opponent upholds that Justice and morality are basically one and the same. However I disagree. Once established, government becomes a monopoly regarding coercive force. There's nothing optional about government. Government is the arbiter of justice, and justice is based on laws, police, prosecutors, courts, jail and other penalties. Justice might possibly claim to be 'informed' by morality, but for the reasons already stated, justice is not morality. Only institutions composed of one or more people who have made the free will decisions to associate can arbitrate morality, because according to the accepted definition of morality only individuals can make personal decisions relating to their duty. This is why government is an institution of laws not of morals. Under this point, my opponent affirmed that ""Human rights legislation and capital punishment laws are other important areas of government action that cannot be separated from moral concerns."" However as was seen earlier in my example of the Spanish Inquisition, if we base our human rights legislation off what particular individuals believe to be moral it may actually violate human rights. For example, the Islamic form of government is based of the Koran, which is the Islamic code of morality, however as can be seen in recent events, this religion violates human rights. The majority of my opponent's response deals with the issue that aid to foreign nations, actually does protect national sovereignty. This is precisely the point that I explained in my 2nd Contention. Government has an obligation to protect from dangers without. If that means supplying assistance to our allies then it definitely falls under the protection of national sovereignty and of the citizens. However, when government is obligated to provide aid to EVERY country which is in need it forces government to look outside the needs of its own people and obligates it to provide aid to every nation, even those who may be our enemy and will use this aid for our destruction. If individuals seek to provide aid to those suffering in other countries.. indeed let them do so. Charity belongs to the individual not to the institution of government. Finally, I will respond to my opponents rebuttal of my Rwanda Example. The impacts of a serious string of actions violating national sovereignty has lasting impacts. Violence had been taking place before the actual genocide, however the outburst of feelings and resentment finally boiled over in 1994. So although the storm was several decades in coming, the actions of Belgium in the disruption of Rwanda's social structure was a key contributing factor to the Genocide. Therefore, my example still stands. I will conclude with a quote by President George Washington from his Farewell Address ""Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification""",1,Pepsi94,"

A1: Parole Boards are beneficial to a community Parole gives prisoners an incentive to behave and re-enter the community. Especially for younger people, to be stapled with a full-time sentence can ruin a life, for reasons like businesses not wanting to hire criminals. Without parole, prisoners, at the end of their sentences, would be without supervision and incentive to behave. With the Victorian example I am using, there is extensive measures taken to help prevent re-offence, too [2]. Therefore, using a Parole Board, a society can have effective rehabilitation that helps the community, as well as remove those who are likely to re-offend. C: Brief Conclusion Basically, Parole Boards are highly regulated and have strict rules enforced so as to avoid careless release of prisoners. They are not, as my opponent suggests, frivolous with their releases terms. Furthermore, Parole Boards give people second chances and incentives in the criminal justice system.

That means that if pro's team were to somehow take control of a member of my team, I can take control back immediately, using any of the members I previously mentioned.

Or he could use his ability to manipulate matter to defeat them with spontaneous combustion (ex: the way he killed Rorschach in the movie.) 4: Doctor Manhattan can stop time, and then vanquish my opponent's team to a far away planet. Mewtwo and Nezarr the Calculator then would destroy the planet with relative ease (after Manhattan ceases his stopping of time.) 5: the members of my team who can control members of my opponent's team would simply do so, and then make them fight to the death among themselves. There are many, many scenarios I could use which are similar to the one's I've put forth.

342,"I apologize for not posting in video/audio form, but i don't have access to a camera at the moment and I promise that my AC is in time. I affirm. I offer the following definitions to clarify the round: Felon: a person who has committed an act deemed illegal by that person's government Democratic Society: Society governed by all citizens using the system of voting Democratic: the ability to have a say in what action is occurring Right: an ability or state you can maintain because a government enforces that ability or state Equality: the quality of being the same in measure, value or status Observation: The resolution states ""felons ought to retain the right...in a democratic society"" This does NOT mean any society we currently are residing in or know of today. The resolution does NOT state that United States felons ought to retain the right to vote, nor that any other specific members of specific societies are relevant to this debate. The value for the round is Human Rights as defined by the UN Declaration of Human Rights. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations released said declaration, setting a standard for all democratic and non-democratic nations everywhere. It has 30 total articles, but for this debate I will focus on the following: ""Article 21, Sub Point 3: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures"" To put it simply, all people should have the right to vote in any governmental election. This also has been clearly acknowledged as a human right. The Criterion is Equality. Democracy is founded upon the principle of equality, since equality shows that all people are of the same value. Democratic acts allow all people to have an EQUAL say in what is occurring. This proves a direct relation to the resolution and therefore is the clear, best choice for today's criterion. Contention 1: ""Felons are still citizens"" Therefore, we cannot rightfully discredit a felon's input on government simply because they have committed a crime. The basic purpose of voting is to gather input from citizens on the issues of their society, and if even one member of that society is a felon, they should still have the right to vote because they are still a citizen, they still are counted in the population and they still experience the results of the election. Furthermore, the commission of a felony does not render a felon incapable of having opinions on other social issues, thus a felon's opinion is still relevant to the society and therefore the felon should retain the right to vote. Because of this, equality is better upheld on the affirmative. Contention 2: ""The Prison system is a punishment system"" All people that are convicted of a felony are given a proper punishment based on the severity of the crime committed. If we were to add a separate and additional punishment to a punishment that they already have served, we are destroying the very system used to judge felons. Adding an addition punishment is destructive of a democratic society because it is neither equal nor democratic, as not all felons have committed the same crime. If we were to negate the resolution, we might as well stick all felons in prison for the rest of their lives because we aren't trusting them to do anything after they have been labeled a felon. Because negating is NOT proportional, equality is better upheld by affirming the resolution. Contention 3: ""Rational Choice Theory"" Rational Choice Theory is the basic process that a person does all the time. It basically shows that citizens only do something that is more beneficial to them than not. In this case, Rational Choice Theory can be applied in the way citizens vote. There is the intense (primary) benefit that each citizen has in an election, (like gay marriage for a homosexual voter or banning abortion for a pro-life voter,) an intrinsic (secondary) benefit, (meaning an issue that the voter has a stance on, but is not high priority) and a voting cost. (Like taking the time to register, standing in line or even filling out the ballot.) Citizens will only vote when the benefits outweigh the costs. The warrants and impacts for this are as follows; affirming allows all voters who have the moral and social standards to suffer the costs of voting in order to cast their vote. Negating however decreases the number of good voters (felon or not) by not retaining their right to vote. Equality is better upheld by the affirmative because all voters are given the ability to cast an equal vote if they choose to. (Meaning any non-voters are creating by choice, not force)",1,Charlie_Danger,"
  
I apologize for not posting in video/audio form, but i don't have access to a camera at the moment and I promise that my AC is in time.  
  
I affirm.  
I offer the following definitions to clarify the round:  
Felon: a person who has committed an act deemed illegal by that person's government  
Democratic Society: Society governed by all citizens using the system of voting  
Democratic: the ability to have a say in what action is occurring  
Right: an ability or state you can maintain because a government enforces that ability or state  
Equality: the quality of being the same in measure, value or status  
  
Observation: The resolution states ""felons ought to retain the right...in a democratic society"" This does NOT mean any society we currently are residing in or know of today. The resolution does NOT state that United States felons ought to retain the right to vote, nor that any other specific members of specific societies are relevant to this debate.  
  
The value for the round is Human Rights as defined by the UN Declaration of Human Rights.

Contention 2: ""The Prison system is a punishment system""  
All people that are convicted of a felony are given a proper punishment based on the severity of the crime committed. If we were to add a separate and additional punishment to a punishment that they already have served, we are destroying the very system used to judge felons. Adding an addition punishment is destructive of a democratic society because it is neither equal nor democratic, as not all felons have committed the same crime. If we were to negate the resolution, we might as well stick all felons in prison for the rest of their lives because we aren't trusting them to do anything after they have been labeled a felon. Because negating is NOT proportional, equality is better upheld by affirming the resolution.  
  
Contention 3: ""Rational Choice Theory""  
Rational Choice Theory is the basic process that a person does all the time. It basically shows that citizens only do something that is more beneficial to them than not. In this case, Rational Choice Theory can be applied in the way citizens vote. There is the intense (primary) benefit that each citizen has in an election, (like gay marriage for a homosexual voter or banning abortion for a pro-life voter,) an intrinsic (secondary) benefit, (meaning an issue that the voter has a stance on, but is not high priority) and a voting cost. (Like taking the time to register, standing in line or even filling out the ballot.) Citizens will only vote when the benefits outweigh the costs. The warrants and impacts for this are as follows; affirming allows all voters who have the moral and social standards to suffer the costs of voting in order to cast their vote. Negating however decreases the number of good voters (felon or not) by not retaining their right to vote. Equality is better upheld by the affirmative because all voters are given the ability to cast an equal vote if they choose to.

346,"PREFACE: In this debate it is to be understood that the terms ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"" are not simply statements of personal preference. They are statements of political (and therefore ethical) ideology. A person who is pro-life does not simply say that they would not get an abortion but they say that abortion should be illegal. A position in which a person would not get or approve of an abortion but would NOT persecute or prosecute a person who would get one is pro-choice. Consider these two scenarios: 1) You're in a burning building and have a choice to save one of two things; a 9-year-old girl or a cooler with 1000 viable human embryos: Which one do you save? 2) You are in charge of making decisions for a 9-year-old girl and she becomes pregnant from a rape with twins. Every prenatal doctor you take her to tells you that the pregnancy is life-threatening and that an abortion would save her life. Would you authorize the procedure or would you not? As I understand it, if one wanted to be consistent while holding a pro-life position they would/should choose the cooler in #1 and to NOT authorize the procedure in #2 or at the very least deride the person in a situation like #2 if they were to authorize the abortion. This assessment of the pro-life position is obviously predicated on the stated pro-life position that suggests that humanity begins or human rights are bestowed at the moment of conception. My basic contention is that a person holding a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) is either inhuman - given the logical, philosophical, and real life consequences of holding and/or implementing said position - OR they are simply ignorant of the consequences of holding and/or implementing their position. Now I'd like to take the time to make my position as clearly as I can at the moment. I leave it to my opponent then to show the flaws in my arguments. 1) I do not believe a fetus could be considered a fully fledged person until around the 28th week when the thalamus (the brain structure known to be responsible for routing sense information to the brain and regulating consciousness) is formed and functional. Without this structure there is no sense information, no emotional capacity, no pain perception, and no capacity for conscious thought therefore; therefore an abortion, before the 28th week of development is not murder nor does it cause suffering. I am open to pushing the time limit back from the 28th week however I think that topic is for a different discussion. <URL>... <URL>... 2) Pro-life hypocrisy: A) I consider it a hypocrisy on the part of the pro-life movement to desire to outlaw abortion because of the opinion they hold that the UNborn have rights over the rights of the mother's right of self determination. They tend to say things like, ""Who are you to decide for the unborn?"" I ask, ""Who are you to decide for all women?"" B) Should someone site religious grounds against abortion, I wonder if they feel any sense of reverence for religions that revere animals as reincarnations of humans and therefore consider it murder to kill them? 3) I do not support abortion being used as a form of birth control however illegalization is not the way to reduce and/or prevent the occurrence of this phenomena effectively. Before 1973 (Roe v Wade and Doe v Balton) legal abortions at that time ranged around 250,000/year and there were an estimated 400,000 - 1.2 million illegal abortions/year and because of the illegal abortions there were over 5000 deaths due to complications from botched abortion procedures on top of many more disfigurations and health complications. <URL>... v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton <URL>... : 4) Abortion is not used as a form of contraception. Pregnancy can occur even with responsible contraceptive use. Only 8% of women having abortions have never used birth control, and 90% of the women most likely to have an abortion are on birth control. <URL>... 5) I think Bill Clinton said it best when he said, ""Keep abortion safe, legal, and rare."" Based on the number of then legal and illegal abortions and the fact that abortion levels today are arguably not significantly higher now then they were before abortion was legalized, the idea that illegalizing abortions will stop abortions from taking place, reduce their number or solve a problem without creating several bigger ones in it's place is laughably unfounded. 6) Illegalizing abortion would demonstrably cause more problems than it solves given the number of unwanted children heaping more pressure on the state (through adoptions, juvenile crime, and impoverished families/mothers who can't afford a child), the extra stress on the healthcare system due to unsafe illegal abortions causing medical problems, and the civil liberties of rape victims who become pregnant and a woman's right to control their own reproductive health being violated. (If your objection is along the lines of, ""What about the civil liberties of the unborn."" see #1) Conclusion: The only way to responsibly, ethically and effectively reduce the number of abortions is to increase access to birth control and abandon abstinence only sex education programs (given their complete and utter failure) and replace them with proper sex education programs that inform young and even older people about birth control, the truth about it, and how and where to access it.

This is because they clean themselves [1]. 2) Cats are generally better looking than dogs. This is because ""whereas dogs have been bred for utility, cats have been bred solely for appearance"" [2]. 3) Cats do not require a human to exercise. The cat owner does not have to feed their cat. 4) Cats are significantly quieter. Dogs bark loudly when they are bored or insecure, but dogs are just prone to barking [4]. Cats make sounds that are much quieter and pleasing to the human ear [1]. 5) Cats are easier to clean up after. This is because they use a litter box [1]. Dogs pee to mark their territory[6] and are picky about where they poop[5]. 6) Dogs can not be left home on vacation. Unlike dogs, cats are independent and ""will not be traumatized"" if they are left alone when their owners are on vacation [1]. 7. Dogs submissively urinate [7]. 8. Cats are more intelligent than dogs [8]. 9. Cats will not beg their owners constantly for food [8]. 10. Cats show their affection better. This is because they choose to purr and rub themselves against their owners [1]. Dogs, on the other hand, lick their owners. This lick is unsanitary because dogs will lick their privates and eat other dog's poop [9]. Now, I will address my opponent's points. First, I would like to assert that keeping drugs out of America is not a good thing. Arresting a man for pursuing his own happiness is a violation of god-given rights, as defined in the American Declaration of Independence [10]. In pursuing his own happiness without any cost to others, the man is arrested. Dogs have been put to the use of destroying human rights and jailing innocent human beings. Second, I would like to point out that many of my opponent's points also apply to cats. These include his second, fifth, seventh, ninth, and tenth points. Third, I would like to point out that my opponent's sixth point, that ""Dogs are man's best friend"" is just a saying and has absolutely no meaning in this debate. After eliminating the points aforementioned, we can see that there are only ideas regarding what dogs can be trained to do. Cats can be trained just as easily as dogs; however, they must be trained using different techniques because they think differently [2] [11]. Cats, being more intelligent than dogs [2][8][11], are capable of learning a plethora of tricks [11] and can be trained to do anything a dogs can do. In conclusion, cats are lower maintenance, give better affection, and are more intelligent than dogs. Cats can be trained to do anything a dog can do. Dogs are used to destroy human rights.

349,"The main argument of the second paragraph is ""...popping is just impressive because of its 'magic' movements..."" However, the Melbourne Shuffle also includes what looks like ""magic"" movements. While dancing you ""step"" or ""stomp"" in a forward direction, however your body moves backwards. Your debate in the third paragraph just reinstates your first response, as seen in the first debate -> ""Also, it matches the style of accompanying music (usually hard trance or hardstyle) perfectly, with each glide matching the timing of the bass. Your last statement was ""After watching popping, someone says, 'Whoa... That guy did some crazy movements.' After watching the Melbourne Shuffle, someone says, 'Wow, now that's a cool dance that matches this genre of music.'"" Not necessarily. I am a street performer and the reactions I've received were very vast but mostly comments about how my popping goes amazing with the music I perform to. So once again, you're implying that one can only dance to hard and heavy bass genres of music. However with popping you can choose any genre. To the general audience the Melbourne Shuffle looks very repetitive. However, popping has many variations. If you refer to my video, you will see that the first scene of the video includes Liquid Style Popping, at 0:53 you will see Gliding mixed in with Liquid, and at 1:45 you will see Isolation and Bone Popping (aka True Popping). Every popper has their own style of popping, ie: Bone Breaking, unlike the Melbourne Shuffle in which you must combine a certain set of moves such as the T-Step, the Running man, Glides, and Spins. Also, in your first paragraph you stated ""...such as kicks and spins."" In the Melbourne Shuffle one does not kick, if kicking were to be mixed in with the Melbourne Shuffle it would easily be turned into a modified version of Jumpstyle. Technically you are not kicking, you're extending your leg and touching the ground with either toe or heel, which ever is more appropriate to combine a previous movement with your next one. A kick requires your foot to stay off the ground (see Jumpstyle dance as example : ). As you can see from the video provided as a link along with the Jumpstyle example, a kick is when your foot extends and does not touch the ground. My first argument was body control. As we have debated the voters can easily see that the Melbourne Shuffle only teaches you about leg and foot control. However, Popping teaches the performer about full body control with gliding, isolation, bone breaking, tutting, botting, and many more. Gliding teaches foot control (see example : ) . Isolation teaches the performer control over almost all the joints in the human body. Bone Breaking teaches control over the dislocate-able joint of the body (see link for example : ). Tutting teaches the performer wrist, knuckle, and finger control (See Example : ). Botting, the most common type of popping, it teaches the performer control over breathing and muscle control (see example : ). So once again, to restate my original debate, popping is one of the best solo dances one could learn because it teaches about complete body control.",1,Garipa,"
  
The main argument of the second paragraph is ""...popping is just impressive because of its 'magic' movements..."" However, the Melbourne Shuffle also includes what looks like ""magic"" movements. While dancing you ""step"" or ""stomp"" in a forward direction, however your body moves backwards.  
  
Your debate in the third paragraph just reinstates your first response, as seen in the first debate -> ""Also, it matches the style of accompanying music (usually hard trance or hardstyle) perfectly, with each glide matching the timing of the bass. Your last statement was ""After watching popping, someone says, 'Whoa... That guy did some crazy movements.' After watching the Melbourne Shuffle, someone says, 'Wow, now that's a cool dance that matches this genre of music.'"" Not necessarily. I am a street performer and the reactions I've received were very vast but mostly comments about how my popping goes amazing with the music I perform to. So once again, you're implying that one can only dance to hard and heavy bass genres of music. However with popping you can choose any genre.

1. Rules created hold power over all rules posted later, and no later rule can contradict an earlier rule.  
  
2. Both players should still have the ability to post rules in their turn.  
  
3. A violation of a rule that is not null and void will result in the rule-breaker losing this debate.  
  
4. A player may only do something besides make rules to discuss whether one has broken a rule, or whether a rule is null.  
  
5. Not counting these foundation rules, each player can only create 3 rules per turn.  
  
6. Each player must produce 3 rules per round or they forfeit.  
  
7. Rules cannnot result in an auto-win. Breaking a rule cannot result in the victory of the rule-breaker. Each player should have an oppportunity to not break each rule.

364,"Good afternoon. I'd like to thank my opponent for proposing such a unique topic to debate. I, too, hope that the debate will be an interesting one. I'll begin by addressing the arguments made by the Con, and then follow up with a proposal of my own. ------------------------------- Con's advocacy basically centers around the dangers of profiling with regards to two particular populations: police and predators. I have 4 responses: 1. There are a number of different things on a given vehicle that make profiling just as easy. Permits, both hanging and bumper sticker, are perfect examples. Those are just as visible as any decal that the state could place on a vehicle, and indicate the exact same thing: that the driver is most likely a youth. Yet, we do not outlaw high school campus parking decals. 2. Sexual predators are probably not cruising along the freeway at 75 mph looking for teens to molest. Their profiles tend to suggest something much more quiet and calculated, hence sexual predators will flock toward campuses and other vulnerable locations. I'd like my opponent to warrant this assertion. 3. The decal serves as a fair and appropriate warning that a given driver may not be as experienced as some of the others on the road. Though it is stereotypical, to a certain extent, to claim that all youth drivers are inherently worse than adult drivers (as we've all seen our fair share of terrible adult drivers), the statistics on the matter prove that youth drivers are more likely to commit driving errors than those of older demographics [1] [2]. The same rationale is used when marking any hazardous vehicle. We mark student driver cars extensively for the same reason (note that we haven't seen any molestation sprees spurred by predators following around student driver vehicles). This is a tactic, in fact, that will encourage more defensive driving, since drivers around the youth will be able to compensate for a possible lack of experience. Overall, it is an increase in safety. 4. My opponent states that any tickets which result in profiling will ""go through"" without any ability for the defendant to check that issuance. This is simply untrue. Nowhere in the Con's description of the law does it state that due process for a not-guilty plea is compromised. If a defendant truly believes that the ticket is bogus, then he/she has every right to challenge the citation. As an employee of the largest circuit court traffic department in the state of Oregon, I can tell you that traffic citations do get dismissed, and that young drivers can be acquitted. ---------------------------- The Pro offers an alternative provision of the law to strike, one which does not seem to protect the public, but compromises the functionality of the justice system. The Pro proposes that the only part of this law that is a poor idea on-face is the restriction of plea bargaining rights to youth drivers involved in motor vehicle violations. Plea bargaining is essential to efficient government function. Plea bargaining, in the context of a traffic citation, takes on a specific form. Because traffic citations are not criminal proceedings, there is no prosecuting attorney. A ""court date"" consists of the defendant and the judge. The defendant may plead guilty, not guilty, or no contest. Guilty and no contest waive the defendant's right to a trial with the issuing officer, and allow a ticket's case to be decided by the judge that day. No contest is simply a way of not admitting guilt while waiving this right to trial. Hence, plea bargaining is essentially the ability of the judge, within this context, to lower or discharge the fine associated with the ticket. To eliminate this ability, especially only for a certain demographic based on their supposed propensity to be more ""guilty"" than other drivers, is a usurpation of the judge's authority and a violation of the principles of justice that govern the nation.

2. All familes are different. Not every heterosexual house hold has a nurturing mother and protective father. Sometimes it's the other way around or 50/50. Since we are speaking from a personal experience point of view i have came across families were the mothers have had the upper hand in the household and the fathers were stay at home dads.

In order to create such a seemingly complex system, one would think that this god would have to have some level of intelligence, especially by meager human standards.  
Therefore, this reasonable person just now, using reason, came to the conclusion that there must be an intelligent creator. Therefore, evidence for creationism. I suppose, to use their own lingo, you could say that ""the evidence for creationism is all of creation.""

In fact, the embargo has made the Cuban people a bit more impoverished, without making them one bit more free. At the same time, it has deprived Americans of their freedom to travel and has cost US farmers and other producers billions of dollars of potential exports."" These are the words of Daniel Griswold in 2009, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies. First of all, I'd like to clarify what I mean when I say I want to lift the embargo. I intend to: Repeal the Cuban Democracy Act Repeal the Helms-Burton Act Amend the Foreign Assistance Act to exclude Cuba Amend the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 to exclude Cuba I would also like to clarify that this is not only ending the economic embargo, but also the travel embargo. This debate will be centered around these points: 1. The Embargo has already met some of it's original aims. Those that it has not met, it will not meet. 2. This is not only an economic problem in the U.S. and Cuba, (which it is), but it is also a worldwide economic problem. 3. The Embargo is internationally and domestically unpopular. 4. Ending the travel embargo with help with a transition to democracy. 1. The Original Aims of the Embargo. The embargo was first put in place in the 60's for two reasons. The first was to punish Cuba for seizing property owned by Americans. In 2001, Cuban Officials offered to compensate those Americans whose property was taken. For reasons unknown, this offer was declined. This goal has evidently been abandoned. The second reason was to make it costlier and more of a hassle for the Soviet Union to fund and participate with Cuba. This part worked wonderfully, it is estimated to have cost the Soviet Union six billion dollars a year. However, the S.U. disbanded in 1991, so this is no longer an issue. The only plausible reason the Embargo is still in place is to try and punish Cuba until it ceases to be Communist. This has failed for the past 48 years, and will continue to fail until Castro dies. 2. Obviously this is an economic problem in the U.S. and Cuba. This seems to be self-evident and I'd rather not try to expand on it. However, I would like to explain why this is an international economic problem. The Helms-Burton Act stops any company from dealing with the U.S. and Cuba at the same time. Obviously, this company is going to choose the bigger market; the U.S. Not only does this negatively affect Cuba and it's citizens, but it also affects foreign companies. It does nothing to aid international relations, and only aids the increase of international deficit. 3. In 2009 Moiss Nam, Editor-In-Chief of Foreign Policy Magazine and Former Venezuelan Minister of Development, said ""The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere."" The United Nations has voted 19 years in a row over 90% in favor of ending the embargo. During the last voting session this year (2010), only the U.S. and Israel voted to keep it in place, with only three other U.S. allies abstinentating. Also, according to a poll done by CNN, a majority of Americans want the travel embargo lifted. 4. By allowing U.S. travelers to converse with Cuban citizens, it can only help Cuba to become democratic after the death of Castro. An editorial in the Boston Herald in 2002 said, ""The more travelers there are (to Cuba) the more the truth will spread, and that can only help the transition of Cuba out of tyranny when the tyrant dies.""

As for my second argument, do you too find the Sickle and Hammer schnazy? <(||<) (>||)> You state that, ""the problem with communism is that it does not give one a chance to better themselves...you take away the difference between the rich and the poor, what will people aim for?"" I believe that money is a motivator for doing what you do not enjoy doing (namely work). It does not follow though that money is the only motivator. Here is a list of the top 7 reasons why employees leave their jobs (1): 1. The job or workplace was not as expected 2. Mismatch between job and the person 3. Too little coaching and feedback 4. Too few growth and advancement opportunities 5. Feeling devalued and unrecognized 6. Stress from overwork and work-life imbalance 7. Loss of trust and confidence in senior leaders I fail to see ""lack of pay"" as one of those. I do think Communism attests to one important feature of the working class: work we enjoy is work we'll do. For instance, I am a large fan of Excel spreadsheets. If I could spend my days in Excel and earn enough money to satisfy the needs of my family than what do I have to complain about? I love Excel, I love my family - my two chief loves(2) have been met. Senator Tom Coburn, another man who does what he loves, delivers babies in hospitals for free simply because he enjoys it (3). In a Capitalist Society we advocate the love of money (and the desires it feeds) as a driving factor for our economy. What has this produced though? - Poverty - Starvation - Murder - Abuse/Wide-Scale Violence - Class Division - Racism - Sex-ism - Child Prostitution - Slavery The list can go on, I assure you. What have you claimed Communism has produced? Laziness. I will gladly take this character flaw over the atrocities mentioned above. Communism for our Future! -Y 1. <URL>... 2.

First, I must unfortunately point out that you have not addressed my first critique of your argument - namely that the fact that Communism has (according to you) failed in one country does not imply it will fail in another (and indeed fail completely).  
  
As for my second argument, do you too find the Sickle and Hammer schnazy?  
  
<(||<) (>||)>  
  
You state that, ""the problem with communism is that it does not give one a chance to better themselves...you take away the difference between the rich and the poor, what will people aim for?""  
  
I believe that money is a motivator for doing what you do not enjoy doing (namely work). It does not follow though that money is the only motivator. Here is a list of the top 7 reasons why employees leave their jobs (1):  
  
1. The job or workplace was not as expected  
2. Mismatch between job and the person  
3. Too little coaching and feedback  
4. Too few growth and advancement opportunities  
5. Feeling devalued and unrecognized  
6. Stress from overwork and work-life imbalance  
7. Loss of trust and confidence in senior leaders  
  
I fail to see ""lack of pay"" as one of those. I do think Communism attests to one important feature of the working class: work we enjoy is work we'll do. For instance, I am a large fan of Excel spreadsheets. If I could spend my days in Excel and earn enough money to satisfy the needs of my family than what do I have to complain about? I love Excel, I love my family - my two chief loves(2) have been met. Senator Tom Coburn, another man who does what he loves, delivers babies in hospitals for free simply because he enjoys it (3).  
  
In a Capitalist Society we advocate the love of money (and the desires it feeds) as a driving factor for our economy. What has this produced though?  
  
- Poverty  
- Starvation  
- Murder  
- Abuse/Wide-Scale Violence  
- Class Division  
- Racism  
- Sex-ism  
- Child Prostitution  
- Slavery  
  
The list can go on, I assure you. What have you claimed Communism has produced? Laziness. I will gladly take this character flaw over the atrocities mentioned above.  
  
Communism for our Future!

Pure socialism: Pure Socialism involves a centrally planned economic system, which requires a government controlled population of workers to operate the system. Therefore Socialism is both an economic system and a government system.... Essential elements of pure socialism: 1. production targets for different segments of the economy, 2. rationing of certain commodities to determine demand for them, 3. price and wage fixing by the state, and 4. a conscripted labor market in which workers are assigned jobs by the state. Source: <URL>... I contend that the system outlined above would be impossible to achieve in practice and would not be beneficial for a country such as the USA. I believe it can be taken as common knowledge that the USA is currently one of the better-off counties in the world. It has a high GDP, a very strong military and a relatively high standard of living. I will provide specific evidence for this in my next post, if challenged to do so. Under pure socialism, the concept of free-economy is virtually non-existent. The government sets all prices, the government sets all wages, the government decides on the jobs that workers will be performing. Therefore, there is little to none incentive for a person to be more productive or to strive for excellence. In a pure socialist state people do not start their own business. Competition has no effect as prices are set by the government and are presumably equal across each industry. This would destroy the incentive to improve services provided to the customer. ""The customer is always right"" would cease to exist. Who would pay the price for this? The consumer. This would of course also affect export, as the quality of American goods and services would suffer. Since the government decides who will perform which job, people will be inherently unhappy as they will not have the luxury of choosing their desired career path. The very concept of socialism relies on the principle that everyone is equal. This in itself is a myth. People are not equal. That may be sad but it's true. Some are smarter than others. Some are stronger than others. Some are more prone to diseases. Some are born disabled. Some are considered more sexually appealing than others. Some are more friendly than others. Some are susceptible to addictions more than others. The very concept of attempting to equalise people is flawed. It is also inefficient. It will arugably deprive the community of economic ""natural selection"" where those with the highest capacity and a proven record are given the most responsible positions. One could argue that the government could take care of that. However, just how humongous would a beaurocratic machine have to be for it to be able to conduct such a massive task? It would be huge and inefficient. Government officials would be extremely prone to corruption, bribery would be rife. While government-subsidised health care is a great concept, a pure socialist system goes way beyond this. Health-care professionals who are limited by equalised, government-set wages will not seek to excel as there is simply no incentive. There is no prospect of finding a better paid job in a better health care facility. Many will simply flee the country and look for work abroad, where they feel more free and appreciated. Again, the government might be able to allow higher wages to better-performing health-care centres. And again, this would require a huge government machine, again prone to corruption and bribery. Education is perhaps the weakest point in my argument. Educators around the world are notoriously underpaid in any economic system and arguably the educational systems of existing socialist countries do rival those of capitalist nations. But what will happen with those who have attained that education? Will they stick around and work in a government-owned organisation and get paid their government-set wages? Or will they flee the USA and look for work somewhere where competition amongst employers gives rise to more attractive job offers? I believe the answer to this question is quite obvious. All this would result in an inefficient economy and a very unhappy society. This is so in particular for a country like the United States where people value their freedoms so highly, where people consider themselves something of a world-model for freedom, individualism and justice. I am not suggesting that this image is in fact correct. Nor am I suggesting that it is not. However, I do contend that these concepts are so enshrined in the American psyche that the people of the USA would never be happy in a system where they are told to all be equal, where they are deprived of their individualism, where they are deprived of any incentive to excel, where they are deprived of the right to start an enterprise, to reap the benefits of their own ideas. Given that my opponent has already forfeited a round and has given no sign of life, I will stop here. In light of all the above factors (and there are more, many more) I conclude that pure socialism could never work a country like the United States of America, if indeed it could work anywhere. I might qualify this statement by saying that in a perfect society with perfect people (who indeed are all equal in every aspect) a system of this type might in fact work.

It sets man apart from the animal world, fits him for the dominion God intended him to have over the earth (Genesis 1:28), and enables him to commune with his Maker. It is a likeness mentally, morally, and socially. Mentally, man was created as a rational, volitional agent. In other words, man can reason and man can choose. This is a reflection of God's intellect and freedom. Anytime someone invents a machine, writes a book, paints a landscape, enjoys a symphony, calculates a sum, or names a pet, he or she is proclaiming the fact that we are made in God's image. Morally, man was created in righteousness and perfect innocence, a reflection of God's holiness. God saw all He had made (mankind included) and called it ""very good"" (Genesis 1:31). Our conscience or ""moral compass"" is a vestige of that original state. Whenever someone writes a law, recoils from evil, praises good behavior, or feels guilty, he is confirming the fact that we are made in God's own image. Socially, man was created for fellowship. This reflects God's triune nature and His love. In Eden, man's primary relationship was with God (Genesis 3:8 implies fellowship with God), and God made the first woman because ""it is not good for the man to be alone"" (Genesis 2:18). Every time someone marries, makes a friend, hugs a child, or attends church, he is demonstrating the fact that we are made in the likeness of God. Part of being made in God's image is that Adam had the capacity to make free choices. Although he was given a righteous nature, Adam made an evil choice to rebel against his Creator. In so doing, Adam marred the image of God within himself, and he passed that damaged likeness on to all his descendants (Romans 5:12).

However, that is only because murder implies intent/motive and premeditation, where as God's armies followed blindly and killed for no other reason than because they were told to. So God's followers were killers and God is the murderer. And who created war? Who created sin? Who created evil? GOD DID. God IS all knowing, he knew how the events of the world would unfold yet created it anyways. God cannot be just if he created evil. God cannot be good if he created evil. Thus, God contradicts himself and must, by every definition, be flawed. My opponent admits that war=/=murder. What is murder?

We call the absence of dirt a hole, but it cannot be separated from the dirt. So when God created, it is true that all He created was good. One of the good things God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good. In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose. So, God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or reject good (evil).

397,"Marine_to_be: first off, congratulations on your decision to join the armed forces. I think that being a part of the military is an important and honorable career -- cheers! Now I will attempt to address each of your individual points mentioned in your argument. First, yes I do remember 9/11. But I don't remember Iraq being any more involved than the United States were. If I recall, it was members of the Taliban from Afghanistan that were responsible for the tragedy in my hometown of New York City -- not Iraq. In fact, Afghanistan (nor Muslims in general) was not responsible for what had happened. It was the result of one extreme religious group in particular - not every Muslim nation. Not every Iraqi is a terrorist; to think so is completely ignorant. So what exactly does 9/11 have to do with the war in Iraq? If you're claim is that the Iraqi regime has helped to fund terrorism, then obviously my rebuttal would be SO HAVE WE. It is common knowledge by now that the United States has helped supply Osama bin Laden himself with weapons, money and technology to help fight wars in the Middle East. So we are just as guilty ~ what's your point? You've mentioned that the media only portrays the bad things happening in Iraq and fails to show servicemen providing aid and supplies to the Iraqi people. My argument is that we don't need a war to provide relief to people in need. You concluded with the fact that your biggest gripe is not with people who disagree with the war specifically, but with people who do not support the troops. My statement back to you is that perhaps people DO in fact support the troops, and that's why they want them back home instead of off to die unnecessarily. People can support the fact that American soldiers are over in Iraq doing the job that their superiors have assigned unto them. However, supporting the troops while they do their best to survive their noble career is much different than agreeing that America should be involved in a war that is catastrophically expensive and detrimental to the economy, alienates our allies, and puts our soldiers at risk. Plus, how can you expect the American people to trust the government after we were lied to repeatedly about the imaginary WMDs? Bottom line: There are both pros and cons to the war in Iraq, but the cons far outweigh the good. And being against the war is completely different than being against the troops.",1,Danielle,"

I would like to correct my opponent by telling him that macro/micro evolution are not different theories but simply different parts of evolution. My opponent is of the stance that microevolution occurs, but macroevolution does not. The key difference between these is whether evolution can result in speciation. All speciation is is when mutations cause one breed to no longer reproduce with another, making them separate species. *No Sir, I am correcting YOU. Piggy-backing a lie (macro evolution) onto a truth (micro evolution) and then calling it one theory will not hold water without an example... I will provide a known example of speciation, but I would first like to point out the obvious logical flaw with suggesting that no species can split into 2 different species. This would be suggesting that the different species in the world are not genetically related whatsoever. *You have NOT provided a known example! Similarities between species suggest a common designer NOT common ancestry.. Ford automobiles all look kind of similar.. same designer! This is quite ridiculous, of course, considering how similar many different species are. For instance, chimpanzees and humans (which aren't even in the same genus) only have a 1.2% difference in genes. My opponent seems to be suggesting that this almost identical genome is the result of pure coincidence? That is ridiculous, logically that information would imply that humans and chimpanzees have a common ancestor, and that somewhere along the way, their lineages were divided into 2 different species. *See above answer! My opponent seems to have another misconception about evolution which I would like to point out. He defined macroevolution as suggesting ""that species may change from one species to another species"". That is not a description of evolution.

And likewise, in the instance of microevolution, the whole species does not necessarily change, but certain individuals may be present that have a mutation that others don't. And if that lineage of slightly different individuals can get more and more variation, it is only logical that they, after a while, may not be able to reproduce with others. This is especially true when a species is suddenly divided geographically and then undergo microevolution independently of each other. The chance that they would both happen to evolve exactly the same way if they are in different environments and divided so they can't reproduce, is negligible at best. Therefore, speciation definitely occurs in nature. *Example? Now, my opponent has also made the illogical statement that beneficial mutations never occur. This is a clear contradiction to his earlier statement that micro-evolution takes place. How can my opponent believe that microevolution takes place, yet not believe that beneficial mutations occur? The only answer I can think of is that he has some sort of misunderstanding of what evolution is or a misunderstanding of what mutations are. *Again, the misunderstanding is yours Sir. Because you start from the belief that everything is improving and becoming more complex etc then you naturally assume that mutation is beneficial. BUT everything is certainly not improving, everything is winding down, becoming weaker, smaller, more disease prone.

This mutation may help enhance the other senses but in NO way could it be described as beneficial to the species as a whole. There has been NO increase in genetic complexity. An increase in genetic complexity is absolutely CRUCIAL for macro evolution to occur. A species cannot ""adapt according to surroundings"" (which you have claimed occurs) if they cannot mutate beneficially. The ""adaptations"" are merely the mutations that were beneficial enough to not get the individual killed. Positive change cannot occur without beneficial mutations. So which is it? Microevolution or no good mutations? It can't be both. *Mutations DO get them killed! do you know HOW many species have become extinct?

Given that this debate is only 3 rounds and that my opponent has posted his opening arguments in round one (at least I think that's what that is o.O), I will go ahead of post my arguments. Arguments 1. Eggs =/= Fruit Fruit is defined as, "" a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower , mainly one or more ovaries ."" [1] Given that eggs have nothing to do with plants, Pro's resolution that eggs are fruits has already been defeated. 2. Eggs =/= Chicken Fruit Pro also calls eggs ""chicken fruit"". Whether this is meant to be part of his resolution or not, I'm not sure, but either way it is incorrect. To refute this claim, all one must do is compare the qualities of eggs with fruits and see if they match up. First thing, Pro refers to the yolk of an egg as the seed. This is incorrect. Yolks don't grow into anything, they simply feed the chicken embryo. If anything, the chicken embryo would be the seed as it grows into a chicken just as a seed grows into a tree. Even still, this is an unequal comparison. For starters, seeds don't out-grow the fruit as a chicken embryo does to an egg. In fact, in some cases the fruit's purpose is the exact opposite to that of the egg shell. The egg is meant to protect the chicken embryo from outside forces until such time that the chicken has grown enough to break out of the egg and start its life. The fruit, in the case of apples, cherries, blackberries, etc. is meant to incise animals so that they eat the fruit and therefore the seed along with it. This way, the seed passes through the animal's digestive system where it is eventually dispersed along with some much needed fertilizer. [2] In other words, the egg is meant to protect the chicken embryo from potential predators while the fruit is meant to get the seed eaten. 3. Dreams are Irrelevant Pro talks about a dream he had in which he planted an egg yolk and a tree grew. This is literally nonsense. Dreams are not bound by natural laws and therefore cannot be used as evidence of anything. Conclusion Factually speaking, eggs are not fruits. This is incontestable. However, even on a structural level fruits are not comparable to eggs a they differ so greatly in both process and purpose, sometimes to the point of having virtually opposite functions as I have shown.

409,"First I would like to thank my opponent for having such amazing conduct. Most people who know me on this site know that I use an I-phone and I-pod for most of these posts. Since I am not afforded the luxury of Microsoft when I am at work, it is an issue that I work with. I would like to point out the irony of you calling me out with grammar errors though when you seem prone to post sentence fragments. ""Cons most than pros unfortunately"". Even if I could guess what you were trying to say, it seems you forgot a subject and a verb. I do admit auto correct kills me, but at least I am witty enough to make a sentence look pretty. I will now break down my opponents main points again. (1) Drone strikes again, since he seems fixated on this. (2) Education (3) Healthcare (1) Since he mixes points on this first paragraph I will try to offer a rebuttal based off of what he was saying. He says ""Also, he cut health benefits for soldiers and makes them pay slightly more for medical service. Of course, this affects warfare which affects drone strikes."" Lets assume this is accurate for the sake of this debate. He is saying because Obama cut health benefits from soldiers, it will ultimately cause a drone strike. I am seriously hoping whoever is reading this can do basic math. Lets break this town. When you say because health care was cut(if this was true) from soldiers, we could logically assume it would affect a lot of different things. It would affect their families, it would affect the quality of work, it would affect their salaries. An argument like this could be considered a 1+1=2 argument. This is not the case though. He states because healthcare is supposedly cut from soldiers, It will somehow cause drone strikes. This is not a 1+1=2 argument it is a 1+1=3, actually its more like a 1+1=9. It is fine to play connect the dots, but you have to have all the dots in between. He merely says this, and offers a link showing how Pakistan responds to drone strikes. I will repeat what I said in my prior argument, it is impossible to debate this due to the type of information we would have to have. We would need to know the nature of why they are bombing certain groups of terrorists. I am actually quite happy they are bombing some of them, and I would imagine most people who do not want attacks to come on American soil are too. I think the most illogical part of his entire argument is this ""they happen in the Middle East and sometimes US citizens are put down by the government"". I think the stupidity of this statement speaks for itself. He is saying that our government is bombing terrorist while killing our citizens whom happen to be over there. Unless he is referring to us randomly bombing places, and accident killing reporters or missionaries, I have no idea how to even combat this golden piece of information. As i previously stated the absurdity of this remark is evident. (2) As for education I have shown links above to show what they are planning to do. Obama wants to make it easier for people with disabilities and that are poor to be able to go to college. I do not see why this is a problem. It is making people who can actually afford it pay to get in, and offered up pell grants and different types of loans to children who would not normally be able to afford it. The one thing I am sure that everybody knows is that it is an economic necessity for children to be able to educate themselves. He has not addressed this nor even bothered to bring it up or refute it. He merely states that they are cutting $89,000,000 dollars from education funding. I have always addressed this point in my previous argument so I will not both to repeat it again. (3) Again I have no idea how to even refute this. He merely blames Obama care for single handily causing our nations debt crisis. Once again the absurdity of this remark speaks for itself. We have been in an economic down turn long before Obama got into office. We have dubya to think for that. He also still has not addressed how Obama care would help people with pre exisitng medical conditions and terminal illness. I have shown above where they could not be turned down. He then proceeds to rant on about immigration and restates the point he made earlier without even addressing my rebuttal to it. In closing Con has not addressed 95 percent of the points I offered in rebuttals. He has not addressed any of my ideology stances in the first round. He has fought this whole entire debate with personal opinions hidden behind a wall of assumptions. I have shown you the ideology behind some of Obama's policies along with refuting all of pros claims, and have even explained the practicality of some of the current policies that are in place. While he has shown us his opinion, and provided some reasons to why he believes it, he has yet to combat any one of points that I provided. I think there is no question that Obama's policies have good ideology behind them as I have demonstrated all throughout this debate. I think we can even go as far as to say, that some of his policies that he has in place now have our best interest at heart. All throughout this debate I have shown that while they may not be perfect, the ideology behind his policies have the possibility to benefit our nation and some are doing just that. Con has not answered any of my questions so I think we can conclude that all of my points are valid and stand as is. Thank you for taking the time to read this debate.",1,Mikal,"

Also, I would like to demand my opponent to give further evidence about how children are being 'too restricted'(in her words), since what she has stated was just one example, and we cannot judge the status quo by just one example that the proposition experienced.

If children are being restricted, then why are there children doing drugs and drinking, and doing all kinds of things? Is this the result of the children becoming too restricted? The answer is definitely a NO. In the case of little children, I say that they are not being TOO restricted. As long as there are big safety risks, there are no limits to playing. Is that really being too restricted? Or is that just a small restriction to keep a parent's child from getting hurt?

Zoos take in animals whose habitats have been, or are being, destroyed, or that do not have enough food. Zoos help the animals by putting them in captivity, supplying them with food and a suitable habitat. Some zoos also take in animals who were orphaned as babies or were injured in an accident and can no longer fend for themsselves in the wild. Additional Info: The San Diego Zoo has a center that is devoted to the welfare of endangered or threatened animals. They have been working for over 30 years. This center is called ""CRES"" the Center for Research Endangered Species. It is the largest Zoo based center of it's kind. They are working world wide (20 other countries) to improve breeding and genetic pools for those species standing on the brink of extinction. This is a multidisciplinary research team, and some of their goals are to, combine field, and lab research/studies to improve long-term captive and wild populations. To maintain and share the genetic knowledge and resources to support conservation.

And again, the zoos provide another chance at life. While in rare cases the animals will attack, this is certainly not the norm. In the rare cases that this actually happens, the animal was usually either injured, or had a mental deficiency, and was in no way provoked by the zoo. --HIS THIRD POINT-- This is the same as his second contention, which I have already addressed.

424,"Since the resolution is a conjunct, I simply have to disprove either of the following two claims to ""win"" - as though there is a ""winner"" per se in this humorous debate... 1) Jesus is the spawn of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. 2) Jesus is a better deity than the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Far be it from me to demean His Noodlyness, I shall concede the second of these two points and simply state of His Noodlyness, ""May he reign forever, perched on His Holy Colander, justly Pastifying Christians and those Spagnostics."" Now... on to the contentions! 1) Both like alcoholic beverages. Jesus was a middle easterner, familiar with only wine from the middle east. Thus, any wine he created would need to taste like middle-eastern wine, else the entire personage at the banquet would be confused and suspicious. However, everyone knows perfectly well that the only wines that go well with pasta are from Italy. Any true son of the FSM would have made wine that went well with pasta. Furthermore, Jesus only serves wine in a couple of places in the gospels. Any true son of the FSM would have served wine every chance he could, exemplifying the most holy drunkenness of his divine father. Also, if Jesus were truly the son of the FSM, he would have rendered more of his parables as being about wine and pasta, rather than kings and servants. 2) Both Displayed Amazing Powers. Jesus never displayed the ability to fly while alive. However, the powers of the FSM greatly exceed the powers of Jesus. Jesus was man, and after a certain point would become so intoxicated as to pass out and be unable to exercise any of his powers. Any true son of the Most Holy Imbiber the FSM could drink as much alcohol as he wanted with no detriment to the exercise of his power. 3) Both Are Around Prostitutes. There is a fundamental difference between Jesus and the FSM on this regard. The FSM, a most holy deity, is capable of maintaining a ""noodly"" character in his ""appendage"" while amidst strippers and prostitutes. As we all know, no man would be able to do this, and Jesus was a man. Any true son of the FSM would be able to maintain a noodly appendage, and since Jesus was a man, he could not have done so. ********************************************** Additional arguments: 4. When Jesus supposedly multiplied food to feed 5000, he fed them bread and fish. Of course, any son of the Most Holy FSM would have fed the crowd Ramen. The cook time of the Ramen is of no importance, as any true son of the FSM could have simply ordered the Ramen to cook itself instantly - all forms of pasta necessarily obey the epitome of pastaness as well as his offspring. 5. I cannot, and will not believe that His Noodliness would dare splooge his Divine Alfredo Sauce from his no-longer-noodly appendage into something so comparatively lowly as a mere human female. The very thought is repugnant, violating every strand of his Noodly Gospel. 6. No mention of a ""Jesus"" being the son of His Noodliness is made in the Most Divine and Holy Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and this is not the sort of minor point that would have been merely left out, such as the type of beer to be served in heaven. 7. There is no evidence of this ""Jesus"" having anything resembling a noodly appendage. It is said that this ""Jesus"" was a man, but everyone knows that no man would describe himself as noodly. One may contend that he hid it to blend in with people, but everyone knows no true son of the FSM would dare disgrace his father by hiding his noodlyness from the world. ******************************************* A short refutation for FSM vs. Jesus as a deity even though I've conceded the point: All else being equal, the FSM can perform miracles and exercise his power with a .50 BAC. Jesus, on the other hand, would be so roaring drunk with a .15 BAC that he could not tell his left hand from his ""noodly appendage"" if you get my drift. Thus, the FSM is clearly the better deity, and since only the best deity should be in charge, he is more legitimate at doing his job than Jesus. AFFIRMED. Ramen.",1,JustCallMeTarzan,"
  
Since the resolution is a conjunct, I simply have to disprove either of the following two claims to ""win"" - as though there is a ""winner"" per se in this humorous debate...  
  
1) Jesus is the spawn of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  
2) Jesus is a better deity than the Flying Spaghetti Monster.  
  
Far be it from me to demean His Noodlyness, I shall concede the second of these two points and simply state of His Noodlyness, ""May he reign forever, perched on His Holy Colander, justly Pastifying Christians and those Spagnostics.""  
  
Now... on to the contentions!  
  
1) Both like alcoholic beverages.  
  
Jesus was a middle easterner, familiar with only wine from the middle east. Thus, any wine he created would need to taste like middle-eastern wine, else the entire personage at the banquet would be confused and suspicious. However, everyone knows perfectly well that the only wines that go well with pasta are from Italy. Any true son of the FSM would have made wine that went well with pasta.  
  
Furthermore, Jesus only serves wine in a couple of places in the gospels. Any true son of the FSM would have served wine every chance he could, exemplifying the most holy drunkenness of his divine father. Also, if Jesus were truly the son of the FSM, he would have rendered more of his parables as being about wine and pasta, rather than kings and servants.  
  
2) Both Displayed Amazing Powers.  
  
Jesus never displayed the ability to fly while alive. However, the powers of the FSM greatly exceed the powers of Jesus. Jesus was man, and after a certain point would become so intoxicated as to pass out and be unable to exercise any of his powers. Any true son of the Most Holy Imbiber the FSM could drink as much alcohol as he wanted with no detriment to the exercise of his power.  
  
3) Both Are Around Prostitutes.  
  
There is a fundamental difference between Jesus and the FSM on this regard. The FSM, a most holy deity, is capable of maintaining a ""noodly"" character in his ""appendage"" while amidst strippers and prostitutes. As we all know, no man would be able to do this, and Jesus was a man. Any true son of the FSM would be able to maintain a noodly appendage, and since Jesus was a man, he could not have done so.  
  
**********************************************  
  
Additional arguments:  
  
4. When Jesus supposedly multiplied food to feed 5000, he fed them bread and fish. Of course, any son of the Most Holy FSM would have fed the crowd Ramen. The cook time of the Ramen is of no importance, as any true son of the FSM could have simply ordered the Ramen to cook itself instantly - all forms of pasta necessarily obey the epitome of pastaness as well as his offspring.  
  
5. I cannot, and will not believe that His Noodliness would dare splooge his Divine Alfredo Sauce from his no-longer-noodly appendage into something so comparatively lowly as a mere human female. The very thought is repugnant, violating every strand of his Noodly Gospel.  
  
6. No mention of a ""Jesus"" being the son of His Noodliness is made in the Most Divine and Holy Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and this is not the sort of minor point that would have been merely left out, such as the type of beer to be served in heaven.

One may contend that he hid it to blend in with people, but everyone knows no true son of the FSM would dare disgrace his father by hiding his noodlyness from the world.

428,"1A - If a company is inefficient, taxing them won't help them to increase efficiency. Efficiency in business increases profit margin, so an inefficient company will have a smaller profit margin. Adding tax to that reduced profit margin can damage or destroy a struggling balance sheet. 1B - If a company will only make $1 from an endeavor, then it isn't worth pursuing. Corporations have to turn profit, and can't waste time, money, and resources on large projects that result in little to no profit. 1C - If ALFA is purposefully creating food shortages, then a competitor will step in and undersell them. This is one of the strengths of a free market. A sole corporation can try to manipulate prices, but anybody can jump in and steal their base by selling cheaper. Pro's premise for the debate didn't focus on corporations not using land for price manipulation, but rather unused land in general. Even if one corporation was manipulating prices, a tax on unused land would hurt any corporation who couldn't currently operate at full capacity due to lack of capital or lack of demand. Taxes won't be used to reduce the deficit. All taxes except for income taxes are used for the areas in which they are taken. Gas taxes are used for transportation expenditures. Local taxes are used for police, fire fighters, and schools. Taxes on unused land would have to be used in the development of land in some way. Pro's idea of using taxes on idle land to reduce taxes on farms is counter-intuitive. Taxing someone who isn't making money, to reduce the taxes of someone who is making money doesn't do any good for those who aren't making money. It would be the same as increasing taxes on the bottom 50% of Americans in order to reduce taxes on the top 1% of Americans. Further, Pro states that corporations who 'refuse' to use their lands will be the only ones taxed more. In any economy, corporations will try to get the best profit that they can. If a corporation isn't running at full capacity, it is either due to lack of capital, or lack of demand. Adding tax will not increase demand. 2 - The demand is for newer construction, not just newer appliances. Renters and buyers know that a new building will have less upkeep than an old building on average. The reason the developer made the new complex is because there is a demand for it. The existing complex would need renovation and perhaps price reduction to try and compete with that same demographic. Anyway, in a free market, the government can't force a company to increase or decrease their prices. Otherwise, the free market is lost, and that is not what we have built America upon. 2B - Taxing those who are running under full capacity(which means they aren't making as much money as they could) will not help the economy, and Pro hasn't stated any arguments as to why these taxes would help. More likely, corporations and complex management companies would go under financially due to having an added financial burden. Pro doesn't acknowledge the possibility that the complex management *can't* reduce prices. Perhaps if they did, they would be able to rent 100% but not be able to balance their sheet, causing them to go under more quickly. Pro wants to decide for businesses that they must lower prices if demand is low, but if demand is low, increased taxes will only hurt. 2C - New developers already have incentive to build the correct amount of apartments. They know that if they build too many they will lose money. They don't need a tax to teach them effective business practice. 3 - Pro is correct that the economy is better when land and buildings are utilized, but confuses cause and effect. When there is more demand in a market, more businesses are created and expand to meet that demand. When there is more demand for houses, developers build more houses to meet that demand. You can't stimulate demand by taxing land that isn't used. The land will only be used when the demand is there. In other words, supply is designed to match the demand. You can't increase demand by increasing supply. Pro hasn't stated a single example of how these taxes would stimulate demand in the economy. Without demand, the economy won't improve. Forcing people to pay more when there isn't enough demand, or sell their unused property when there isn't demand, is against the fundamentals of a free market and won't help in any way. As an example, if there is a corporation ACME that decides it wants to use ALFA's unused land for a new factory in which they will make a product that is in demand, they will approach ALFA and make an offer. If ALFA is losing money on the land due to lack of demand, they are likely to sell. This is how the market works. You can't force someone to sell unused land to someone else who needs it if the demand isn't already there.",1,TheTruthAnalyst,"

432,"Okay, so PRO ignores a whole chunk of refutation and chooses only to respond to those that she can. Many families would much prefer to have their own genetic children than adopt, although that is not deal, it is the truth, why would a couple choose not to have children if they really wanted them? If a disorder is gender specific this would be a medical breakthrough for families with those fears. Don't you think, that if the families knew they had a genetic disease, they would much rather adopt? Yes I know what you are talking about, you're talking about how families would rather have children related to them. You can't compare these two families. The family you are talkign about has no genetic disorder. The family I am talking about has the gender genetic disorder. This family, would be much more likely to adopt because they would not want to put their child at risk. If they really wanted a child, they could adopt one. Furthermore, the genetic disorder cannot be guaranteed not to be to entirely absent from their child, even if it is not the gender specific for the disorder. As such, even with gender selection, the couple is taking a risk. As a couple who wants to have a healthy child, adoption would be a better solution. Is this necessarily a bad thing? We are living in an extremely over populated world, although it hasn't quite hit America yet as its such a vast landmass, countries such as Britain, France, Germany, India, China and Japan are vastly over populated, the human race has doubled in population since the 1800's and we have four times as many people as their were in the first century. Slowing down the worlds reproductive rate would in no way be a bad thing. In countries with no gender bias such as the USA the ratio of male:female babies would very likely stay the same. Yes, that is a bad thing. You're thinking only in the short term. Think about the long, long term. At first, yes, population levels will slowly decrease because of gender selection, there would not be enough couples to go around and reproduce. Now flash forward a few hundred years. The human population has now dimished to maybe a billion people, because there are not enough people to reproduce. Now, it poses a severe problem. Even if we wanted to reproduce and increase the population again, we can't, because of gender selection. IF we continuously cannot reproduce, the human population will eventually be endangered. This is not what we want to accomplish. Eventually, gender selection must be illegalized to save the human race and we would have accomplished nothing. It is better to illegalize it now. You are oblivious to the fact that this probelm will increase exponentially over time, as couples become more and more gender specific. This poses a huge problem to the human population. In developing countries contraception/birth control isn't readily available and as for families that are trying for children, why would they try to prevent conception? Sure, then they could go and have babies. I don't understand what you're trying to say. If you are trying for conception and do not care about the gender of your baby, you should not use birth control methods. If you truly want to have a child, you would not care about the gender, and would not use birth control. Thus, there would be no feeling of abandonment. Is abortion really a more moral than choosing the sex of the baby off the bat? Creating a life just to then destroy it, I am in no way 'anti-abortion' when it is necessary, but I think trying to have a baby and terminating it once you find out the sex is wrong. Also, ultrasounds often tell the sex of the baby around 20 weeks and in many countries the cut off date for an abortion is 12 weeks. So aborting it after determining the sex would be both morally and legally wrong. Thus gender selection eliminates both the need for an abortion as well as the moral and legal issues. You talk as if gender selection is moral. The main issue with abortion is that it causes harm to the baby. But how do you know that gender selection will not cause harm as well? Maybe it would cause a baby to be too masculine or feminine and you end up with homosexual babies. This could also create a feeling of dissappointment from parents and abandonment, that you claim to be so bad. Furthermore, in the future when gender selection is possible, maybe we'll have better methods of abortion. You never know. I hate to bring personal matters and experience into this debate but I know many women who have had miscarriages and tried for a baby a year or two later, my grandmother being one of them, so I know from personal experience that having the baby you once lost can help a lot of emotional pain. Cool, and I have a grandmother who had a miscarriage that did not not try for another baby ever. You also talked about filling the void. Why does the gender have to be the same? Again, if you truly wanted a child, you would not care about the gender of the child. This device only promotes the exploitation of children to achieve selfish means, such as the chinese mentality to carry on the family name with males. Therefore, this should not be legalized.",1,Hardcore.Pwnography,"
  
  Okay, so PRO ignores a whole chunk of refutation and chooses only to respond to those that she can.  Many families would much prefer to have their own genetic children than adopt, although that is not deal, it is the truth, why would a couple choose not to have children if they really wanted them? If a disorder is gender specific this would be a medical breakthrough for families with those fears.  Don't you think, that if the families knew they had a genetic disease, they would much rather adopt? Yes I know what you are talking about, you're talking about how families would rather have children related to them. You can't compare these two families. The family you are talkign about has no genetic disorder. The family I am talking about has the gender genetic disorder. This family, would be much more likely to adopt because they would not want to put their child at risk. If they really wanted a child, they could adopt one. Furthermore, the genetic disorder cannot be guaranteed not to be to entirely absent from their child, even if it is not the gender specific for the disorder. As such, even with gender selection, the couple is taking a risk. As a couple who wants to have a healthy child, adoption would be a better solution.  Is this necessarily a bad thing? We are living in an extremely over populated world, although it hasn't quite hit America yet as its such a vast landmass, countries such as Britain, France, Germany, India, China and Japan are vastly over populated, the human race has doubled in population since the 1800's and we have four times as many people as their were in the first century. Slowing down the worlds reproductive rate would in no way be a bad thing. In countries with no gender bias such as the USA the ratio of male:female babies would very likely stay the same.    Yes, that is a bad thing. You're thinking only in the short term. Think about the long, long term.  At first, yes, population levels will slowly decrease because of gender selection, there would not be enough couples to go around and reproduce. Now flash forward a few hundred years.  The human population has now dimished to maybe a billion people, because there are not enough people to reproduce. Now, it poses a severe problem. Even if we wanted to reproduce and increase the population again, we can't, because of gender selection. IF we continuously cannot reproduce, the human population will eventually be endangered. This is not what we want to accomplish. Eventually, gender selection must be illegalized to save the human race and we would have accomplished nothing. It is better to illegalize it now.

436,"Thanks to my opponent for instigating this debate. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve some of the main issues that got somewhat obscured in the previous debate we did on gay marriage. Our goal in this debate is to decide whether marriage should exist as a legal institution, not to argue over the legal merits of specific types of marriages. ::Case Pro- Rebuttals:: Contention 1: The legalization of marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Mongeese rightfully observes that our legal system is set up in such a way so that single people are treated differently than married people. However, the conclusions he draws from this fact seem wholly unsubstantiated. Married people have reached a status in society that justifies their special treatment. They simply have many more responsibilities than most single people. Given this fact, it is unreasonable and legally preposterous to argue that treating married and non-married people differently violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. One of my main purposes in this debate will be to show that a legal distinction between married and non-married people is justifiable. ::Case Pro:: Contention 1: Discrimination between married and single people is justified. The dichotomy of legal treatment between those who are married and those who aren't is warranted. Married people take on extra responsibilities that are not undertaken by single people. For instance, they often raise families, which requires quite a bit of time, effort, and money. People that get married have lots of responsibilities, and thus, it is not unreasonable that they should be rewarded for this in a way that single people aren't. Furthermore, if single people want to receive the benefits that married people receive all they have to do is get married. Marriage itself is not an inherently segregated or discriminatory institution. Anyone can get married whether they are rich or poor; educated or uneducated; white or black; or completely incompetent. There is nothing stopping people from getting married. Every legal resident of the United States, except gays, is on a level playing field in terms of their ability to be married. Therefore, single people do little more than gripe when they argue that married people receive legal benefits that they don't. Contention 2: Legally sanctioned marriages are good for couples. As the DDO member andre points out in one of his debates, marriage has many useful functions that are intrinsically valuable to a couple. [1] Among other things these benefits include: - Inheritance of property - Rights to make a medical decision for a spouse, or making other decision such as funeral arrangements - Joint tax filing and joint adoption - Rights to non-resident or alien partners - Marital confidence privilege and spousal testimonial privilege - Parenting rights (access or rights of both partners to make decisions for their child) - Custody of children - Shared property and shared bank accounts It is, of course, true that these benefits could be achieved through various other methods without the legal sanctioning of marriage. However, what would be the point of reworking a system that doesn't appear to be broken? Legally sanctioned marriages provide all these benefits in one easy step. [2] If each of these rights had to be acquired individually or in groups the entire process of ""marriage"" would become needlessly convoluted. Contention 3: Marriage is good for society and should be promoted by the government. Marriage helps provide a safe place to have children and raise a family. And the importance of this institution really cannot be overrated. In fact, many aspects of societal dysfunction can be positively correlated with broken homes or otherwise dysfunctional families. [3] [4] Indeed, there is hardly another factor more foretelling of a persons status latter in life than the condition of the family they were raised in. Therefore, if a government wants to increase the well being of the nation that it's ruling it would be a good idea to promote marriage by subsidizing it with financial incentives and other benefits. This helps encourage couples to get married and in a small way helps improve marriages by making them financially less strenuous for people. Contention 4: Laws or legal arrangements that produce maximal utility should be preferred in a society. According to the philosopher Jeremy Bentham actions can be said to be good or bad depending on the consequences they produce. And among his many contributions to philosophy was his development of the hedonic calculus. [5] [6] To put this principle in simplistic terms it basically states that any action can be considered good depending on how much pleasure it produces when the well being of all of those affected is taken into consideration. Given this understanding of ethics, it is then easy to realize that legally sanctioned marriages are valuable because they produce many positive benefits in society for lots of people. Legally sanctioned marriages are key aspects of a healthy and functional society. Conversely, there is no reason to think that society would be any better off if my opponent's views were taken to their logical conclusion and we abolished marriage. Eradicating marriage as a legal institution would simply be a risky venture with no discernable benefits. And unless my opponent can demonstrate that abolishing marriage is good for society then he doesn't really have a very strong case. Hopefully, that should be enough for now.

I fail to see the logic that connects either of these assertions to what we have been arguing about. If I want my brother to handle my end of life issues then I can legally have that arranged without having to marry him. 4. All rights currently given by marriage should either not exist (should it be unwarranted benefits like tax cuts, that harm most of the people in having to pay extra taxes) or be allowed to everybody (should it be something to get by a zero-sum regulation placed by government in the first place, such as hospital visits or end-of-life issues). It would appear as if Mongeese can't see the contradictory nature of his own arguments. My opponent may think his proposal would lead to an egalitarian society.

In conclusion, when it comes to marriage:  
  
1. If government does not discriminate at all when it comes to who can be married, as my opponent proposes, then people will marry fifty other people just to take advantage of multiple tax breaks or other discriminatory benefits.

443,"I thank my opponent for an interesting opening round and hope to provide just as interesting arguments. But before I do so, I will attempt to refute his three arguments. The now factor Anatomy of the grammar behind the statement My opponent's first argument is basically that the very semantic structure of Pinnochio's statement would imply a lie. From the same source that Pro obtained his definition of 'now', one can find another alternate definition which fits more eloquenty into the sentence and which I believe more effectively demonstrates the purpose of the statement. The definition reads: In these present times; nowadays When Pinochio says the statement, ""My nose will now grow."", he is not describing an already existing fact. If he were, the grammatically correct statement would be ""My nose is(in the process of growing). There is an obvious difference between these two statements, one describing an action that is about to happen(such as when a magician claims that he will now saw a woman in half) and the other describing an action that is currently happening. Basic grammar and common sense dictates that Pinnochio when making the statement had the former meaning in mind. The truth factor The possibility of multipe growth qualifiers In this argument, my opponent brings up the possibility that Pinnochio's nose also grows when he is telling the truth. However, this possibility is actually demonstratably false. If we start from the premise that there are basically three types of statements as relating to this debate, then there is proof that Pinnochio's nose does not grow when he is telling the truth. The three statement types are truthhood, falsity, and a statement where the speaker is unsure about the truth/non-truth value or is not making a declarative statement. So, in order to diprove this argument, we need only find a declarative statement made by Pinnochio in which his nose does not grow. Refer to the 50 second mark of my video[1] in which Pinnochio answers Jiminy's question regarding whether he wanted to be a real boy. Pinnochio answers affirmatively that he does in fact wish to be a real boy. This obviously being a declarative statement, we can see that Pinnochio's nose in no way grows after he makes the statement, leading any rational observer to conclude that his nose at the very least does not grow when he is making a truthful statement. The omnipotent factor The source my opponent provided not working. Seeing as he provides no other substantial evidence for Pinnochio's alleged omnipotence other than the link, it is safe on my part to dismiss the argument as it holds no evidential or logical weight. At the most, the argument could only rise to the height of speculation since in order to prove his theory, my opponent would need to show with evidence why Pinnochio did not incorporate his omnipotence either to make himself a real boy in the first place, or how a puppet made out of cherry wood would come to possess such powers in the first place. Now on to my own positive arguments in favor of my case. Assumed falsity of Pinnochio's statement or the Argument from inability As anyone who has ever read 'The Adventures of Pinnochio' or seen the more popular Disney adaptation of the character to film, Pinnochio's personality is just like that of a small boy. Pinnochio is not very intelligent and his mind seems to function just as a prepubescent real boy would. As such, Pinnochio obviously does not or would not understand the logical and philosophical outcomes of such a statement. Why is this fact relevant? From the very fact that a lie(of which I have established is the only method of making his nose grow that can be evidentially backed up either from my opponent's framing of the character in R1 or from a plethora of video evidence. A lie is defined by Dictionary.com as: A false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive Seeing as Pinnochio has trouble tying his shoes, it does not seem like a stretch of the imagination that he would be unable to lie about the statement, just as it would be impossible for someone who had never heard of Lysander Spooner could not be held to be lying for saying that he did not have a beard. Pinnochio has no knowledge(that is ever shown) of even rudimentary skills in logic or philosophy. Seeing as lying is the purposeful intent to deceive and Pinnochio does not have the knowledge necessary to carry that out, his statement could not have been a lie. The resolution has been negated as I have shown that Pinnochio's nose would more than likely not grow in the event that he said ""My nose will now grow"".

I particularly commend him on this issue, as most students I know would never even imagine that un-knwon test dates are a good thing. They'd be considered ""unfair."" In the first round, I will not attempt to rebut my opponent's arguments, but rather set up the positive case for setting known test dates. 1. Students should know their expectations. I remember my first big surprise in my undergrad classes, when my professor highlighted all the information we needed to know throughout the semester for our exam. I asked him about this, because it didn't seem as though this was really challenging the class or getting us to learn. As an education professor, surely he knew better. He responded by explaining that the point of a test is to test what one knows, and the point of the teacher is to teach the relevant material. Now he didn't give us the exact questions or anything like that, but expectations were clear from the start. Failing to know what an assessment will cover and failing to know the time frame expectation for learning are not conducive to effective teaching or learning. 2. Exam structure makes the exam, not knowledge of the expectations. This point plays very well from my previous one. My opponent is under the impression that what constitutes true learning is absent in exams where the day is known. If the exam is pure multiple choice, based on a study guide of exact questions handed out to students, requiring solely rote memorization - I agree. But teachers don't have to make that low-level type of exam. I would argue that the type of exam that can be memorized so easily is actually void of significant meaning whether you know the test date or not. On Bloom's Taxonomy of learning [1], this has to rank pretty low. If, however, a teacher would give an essay exam that requires students to expound on themes discussed throughout the year, using terminology in the appropriate context, students could not simply ""Christmas tree"" their answers or rely on rote memorization. Regardless of how much you cram terms, a good exam will measure your understanding of them, not your memorization. If understanding is measured, knowing expectations (including the time of the exam) is a good thing. 3. Repetition and review are keys to learning [2]. I took Chemistry once in high school, and once in college. Both times I struggled with the concepts. This year, my school needed me to teach it. Surprisingly, it was pretty easy to pick up in a very short time. This is not only due to my growth, but due to the key of exposure. It is very well known in cognitive psychology that the amount of exposure to something increases one's ability to remember and grasp a concept. That is why students who study more frequently for shorter periods of time, as opposed to cramming, will actually have a more firm grasp and recollection of their work [3]. 4. Test anxiety is real [4]. While no exam method will completely annihilate test anxiety, an unknown exam date certainly exacerbates the problem. When goals and expectations are straightforward, students are able to feel more prepared and train better over time. Reducing worry is vital to ensuring that what is being measured is student understanding, not emotional variance. Summary: In summary, knowing specific goals is vital to appropriately teaching students. This does not preclude significant, higher level learning, as the learning does not come from being surprised, but rather from appropriate assessment. During the year and the final review session, teachers and students will have the opportunity to be exposed more frequently to information, as this is what will effect learning. Cramming would have no part in such a system, since it would prove to be a highly ineffective strategy. And as an added benefit to having a known test date, teachers will be supporting students who would otherwise show false performance results due to test anxiety. I look forward to hearing my opponent's rebuttals. This should prove to be a very interesting discussion. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>...",1,bjrscj,"

It is a profoundly unscientific approach to the origin and diversity of life and the available data and evidence fit much better with the theory of evolution than with creationism. In addition, creationism violates what's known as the establishment clause of the U.S. constitution. These are the three pillars of contention that I shall be building my case around. 1. Creationism isn't scientific 2. Evolution better explains the evidence 3. Creationism is unconstitutional Let's look at point one first of all. Creationism is unscientific for a variety of reasons, it's not falsifiable, it doesn't make any testable predictions, there is no evidence to support it and plenty of evidence against it, in addition to it blunting Occam's razor by grafting on the premise that life needs a designer when we have a perfectly suitable naturalistic explaination for the diversity and complexity of life in the form of evolution (more on that later). As a result, creationism has been widely rejected by the scientific community. A Gallup poll taken in 1991 showed that of the 480,000 scientists in the U.S., only 5% were creationists. That number however takes in to account engineers and scientists not working in fields relevant to the creation/evolution debate. When only taking in to account scientists working in relevant fields, that figure drop to less that 0.15%, and that's in America, the country with more so called ""creation scientists"" that anywhere else in the developed world. Creationism is unscientific simply because it does not follow the scientific method. A scientific theory begins with an observation, leads to a hypothesis to try and explain the observation, makes testable predictions, constantly compares those predictions against new evidence, then experiments are done to test it's veracity even further, experiments that must be reproducable and replicated to ensure that the theory really is the best, most complete explanation of the way a facet of the world works that we can offer, and when a better theory comes along, the original theory is either discarded or ammended.Creationism begins with the hypothesis and looks for observations to support it. Creationism offers no testable predictions or experiment by which we might test it. Creationism offers nothing that could falsify it, and now we most definitely have a better theory in evolution by natural selection, a theory that provides a powerful explanatory mechanism that creationism doesn't, it makes testable predictions, and the many observations and experiments supporting it are reproducable. Evolution is a scientific theory, creationism doesn't rise above the level of hypothesis at the very best, and pseudoscience at worst. So let's look at evolution. Evolution is one of the most watertight, widely supported, rigourous theories in science, standing proudly alongside relativity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. It's supported by molecular biology, it's supported by the fossil record, including transitional fossils that creationists endlessly claim don't exist, and it's independantly supported and verified by other fields of science, including medicine, many treatments of which, such as vaccines, have to take evolutionary principles in to account, in the case of flu vaccines, the disease that the vaccine has been designed to combat evolves, which is why new vaccines need to be brought out each year to combat the new strain. The level of support evolution enjoys from the scientific community is almost unanimus, many members of which, are Christians, or religious in general. I'll elaborate further on the evidence for evolution in my rebuttals as it will no doubt be challlenged (and rightly so, this is a debate after all) but for now I want to examine the legal argument. The establishment clause is a clause found in the first amendment of the U.S. constitution that states, verbatim: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"". This ensures that the United States cannot ratify a state church or state religion and ensures that religion and state are kept separate from each other, in other words, a religion, any religion, can't dictate the running of the state. Creationism is a religious viewpoint, even if you attempt to dress it up as merely a biological hypothesis, it's a hypothesis based solely on one's religious opinion, it has to be, because as I demonstrated earlier, the scientific method does not lead to the conclusion that there is a designer because such a theory is unscientific in a variety of ways. As further evidence of this, I call to your attention the very highly publicised legal trial of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area High School. This was a result of a recent decision of the school board voting to challenge evolution and ""teach the (so called) controversy"". The court found that intelligent design (which is just creationism in disguise, something else the court found) was a primarily religious initiative that unnecessarily and unconstitutionally entangled church and state, failing what has become known as the lemon test. It also found that intelligent design was not science. The lemon test examines three points. Is the action purely secular? Does it promote or inhibit religion? Does it entangle church and state? A failure of any of these conditions means the action is unconstitutional under the establishment clause. Intelligent design fails all three. So, with my opening statement, I will now turn the floor over to my opponent for his first rebuttal, and shall address his opening statement in my next round.",1,boss1592,"

461,"I'd like to thank my opponent for this challenge and look forward to a fun debate. [ Definitions ] I'll agree with my opponent's proposed definitions as well as provide some of my own. A) Standard: A rule or principle that is used for the basis of judgment B) Decent: Respectable; Worthy; Adequate Because both mine and my opponent's definitions are both correct and both feasible for discussion in terms of this debate, it would only be fair to accept BOTH of our proposed definitions. Let's begin. [ Rebuttal ] 1. Decency Con believes that I do not fit the description of ""decent"" because I do not conform to traditional standards of morality. First, let's observe that through my proposed definition, his reasoning (my support of gay marriage, for example) does not stand -- I can still be a respectable, worthy and adequate person despite my avocation for such issues. Moreover, I believe I can be considered a decent person even by my opponent's proposed definition. In order to do so, I must simply hold similar values to moral standards. However, morality cannot be measured simply by a majority opinion; it is fallacious to assume that the majority belief is always correct (moral) via the argumentum ad populum citation of faulty logic. You cannot conclude a proposition to be true because many or all people believe it. In other words, even if more people are opposed to gay marriage than are for it, it does not necessarily make that ideal the moral choice meaning I can still conform to moral standards without conforming to the majority opinion. Further proof of this issue is the very definition of 'standard' itself, which reads - a rule or principle that is used as the basis of judgment. Nowhere is the majority opinion considered an absolute standard for morality OR decency via my opponent's definition or my own. 2. Good Head :P Con begins by noting that what's ""good"" is subjective. Therefore, even if we were to ignorantly assume that the head displayed in my profile picture was my own, clearly you cannot prove that a ""warpy"" head is not a good head. First of all, it is a drawing - not a photo - meaning that whether the head was warpy or not has no bearing on the actual head's (the basis for the drawing) function... which, by the way, is Johnny Depp's. Second, the warped head may be a visual distortion of the artist or even you - the viewer - which again says nothing about the character's head. Finally, Con cannot prove that the displayed head is my own, OR that my actual head is ""warpy."" This point is null and void. 3. Head and Shoulders My opponent proposes that my head is not indeed on my shoulders; it is on my neck. Let's begin by noting that my opponent cannot actually prove that my head is on my neck, as there are people who suffer from a condition where what is supposed to be their neck bone is actually fused with their shoulders, thus not allowing them to turn their head. Since a neck is merely defined as narrowed region of the body connecting the head to the trunk by encyclopedia.com, this may very well be the case for me. However, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that I do indeed have a working neck (though my opponent nor myself cannot prove it to be so). That said, simply because my head is on my neck does not mean that my head is not on my shoulders. Let's use my opponent's example and usage of the word 'On' from his proposed definition. He uses the example of a book lying ON the table. However, what if there were a table cloth on that table? The book would then actually be ON the table cloth. Moreover, the book would still be ON the table. We can apply this analogy to my head. My head is both on my neck and my shoulders; the neck merely connects the two. Thus if your parent were to say, ""My job puts food on the table,"" they may literally mean ""My job puts food on the plate on the table."" Still, the first claim that food is on the table is still correct. Likewise, my head may very well be on my neck, but it is still on my shoulders via the connection. Back to Con.",1,Danielle,"

I'll agree with my opponent's proposed definitions as well as provide some of my own.  
  
A) Standard: A rule or principle that is used for the basis of judgment  
B) Decent: Respectable; Worthy; Adequate  
  
Because both mine and my opponent's definitions are both correct and both feasible for discussion in terms of this debate, it would only be fair to accept BOTH of our proposed definitions. Let's begin.  
  
[ Rebuttal ]  
  
1. Decency  
  
Con believes that I do not fit the description of ""decent"" because I do not conform to traditional standards of morality. First, let's observe that through my proposed definition, his reasoning (my support of gay marriage, for example) does not stand -- I can still be a respectable, worthy and adequate person despite my avocation for such issues.  
  
Moreover, I believe I can be considered a decent person even by my opponent's proposed definition. In order to do so, I must simply hold similar values to moral standards. However, morality cannot be measured simply by a majority opinion; it is fallacious to assume that the majority belief is always correct (moral) via the argumentum ad populum citation of faulty logic. You cannot conclude a proposition to be true because many or all people believe it. In other words, even if more people are opposed to gay marriage than are for it, it does not necessarily make that ideal the moral choice meaning I can still conform to moral standards without conforming to the majority opinion. Further proof of this issue is the very definition of 'standard' itself, which reads - a rule or principle that is used as the basis of judgment. Nowhere is the majority opinion considered an absolute standard for morality OR decency via my opponent's definition or my own.  
  
2. Good Head :P  
  
Con begins by noting that what's ""good"" is subjective. Therefore, even if we were to ignorantly assume that the head displayed in my profile picture was my own, clearly you cannot prove that a ""warpy"" head is not a good head. First of all, it is a drawing - not a photo - meaning that whether the head was warpy or not has no bearing on the actual head's (the basis for the drawing) function... which, by the way, is Johnny Depp's. Second, the warped head may be a visual distortion of the artist or even you - the viewer - which again says nothing about the character's head. Finally, Con cannot prove that the displayed head is my own, OR that my actual head is ""warpy."" This point is null and void.  
  
3. Head and Shoulders  
  
My opponent proposes that my head is not indeed on my shoulders; it is on my neck. Let's begin by noting that my opponent cannot actually prove that my head is on my neck, as there are people who suffer from a condition where what is supposed to be their neck bone is actually fused with their shoulders, thus not allowing them to turn their head. Since a neck is merely defined as narrowed region of the body connecting the head to the trunk by encyclopedia.com, this may very well be the case for me.  
  
However, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that I do indeed have a working neck (though my opponent nor myself cannot prove it to be so). That said, simply because my head is on my neck does not mean that my head is not on my shoulders. Let's use my opponent's example and usage of the word 'On' from his proposed definition. He uses the example of a book lying ON the table. However, what if there were a table cloth on that table? The book would then actually be ON the table cloth. Moreover, the book would still be ON the table.  
  
We can apply this analogy to my head. My head is both on my neck and my shoulders; the neck merely connects the two. Thus if your parent were to say, ""My job puts food on the table,"" they may literally mean ""My job puts food on the plate on the table."" Still, the first claim that food is on the table is still correct. Likewise, my head may very well be on my neck, but it is still on my shoulders via the connection.

So such players as Barry Bonds, all-time MLB home leader, Roger Clemens, 7 time Cy Young Award winner and 11 time All-Star, Curt Schilling, 19 year veteran pitcher and 3 time World Series champion, Manny Ramirez, 12 time All-Star and 9 time Silver Slugger Award winner, and Mark McGwire, 12 time All-Star and 2 time World Series champion should be not allowed in the Hall of Fame? I say put the drugs aside and look at what they accomplished in their lives. This includes Alex Rodriguez. So I say Alex Rodriguez was a great player especially for his age. He is a role model to many children in Little League and around the country. His number definitely show his qualification to be in the Hall of Fame.",Sports,1,Alex-Rodriguez-in-the-Hall-of-Fame/1/,2508
475,"I regretfully point out that my opponent's last post was nothing but accusations and poor sportsmanship. First, my opponent makes a brazen statement where he accuses me of saying something that I absolutely did not say. This is an obvious strawman fallacy since he then goes on to make an irrelevant argument against my alleged statement. Please do not listen to his lies, I never made any statement saying that DNA is a ""random, good-for-nothing pattern"", this is a figment of his imagination. My opponent claims that since DNA contains information, then DNA is a code. This is untrue as *everything* contains information. This is the essential flaw in his argument. My opponent assumes that the information we see in DNA is the same type of information from a computer chip or a website. What he does not understand is that although we can interpret DNA as a type of information, it actually is not, because it does not involve mental interpretation, but pure physical reaction. This is what makes it differ from all other types of information and why we cannot consider DNA to be a true code and a code developed by intelligence, but rather, a genetic code. My opponent cannot resolve this issue and has not resolved this issue. My opponent then goes on to make an argument that assumes that I conceded that patterns are the same as codes. I have made no such concession and will not. Codes involve mental interpretation, patterns are observed order, DNA is just a physical substance that humans can use as a code, but it is not naturally a code. My opponent then argues by design, using many design arguments that are highly illogical and fallacious. He has already proposed that we discuss it outside this debate, so I shall ignore all his arguments by design and simply tell him and the audience that I have answers to every single one of his arguments regarding Intelligent Design and hope to debate him on it afterwards. My opponent claims that since life comes from DNA, then it must be a code. Life comes from amino acids, from atoms, from molecules, these things are not codes either, they are physical occurrences just like DNA. The way that DNA builds life is not coding, but pure and undirected physical reaction. My opponent makes another claim that since we see DNA as a code, then it is a code. I have addressed this. Through the eyes of a layman, a simple-minded and non-scientific person, or one who is only superficial in knowledge, DNA will be a code. However, close examination and understanding shows how our own flaws in knowledge and understanding form this incorrect notion. Finally, my opponent argues that if DNA is not a code, then it should not be unique. First of all, this is a non sequitor. Something that is a code need not be unique and things that are not codes are not always commonplace. Second of all, DNA is not unique, RNA exists via a slightly different mechanism but almost the same. Third, my opponent does not understand evolution if he does not know why DNA seems to be the most prominent. It is because DNA out-competed others, as was shown in the video that my opponent obviously did not read. This is why there is 1 species of human as opposed to 500 similar species of human and why there is 1 dominant form of genetic code as opposed to 500. In conclusion: My opponent can offer absolutely no arguments. I have set forth a variety of rebuttals for the logical fallacy of his argument and he has not directly addressed even one of them, only go in a roundabout fashion to make different arguments. Whereas mine were direct disproofs, my opponent simply made arguments for his case that of themselves were logically fallacious or rebutted above. Please do not be fooled by my opponent's inclusion of design argument because design argument is inherently filled with logical flaws. Since he has not proven Intelligent Design, it cannot be admitted as evidence. WHY MY OPPONENT'S ARGUMENT FAILS: A more complicated summary is simply that this argument is based on semantics. We see DNA superficially as a code because with DNA, we as humans can do several things with it, such as draw information from it. Since we can do X,Y,Z with DNA and X,Y,Z with other codes, we designate DNA as a code in that particular way. I can drink from a bowl and I can drink from a cup, but that does not make a bowl a cup. There are intrinsic differences between a bowl and a cup and there are intrinsic differences between DNA and normal codes. These differences were clearly illustrated and unrefuted. All codes involve human interpretation of information to be of use. DNA requires only physics. Bacterial flagella are not machines, packs of dogs are not societies, DNA is not a code. Since CON has offered no substantial counterpoint while I have offered many refutations that still stand, and since CON should not make new arguments in the last round, I urge a PRO vote.

482,"My dear laissez-faire friend. You failed to refute any of my arguments and thus, I will post them again. Your only argument makes no sense. The government owns a significant portion of the economy in capitalist countries as well, that doesn't mean that everyone has the same salary... Again. I request that you refute my arguments. 1. The definition of communism: 'Any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods' [1] 2. Let me explain the natural progression of society, something that Marx called historical determinism. You see; society always moves in the way that is driven by social change and class struggle. Preceding communism is socialism, which is the system that you (although poorly) described above. Everything is put into the collective; however, your assertion that the people will abuse it is preposterous. All holdings are put into the collective on the part of the state, the state collectivizes all means of production, enabling for the workers to access it. This simply means that the workers would own the means of production through the state. This simply means that everyone would own everything together. Communism is a period that is enacted after socialism has done its job (collectivizing the means of production). Communism is the final period of social liberation, the final step of historical development. In communism, the state slowly withers away as class struggles are abolished. There has never been, and there never will be, a communist state, because communism entails the absence of a state as a repressive instrument of the bourgeois. A communist state cannot exist as that is in and of itself a contradiction. There can not be a period of communism so long as there is a state. 3. Now we come to the main argument that the right-wing laissez-faire capitalists like you tend to make: 'Everyone receives the same salary' This is absurd. Communism and socialism both entail that the means of production belong to society, not the wealthy bourgeois. Now, I agree, since private property is abolished so is the chance of making extraordinary amounts of wealth. But those amounts are not needed in communist society: in communist society, there is not currency. What you are referring to is socialism. The resolution is fallacious on its own.

That's it for the refutation, now let's get into why capitalism doesn't work and why socialism-communism is an ideal solution. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. The contradictions of exchange and use values. Commodities are produced for their use value and yet distributed for their exchange value. In other (simpler) words, you produce a loaf of bread for someone to buy it and then eat it. You produce it so someone will buy it and they buy it so they can eat it. 2. The law of value creates exploitation. As labour is not inherently worth anything on its own, it must go into the production of commodities, which are worthless without labour. Labour's worth adheres to the worth of commodities and vice versa. Human labour has no value on its own.",1,benko12345678,"
  
My dear laissez-faire friend. You failed to refute any of my arguments and thus, I will post them again. Your only argument makes no sense. The government owns a significant portion of the economy in capitalist countries as well, that doesn't mean that everyone has the same salary... Again. I request that you refute my arguments.  
  
1. The definition of communism: 'Any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods' [1]  
  
2. Let me explain the natural progression of society, something that Marx called historical determinism. You see; society always moves in the way that is driven by social change and class struggle. Preceding communism is socialism, which is the system that you (although poorly) described above. Everything is put into the collective; however, your assertion that the people will abuse it is preposterous. All holdings are put into the collective on the part of the state, the state collectivizes all means of production, enabling for the workers to access it. This simply means that the workers would own the means of production through the state. This simply means that everyone would own everything together. Communism is a period that is enacted after socialism has done its job (collectivizing the means of production). Communism is the final period of social liberation, the final step of historical development. In communism, the state slowly withers away as class struggles are abolished. There has never been, and there never will be, a communist state, because communism entails the absence of a state as a repressive instrument of the bourgeois. A communist state cannot exist as that is in and of itself a contradiction. There can not be a period of communism so long as there is a state.  
  
3. Now we come to the main argument that the right-wing laissez-faire capitalists like you tend to make: 'Everyone receives the same salary' This is absurd. Communism and socialism both entail that the means of production belong to society, not the wealthy bourgeois. Now, I agree, since private property is abolished so is the chance of making extraordinary amounts of wealth. But those amounts are not needed in communist society: in communist society, there is not currency. What you are referring to is socialism. The resolution is fallacious on its own.  
Doctors will still make more than sanitation workers; Why? Because they put more into the collective and they get more out of the collective. From each according to his ability to each according to his need, as Marx put it.

Remember, we are arguing about conformity not whether society has changed. Con associates modern times with non-conformity and the past with conformity. I disagree. The goalposts have simply shifted. Con rightly states ""today we have a different set of values"" and those values clearly still entail social constructs and norms. Con notes that we realize that discrimination is not acceptable, and in many groups today that holds true. Much of what was wrong in the past is considered acceptable today, and vice-versa. It works both ways, as I could just as easily evoke the idea that children should be able to get married or polygamy and get that same level of outcry today that was used in your example about gay marriage. In conclusion, Con's argument that today is somehow ""non-conformist"" seems arbitrary. We conform to our own standards. 2. Con speaks in very broad concepts here: ""[Today] people are developing their personalities...to be is who they actually are, not what they want to be."" I don't know what this means or to what extent this is different from the past. Certainly, mainstream society is more accepting of certain views than others, but there are still taboos. Is a racist more ""free"" to develop his personality today? How about a social conservative on a liberal college campus? Con is practicing a selective bias here. Con's argument is a little confusing here. He talks about how being an individual is ""trendy"" and that we follow this ""trend."" Is Con just substituting ""trends"" for ""conforming?"" It would seem so. I would really like Con to clarify this in the next round. Were people not individuals 40 years ago? How about 400? Which year did people start becoming individuals rather than brain dead conformists? Pro's Case: 1. Psychological experimentation has repeatedly confirmed the power of conformity. Two prominent experiments in this field have been the Asch and the Milgram experiment. Both experiments demonstrated the power that a group consensus or authority figure can hold over an individual. The Asch experiment, for example, asked groups questions about the lengths of lines and then asked for judgments to be made. The control group gave only one incorrect answer of 35, while the experimental (peer pressure) group led test subjects to answer over 1/3 of the questions incorrectly. Follow up experiments confirmed this effect, namely - that group pressure can largely sway individual judgment. The force was greatest when there was a large number of individuals that strongly voiced the incorrect opinion [1]. The Milgram experiment, similarly, showed how individuals were able to suppress their own moral judgments when faced with an authority figure. In this experiment, the ""teachers"" (test subjects) were instructed to shock ""learners"" (actually recordings, no one got hurt) as a method of teaching them word associations. When an incorrect answer was given, the learner received a shock administered by the teacher. The levels of shock were gradually increased, and the learners recordings were heard by the teacher so he could hear the pain that was inflicted. Shockingly, 65% of the participants reached the maximum voltage level of 450 volts after being coaxed by the scientist [2]. The learners stopped reacting after large bouts of screams indicating that they were unconscious if not dead. 2. Social norms exist, and there are consequences for violating them. Despite Con's attempt to frame the modern day as an era of individuality, there are still very basic social norms that govern human behavior. We operate inside a social network and implicitly abide by social norms that are realized at an early age. Remember, by saying ""slave"" we are claiming that these social norms exists and exert a clear, strong effect on the individual. The violation of some social norms leads to arrest - having sex with a minor, shoplifting, urinating on lawns - while others just entail social consequences. These social norms are inescapable and govern everyone's behavior, unless perhaps you live alone on top of a mountain. All members of society are binded by these norms. How about if I try to rebel? Lets say tomorrow I wake up and threw on some black clothing and eyeliner. Unfortunately, that look is already a little slice of society that has been claimed by the Goths, and in doing so I am conforming to their group standards. I could make the exact same point with hippies, punks, or jocks - name the high school stereotype. Now, if I really wanted to get creative I could go outside with only underwear on my head but this is too much of a violation of norms and I would be arrested. My refusal to conform would lead society to step in and directly stop my act. However, there is a middle ground between arrest and normality where social consequences occur that serve as an incentive or disincentive for individuals to follow a given social norm. In conclusion, these norms are an inescapable part of society that play a large role in governing our individual behavior. Additionally, it is much harder than one thinks to truly be a ""non-conformist"" given the multitude and diversity of groups that comprise a society, and the consequences for true violations of social norms are often direct and may even carry a sentence. The social norms that a society holds bind its members like a social glue in a clear and powerful sense, for better or for worse. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...",1,OMGJustinBieber,"

I'm going to be honest with you, dear voters, there is a fault in my character that I am deeply ashamed of - I'm selfish. Yes, I admit it, I don't give two tosses of monkey's tail about anybody else apart from myself. Now then, almost half of my annual salary goes to the Government and they spend it on my behalf, which I'm not entirely happy about.

Very few lotto winners donate most of their fortunes to good causes and the majority high-earners do all they can to avoid paying tax. That's why people are not allowed to invest their money as they see fit. For example, I might object to paying money to educate other people's children when I have no children of my own and decide that my taxes would be better spent on police marksmen to be take out those selfish motorists who hog the overtaking lanes on motorways (interstates). But then I would be forgetting that I was born into a desperately poor family and was educated at the taxpayer's expense and that one day I will be old and may need to rely on the state for my pension and health care needs and that an educated workforce will be required to pay for those requirements. The fact is, people in general are not in a position to decide what is best for them in the long term and that is why we elect politicians to make those decisions on our behalf.

505,"On round 1, Pro's first argument doesn't make any sense. She states that capitalism will end naturally by a Darwinist logic that she's a critic of. And guess what: history(not time) prove to us that communism failed. The communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union collapsed! China opened it's economy a little bit to capitalism and it's now much better than before. People are not starving to death in China as they did with Mao.(1) She also talks about how capitalist enterprises moved their factories from countries as the US and UK to the third world. She accuses them of doing this because workers finally got their right and they needed to transfer the factories to places where labour rights does not exist. Yes that is true, because American and European workers earned more money than in the nineteenth century and could afford better education for their children who did not want to work in a factory. If more people have a college degree why the hell they would want to work in a factory. So with less people applying for jobs in factories in the first world, the enterprises needed to get workers to produce somewhere else. They moved to country that still did not know industrial capitalism and that where still very in a rural economy. Millions of people now could leave their lives in the field to work in factories, which, by the way, PAY MORE! And let me remind her that Vietnam and China are great examples. They suffered a lot with famine with the strict socialist economic politics and capitalism took a lot of them away from poverty and starvation.(2) Yes there are fewer places where capitalism can go. But until there capitalism will give a way to maintain itself. Maybe humans won't be needed anymore in factories; machines would perform all the job. While capitalism gave us multiples technological innovation, I would like to ask Pro to give 1 technollogy invented in socialist countries that are used world wide? She also talks about war and ""capitalist funded wars"". What's that? Wars are wars and wars are bad. Actually, capitalism prevent wars. When two nations have a very developed capitalism it's very difficult to start a war. Big companies would lose a lot of money if a war started and this logic is only logical in capitalism. Any other socioeconomic system wars would be very difficult to prevent. I would also like the sources for her statement: "" Even in World War Two[...], only 15-20% of soldiers actually fired at the enemy"". She also talks about prejudices. This is interesting. She says prejudices like sexism racism and homophobia are "" deeply rooted in our economic system, in society and in culture"". Really? I'm a mulatto and never suffered racism. My mother is black and my dad is white. Where did she took this from. And I should remind her that prejudices are bad for capitalists. If they don't accept blacks, they will lose black costumers and other costumers offended by his racism. Capitalism makes people like each other, because if you don't you'll lose money. And on LGBT rights, let me remind you that Cuba(your beloved socialist country) sent gays to work camps against their will. What system is homophobic now?(3) And speaking on Cuba, let me remind that she is a communist hating capitalism on a capitalist country, while if I, a socialist hater, were in Cuba and shouted out loud ""I'm against socialism' I would probably be arrested if not killed by the government. Pro affirms she was happy in Cuba, but I think Cubans political prisoners will disagree.(4) sources: 1 <URL>... 2 <URL>... 3 <URL>... 4 <URL>...",1,JRRS,"

China opened it's economy a little bit to capitalism and it's now much better than before. People are not starving to death in China as they did with Mao.(1)  She also talks about how capitalist enterprises moved their factories from countries as the US and UK to the third world. She accuses them of doing this because workers finally got their right and they needed to transfer the factories to places where labour rights does not exist. Yes that is true, because American and European workers earned more money than in the nineteenth century and could afford better education for their children who did not want to work in a factory. If more people have a college degree why the hell they would want to work in a factory. So with less people applying for jobs in factories in the first world, the enterprises needed to get workers to produce somewhere else. They moved to country that still did not know industrial capitalism and that where still very in a rural economy. Millions of people now could leave their lives in the field to work in factories, which, by the way, PAY MORE! And let me remind her that Vietnam and China are great examples. They suffered a lot with famine with the strict socialist economic politics and capitalism took a lot of them away from poverty and starvation.(2)  Yes there are fewer places where capitalism can go. But until there capitalism will give a way to maintain itself. Maybe humans won't be needed anymore in factories; machines would perform all the job. While capitalism gave us multiples technological innovation, I would like to ask Pro to give 1 technollogy invented in socialist countries that are used world wide?  She also talks about war and ""capitalist funded wars"". What's that? Wars are wars and wars are bad. Actually, capitalism prevent wars. When two nations have a very developed capitalism it's very difficult to start a war. Big companies would lose a lot of money if a war started and this logic is only logical in capitalism. Any other socioeconomic system wars would be very difficult to prevent. I would also like the sources for her statement: ""  Even in   World War Two[...],   only 15-20% of soldiers actually fired at the enemy"".  She also talks about prejudices. This is interesting. She says prejudices like sexism racism and homophobia are "" deeply rooted in our economic system, in society and in culture"". Really? I'm a mulatto and never suffered racism. My mother is black and my dad is white. Where did she took this from. And I should remind her that prejudices are bad for capitalists. If they don't accept blacks, they will lose black costumers and other costumers offended by his racism. Capitalism makes people like each other, because if you don't you'll lose money. And on LGBT rights, let me remind you that Cuba(your beloved socialist country) sent gays to work camps against their will. What system is homophobic now?(3)  And speaking on Cuba, let me remind that she is a communist hating capitalism on a capitalist country, while if I, a socialist hater, were in Cuba and shouted out loud ""I'm against socialism' I would probably be arrested if not killed by the government. Pro affirms she was happy in Cuba, but I think Cubans political prisoners will disagree.(4)  sources:  1   http://en.wikipedia.org...  2   http://www.cup.edu.cn...  3  http://books.google.com.br...  4  http://www.amnesty.org...",Philosophy,2,Communism-Are-you-for-it/1/,7842

Saddam's link to al Qaeda? Oh that's right - they don't exist); the numerous accusations of conspiracy theories and scandal; his horrible decisions as president that have hurt the economy (he spent the surplus and bankrupted the treasury, not to mention he acquired the biggest annual deficit in history), gave the U.S. a bad reputation worldwide and went through with an illegal and unsupported war; dissolved treaties, unnecesarilly led us into a situation that has killed thousands and cost hundreds of billions; gone against fiscal conservative policies; his extremely low approval rating, not to mention having the record number of people protest his presidency; the fact that over 2 million Americans lost their jobs between 2000-2002 thanks to Bush and his policies, and on top of that he cut unemployment benefits for those workers; he presided over the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12 month period, and now wants to make tax payers bail out irresponsible home owners; Bush is presiding over the biggest energy crisis in history and not taking appropriate action against corruption; he also presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud of any market in any country in the history of the world, and refused to allow inspectors access to US prisoners of war and by default no longer abide by the Geneva Conventions...

526,"As a brief roadmap of my argument for this round, I will be proving that Socialism upholds the first three ideals of Democracy more effectively than Capitalism. I will also be providing a block against my opponent's first proposed point. Contention 1: The economic and social policies of Socialism allow the majority to rule rather than a wealthy minority. As my opponent earlier stated in his definitions, Socialism is distinct from capitalism because it provides equal benefits regardless of work completed. In a Socialist economy, no individual can rise significantly above another, while in a Capitalist system, both vertical and horizontal motion are possible in terms of socioeconomic status. In Capitalist systems, interest groups, often headed by the economic elite, often seek to shape public policy by ""donating"" or funding campaigns for office. In fact, the vast majority of elections are funded primarily by such interest groups. An overabundance of examples from American campaigns can be found at <URL>... . When these interest groups donate money and influence policy makers, they are not representing the majority of citizens. They are representing small groups of citizens, and the policies created often favor a wealthy minority over the majority population. Examples of this are abundant not only in the American government, but in capitalist or capitalist-leaning systems worldwide. A Socialist government, meanwhile, offers much less room for individuals to dominate the economy. Rather, in order to donate significant funds to political campaigns, a multitude of individuals would logically have to pool resources. Thus, any significant contributions by individuals to a political campaigns in a Socialist economic system would reflect a greater number of citizens, rather than a wealthy minority. In this case, majority does rule. Contention 2: The economic and social policies of Socialism protect and ensure minority rights more effectively than the economic and social policies of Capitalism. In many Democratic Capitalist nations, minorities are underrepresented in the Legislative branch of government. The Legislative branch is responsible for the creation and passing of new laws. When minorities are underrepresented in this governmental branch, policies that benefit and protect their rights are pursued less than necessary. For equality to exist in a Democracy, the rights and equality of minorities to the majority must be actively protected. The under representation of minorities in the Legislative branch, and therefore in government as a whole, is reflected by their economic and social conditions. For example, in America from the late twentieth century until now, the rate at which the number of impoverished African Americans is double that of the national rate of increase. The majority of Americans are caucasian, and thus the ""average rate"" primarily represents them. The rapidly rising number of impoverished African Americans effectively parallels their representation in congress; African Americans hold less than 10% of the seats in America's legislative branch. Perhaps one of the most significant recent examples of infringement on minority rights caused by the under representation of minorities in the Legislative branch is America's infamous Senate Bill 1070. A document originally proposed by Arizona and passed by the American senate, SB 1070 enabled police officers to pull over drivers and make ""reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of the person"" in the case of ""reasonable suspicion."" The law essentially legalized racial profiling for Arizona state police, infringing majorly on the rights of Latino Americans. Latino Americans are another minority group underrepresented in Congress. They, on average, also have a much lower per capita income than the American majority, and more often live in poverty. The relationship between these factors in undeniable. Argument Block: Equality is an inherent part of Democratic ideals. Equity does not suffice in a true Democracy. The use of equality in Democracy is parallel with the belief in Egalitarianism. Egalitarianism is the belief that all people ought to be treated equally in a society. Equity, meanwhile, would be referring to ""Equity theory,"" or the perceptions of fair or unfair distributions of resources within interpersonal relationships, which in this case are relationships among the citizens in a country. Equity theory would try to create as ""fair"" a distribution as possible. The idea is inherently flawed. While Egalitarianism is simple and absolute in concept, being the equal social and economic treatment of all by government, equity theory is debatable. The definition of equality is not subject to interpretation: it is the state of being equal. Fairness, meanwhile, is a very flexible term. Many people have different interpretations of what would be fair and what wouldn't. In the case of a ""Democracy"" based on equity alone (although such a thing would never be a true Democracy), one could take members of society who were more intelligent, more athletic, or more talented and treat these people at a different level than individuals who were less so. It could be considered ""fair"" to treat one who is ""better"" better. On the other hand, people with mental or physical disabilities should be treated differently, as well. It is only fair to the rest of society and to those people if the government spends less on them and cares less for them. The definition of equity and fairness is too broad and too malleable to be used in a Democracy. It can be easily warped to create a government under which not all citizens are represented, minority rights are not protected, and private interests dominate the political and social mechanisms of the country. I look forward to my opponent's arguments and rebuttals.",1,Public_Agenda,"

529,"Thank you, Nags, for accepting this debate. ""By the basic definition of IQ tests, they do in fact assess a person's intelligence, because IQ = intelligence quotient. And they do so in high/low measurements because tests measure knowledge on a scale, and scales are high and low."" I am not arguing about what the IQ tests claim that they can measure, but rather about their credibility regarding those measurements. To this I will bring my contentions. Contention 1: Someone who is credited as a genius can be a genius in a certain aspect, and yet be quite mediocre in other areas. <URL>... If that said genius were to take a typical IQ test, he would score highly in his strong area, yet fail in his weak area, thus bringing his score down and making him look average. Possible Situation: A prestigious engineering university who will look for logical students, will reject the 115 IQ student who is in fact a logical genius and yet has a very poor memory. Contention 2: The IQ test is, after all, a test that one has to sit down and do, and as I'm sure we all know, the performance during a test can be highly swayed by emotional and physical aspects. Examples: If a person's leg is giving him shooting pains, or that person has not slept well for a week or so, or if there is tremendous pressure on that person to do well on the test, he will be less likely to do as well as he would normally do. Human nature dictates that there is usually something bothering us. Contention 3: Much of the IQ test's testing tools, such as memory games, solving mathematical problems, etc. are areas that with practice one can improve. Thus I cannot see how performance in these areas can possibly prove anything other than how good that person is at that specific game, type of problem, etc. Someone can take an IQ test, score X, practice, go back and score higher than X. To conclude, little value can be attributed to the IQ test. While I concede that a hopelessly simple-minded person will score low, and an all-around genius will score high, an accurate evaluation of relative intelligence cannot possibly be determined.

531,"Here is my final argument. Thank you for this amazing debate! Rebuttal #1: Communism and Socialism are separate and incomparable. While Russia and China may qualify as being Socialist, their actions against minority groups and generally inhumane policies were not policies of Socialism; they were policies of Communism. Socialism is an economic and social system. Communism is Socialism, but with a fascist or police state dictatorship for a political system. It was the dictatorial political system that enacts policies these inhumane or unrepresentative policies, not the Socialist economic and social system. Rebuttal #2: Political and economic systems are separate and do not necessarily go hand in hand. I brought up the under representation of minorities not as a direct political effect or policy of Capitalism, but rather as an indirect effect caused by the economic policies of Capitalism, thus making it still legitimate in the context of the topic. Pure political policies are not legitimate for this topic. An economic system does need a political system to back it, yes, but the variance in political and economic systems is so massive that you can not necessarily say that all Bureaucracies are Capitalist, for example. The only exceptions would be Fascism and Communism, since both imply an economy owned and run by the government. However, no other political systems imply a particular economic system. A few examples . . . Capitalist Monarchies, Capitalist or Socialist Confederations, Capitalist Oligarchies, Capitalist and Socialist Republics . . . The list continues on, as shown by ( <URL>... ). Rebuttal #3: Socialism does give political bargaining power. A Democracy is meant to have majority rule. If minorities had the individual political bargaining power to make significant differences, majority rule would become void. Using my opponent's own analogy, blue collar workers do not have any connection or control to their bosses . . . In a Capitalist system. Under Socialism, where workers' rights and regulation are general policies, workers can strike or petition without fear and can influence their boss's decisions. Similarly, groups of citizens can come together to petition, or can withhold their vote. Thus, citizens still have political bargaining power, but it is vested in groups rather than individuals. Rebuttal #4: Socialism does not distribute wealth arbitrarily. Because wealth is distributed in regard to the current economic status of the nation in question, Socialism does not arbitrarily distribute wealth. Wealth is distributed equally and in regard to several factors, namely the government and economy. This is clearly not arbitrary. Rebuttal #5: Equality is necessary for Democracy, not equity. As I am short on space, I would like to remind my opponent that I proved that equality is an integral part of Democracy, and that equity does not suffice. To review my argument, please reread my argument block from Round 2. Contention #3: Socialism guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to citizens protected under a government more effectively than Capitalism. Life - When deprived of economic means by which to support himself, a citizen is being deprived of life. The greatest priority of a Democratic government is to ensure life to its citizens. In a Capitalist system where economy is driven by work done and is a competitive environment where not everyone is guaranteed a job, not everyone will have a means by which to support himself. If a citizen can not support himself, there must be a welfare program to ensure that he does not die of starvation or cold or some other similar harm. Any such welfare program would be social spending, an aspect of Socialism, not Capitalism. Liberty - Liberty is giving each and every citizen equal opportunity and treatment. In the case that one citizen can rise to a level of economic power and infringe upon the rights of another citizen, and do so legally at that, is a clear demonstration of how Capitalism fails to protect the Democratic right of a citizen to liberty. Socialism ensures the equal treatment of citizens and limits vertical socioeconomic movement, preventing such infringement upon the rights of others. The Pursuit of Happiness - How can a person pursue happiness if they cannot even afford to eat? Once again, one person taking from the economy for his own happiness but denying happiness to others is not Democracy. My opponent will probably argue that by limiting a person's ability to achieve wealth, you limit his or her ability to be happy. But this is not true. Numerous studies done by Princeton and Yale have found that once a person makes enough money to pay the bills, excess money does not make a person happier. In fact, suicide rates seem to increase with income. One such study can be found at ( <URL>... ). As this is the final round, I will conclude my arguments. Over the last few rounds, I have proven that the economic and social policies of Socialism more effectively uphold the five defined aspects of Democracy than the economic and social policies of Capitalism. They do this primarily through the regulation of economy, the equal treatment of citizens, the guarantee of life and safety through welfare programs, and preventing private interests from dominating government and politics. I have proven that equality is an integral aspect of Democracy, and that equity does not suffice. My opponent has provided rebuttals that rely on invalid comparisons and arguments that do not follow the topic. His counterarguments have not been sufficient, and thus I have carried my duty and satisfied the burden of proof. In conclusion, Socialism's economic and social policies do uphold the ideals of Democracy more effectively than Capitalism. Please give your vote",1,Public_Agenda,"

534,"My opponent makes an excellent point that the meaning of omnipotent has have different definitions and that these differences may cause the Paradox of the Stone to fail. However, his argument that the concept of omnipotent is limited to ""a deity that is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature"" is incorrect. ""When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ""I am God Almighty' "" as quoted from Genesis 17:1 and again in Genesis 35:11 ""And God said to him, ""I am God Almighty.' "" God does this in Exodus 6:3 ""I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty."" In each of these bible verses and in many others, God introduces himself as God the Almighty. Now, as my opponent has set forth the definition and meaning of almighty as ""includes having more power than any other thing."" This means that God himself is proclaiming that he has unrivaled or at least much more power than anything other thing. When this is the case, it seems to me that a truly Almighty God would have little trouble with a simple rock. However, even if you do not believe this concept, my opponent's concept is flawed as well. As evidenced in Genesis, the first book of the bible, the Christian God is a God of Creation. The Paradox of the Stone asks nothing that would go against the nature of God. In fact, it only asks that he do as he often does and create a stone. He is not being asked to sin or perform an action, which he has not done before. Therefore, my opponent's concept of what God is holds little if any value to this debate. Since, this paradox does nothing to force God against his nature and being that God introduces and proclaims himself as being almighty. With that in mind, my opponent has already agreed that something that is almighty has more power than anything else including a rock. Therefore, if the Christian God does not have all the power he claims to have, he is not the God portrayed by the Bible and Christian Faith and thusly this version of God cannot exist. My opponent also mentioned that if we assume that things that are logically impossible might be possible, then God is not disproved. However, by following this point of view logic and reasoning become pointless. By throwing out logic, we allow any random idea to make since. For example, if we dismiss logic then a person could easily say that because he or she gets up every morning to greet the sun, that his or her greeting causes the sun to rise and without that person getting up every morning the sun would never rise. This statement, seems to me at least, to be utterly ridiculous, however without logic a person could not tell the difference. Furthermore, since, debate is based on this same logic, by throwing the logic out we defeat the purpose of debate. That seems to me to be just as pointless as this idea would make logic. Lastly my opponent stated in his second to last paragraph that there is yet another way to show that we absolutely cannot assume ""omnipotent"" to mean the ability to do the logically impossible. However, my opponent fails to state what this way or method of reasoning is. He only proceeds to say what the impacts of making this assumption would be and how they are beneficial towards his side of the case. Therefore, I would like my opponent to at least state what this alternative way is. Otherwise, my opponent is just saying that there is another way, and expect everyone to blindly agree with him",1,KidateK,"
  
My opponent makes an excellent point that the meaning of omnipotent has have different definitions and that these differences may cause the Paradox of the Stone to fail. However, his argument that the concept of omnipotent is limited to ""a deity that is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature"" is incorrect. ""When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ""I am God Almighty' "" as quoted from Genesis 17:1 and again in Genesis 35:11 ""And God said to him, ""I am God Almighty.' "" God does this in Exodus 6:3 ""I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty."" In each of these bible verses and in many others, God introduces himself as God the Almighty. Now, as my opponent has set forth the definition and meaning of almighty as ""includes having more power than any other thing."" This means that God himself is proclaiming that he has unrivaled or at least much more power than anything other thing. When this is the case, it seems to me that a truly Almighty God would have little trouble with a simple rock.  
  
However, even if you do not believe this concept, my opponent's concept is flawed as well. As evidenced in Genesis, the first book of the bible, the Christian God is a God of Creation. The Paradox of the Stone asks nothing that would go against the nature of God. In fact, it only asks that he do as he often does and create a stone. He is not being asked to sin or perform an action, which he has not done before.  
  
Therefore, my opponent's concept of what God is holds little if any value to this debate. Since, this paradox does nothing to force God against his nature and being that God introduces and proclaims himself as being almighty. With that in mind, my opponent has already agreed that something that is almighty has more power than anything else including a rock. Therefore, if the Christian God does not have all the power he claims to have, he is not the God portrayed by the Bible and Christian Faith and thusly this version of God cannot exist.  
  
My opponent also mentioned that if we assume that things that are logically impossible might be possible, then God is not disproved. However, by following this point of view logic and reasoning become pointless. By throwing out logic, we allow any random idea to make since. For example, if we dismiss logic then a person could easily say that because he or she gets up every morning to greet the sun, that his or her greeting causes the sun to rise and without that person getting up every morning the sun would never rise. This statement, seems to me at least, to be utterly ridiculous, however without logic a person could not tell the difference. Furthermore, since, debate is based on this same logic, by throwing the logic out we defeat the purpose of debate. That seems to me to be just as pointless as this idea would make logic.  
  
Lastly my opponent stated in his second to last paragraph that there is yet another way to show that we absolutely cannot assume ""omnipotent"" to mean the ability to do the logically impossible. However, my opponent fails to state what this way or method of reasoning is. He only proceeds to say what the impacts of making this assumption would be and how they are beneficial towards his side of the case. Therefore, I would like my opponent to at least state what this alternative way is. Otherwise, my opponent is just saying that there is another way, and expect everyone to blindly agree with him",Religion,1,The-paradox-of-the-stone-successfully-disproves-the-Christian-God./1/,43699

543,"I gladly accept this challenge. Framework: In order to clarify the round, I will provide a few definitions. According to the New American Oxford Dictionary , fund is explained as to "" provide with money for a particular purpose "". Therefore, as defined as such, any arguments stemming from the methods that may or may not influence the American population are considered null and void and should not be considered in today's round. Furthermore, we define illegal as "" contrary to or forbidden by law, especially criminal law "". Therefore, we must not include substances including tobacco and alcohol in today's round as well. Secondarily, the general intent of a drug rehabilitation is to enable the patient to cease substance abuse, in order to avoid the psychological, legal, financial, social, and physical consequences that can be caused, especially by extreme abuse. Therefore, if the PRO can prove that the intent of the program has been fulfilled, then the PRO must win today's round. Contention 1: The intent of the program is justifiable as addiction and consumption has risen the past few years. An estimated 20.4 million people in the United States used some kind of illicit drug in the past 30 days, according to the latest government statistics. About 8.3 percent of all persons age 12 and over are involved in use of illegal drugs or the non-medical use of prescription drugs. T here are the most commonly abused drugs: Marijuana, by 14.8 million people, or 6 percent. Cocaine, 2.4 million users. Hallucinogens, including Ecstasy, 1 million users. Methamphetamine, about 731,000 users. Prescription drugs, 7 million non-medical users. The simple fact of the matter is that the problem of illicit drug addiction has gone up in recent years to a point where millions of Americans are under the influence daily. This is simply not something the United States government can ignore. Contention 2: Each user of an illicit drug is not always at fault. When we look at the causes for illicit drug usage, we see that it is not always the person's choice to do such. A recent study by the Drugs-Violence Task Force of the National Sentencing Commission explains, reasons range from ""to have a good time with my friends""--a social reason, as well as ""to get high."" However, those in the heavier user groups increasingly mention psychological coping as the underlying reasons for their use--""to get through the day,"" ""to relieve boredom,"" ""to deal with anger and frustration,"". With this, we see that these users of the illicit drugs are influenced by their peers, by psychological reasons, and by the accompanying stress that may appear in their lives. The following factors may even increase your likelihood of having a drug addiction: Family members who have struggled with addiction An abusive or neglectful childhood Mental health issues, including depression The use of drugs at a relatively young age All kinds of people can struggle with addiction regardless of whether or not these risk factors are prevalent in their lives. These illicit drugs act as an outlet for them, however our rehabilitation programs will prove to them that it is not an outlet. Contention 3: Rehabilitation programs ultimately work. Many people like to promote the myth that addictions can be overcome with willpower. Sadly, this is not true. When people use drugs, particularly over stretches of time, their brain changes in response to prolonged exposure to those drugs. Their cravings tend to get stronger, and they may feel compelled to use more of the drugs. This biological reality makes quitting alone very difficult. Thanks to drug addiction programs , there is no reason to go through the recovery process in a vacuum. These programs provide addicts with the support that they need to rehabilitate. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 23.5 million persons aged 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol abuse problem in 2009 (9.3 percent of persons aged 12 or older). Of these, only 2.6 million--11.2 percent of those who needed treatment--received it at a specialty facility. Most all of these patients were able to leave the facility cured. Contention 4: Rehabilitation programs are cost-effective. A new study of 1992 data estimates the economic costs to society of substance abuse at $246 billion for that year, and $276 billion projected for 1995. Alcohol-related lost productivity alone accounted for two-thirds of the total alcohol cost. Drug related crime accounted for over half of the total drug costs. Workplaces take the brunt in lost/poor performance, accidents, and crime. We are losing money from those who use illicit drugs. Decreasing the problem will aid in improving the economy and gaining more funds to actually counter the problem. Additionally, as I explain my framework, the government will not only rely on taxes to fund these programs but may reallocate in order to pay for this increasing problem. We need to do something before it is too late. Therefore, you need to vote for PRO in today's round. --- Thank you, ~ThyAnchor",1,Thyanchor,"

About 8.3 percent of all persons age 12 and over are involved in use of illegal drugs or the non-medical use of prescription drugs. T  here are the most commonly abused drugs:  
  
  Marijuana, by 14.8 million people, or 6 percent.  
  Cocaine, 2.4 million users.  
  Hallucinogens, including Ecstasy, 1 million users.  
  Methamphetamine, about 731,000 users.  
  Prescription drugs, 7 million non-medical users.  
  
  The simple fact of the matter is that the problem of illicit drug addiction has gone up in recent years to a point where millions of Americans are under the influence daily. This is simply not something the United States government can ignore.  Contention 2: Each user of an illicit drug is not always at fault.  When we look at the causes for illicit drug usage, we see that it is not always the person's choice to do such. A recent study by the Drugs-Violence Task Force of the National Sentencing Commission explains, reasons range from “to have a good time with my friends”—a social reason, as well as “to get high.” However, those in the heavier user groups increasingly mention psychological coping as the underlying reasons for their use—“to get through the day,” “to relieve boredom,” “to deal with anger and frustration,”. With this, we see that these users of the illicit drugs are influenced by their peers, by psychological reasons, and by the accompanying stress that may appear in their lives. The following factors may even increase your likelihood of having a drug addiction:
  
  Family members who have struggled with addiction  
  An abusive or neglectful childhood  
  Mental health issues, including depression  
  The use of drugs at a relatively young age  
  
  All kinds of people can struggle with addiction regardless of whether or not these risk factors are prevalent in their lives. These illicit drugs act as an outlet for them, however our rehabilitation programs will prove to them that it is not an outlet.  
  Contention 3: Rehabilitation programs ultimately work.  Many people like to promote the myth that addictions can be overcome with willpower. Sadly, this is not true. When people use drugs, particularly over stretches of time, their brain changes in response to prolonged exposure to those drugs. Their cravings tend to get stronger, and they may feel compelled to use more of the drugs. This biological reality makes quitting alone very difficult. Thanks to drug addiction programs  , there is no reason to go through the recovery process in a vacuum. These programs provide addicts with the support that they need to rehabilitate.   According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA’s) National Survey on Drug Use and Health,  23.5 million persons aged 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol abuse problem in 2009 (9.3 percent of persons aged 12 or older). Of these, only 2.6 million—11.2 percent of those who needed treatment—received it at a specialty facility. Most all of these patients were able to leave the facility cured.   Contention 4: Rehabilitation programs are cost-effective.  A new study of 1992 data estimates the economic costs to society of substance abuse at $246 billion for that year, and $276 billion projected for 1995. Alcohol-related lost productivity alone accounted for two-thirds of the total alcohol cost. Drug related crime accounted for over half of the total drug costs. Workplaces take the brunt in lost/poor performance, accidents, and crime. We are losing money from those who use illicit drugs. Decreasing the problem will aid in improving the economy and gaining more funds to actually counter the problem. Additionally, as I explain my framework, the government will not only rely on taxes to fund these programs but may reallocate in order to pay for this increasing problem.  We need to do something before it is too late.   Therefore, you need to vote for PRO in today's round.   ---  Thank you,  ~ThyAnchor ",Health,0,Should-the-U.-S.-Government-fund-rehabilitation-to-illegal-drug-abusers/1/,35533

Fathers are responsible for their children. I will not, however, accept responsibility for a child without also being afforded the same rights and privileges to the child as the mother. When a woman seeks an abortion she should be required to declare the identity of the father. His written authorization should be obtained before the procedure may be administered.

Process of a bill becoming a law I fail to see the weight in my opponent's argument concerning how a bill becomes a law. I am well aware of the process, but this fails to show for my opponent why gay marriage shouldn't be legalized. It basically amounts to that since gay marriage hasn't been made legal by the federal government, it shouldn't be legal. Is it just me or is that just absolutely redundant!? Also, I did not explicitly state whether the state or federal government should legalize gay marriage, but only that it should be legalized. The role of who should legalize it is of no concern in this debate. 2. 55% of Americans oppose gay marriage As I've stated before, just because a slight majority of Americans oppose gay marriage, this shows nothing on whether or not gay marriage should be legal, only that Americans oppose it. I respect their opinions, but this doesn't mean I agree with their opinions. Do note that a well 3/4 of America is Christian [1], and thus many would oppose gay marriage based solely on religious purposes. About 20% of Americans believe the sun revolves around the Earth [2], but does that give even an inkling on the merit of that claim? 3. Comment about ""Yeah, screw democracy"" First of all, I agreed with that statement in a partially sarcastic manner, though it probably wasn't clear. However, this is once again a FAILED argument. Not only should the comment section be out of the context of this debate, but whether or not I support democracy (which I do) has no merit on the legality of gay marriage. ""Homosexual Americans have EXACTLY the same rights as heterosexual Americans, no less and no more. Both groups of people are permitted to marry someone of the opposite sex."" --> EXCEPT MARRIAGE. Which is exactly the point of this debate. The point is, homosexual people want to marry, uh duh, the same gender! Not allowing them this option is taking away a right that is theirs. ~Conclusion~ In the progression of this brief debate, my opponent has given no substantial argument against gay marriage. The only feasible argument was his slippery slope argument, but he has failed to bring it back up. I tackled that argument in a new way, by asking him why polygamy, bestiality, or incest should be illegal if they all involve consenting adults. His recurring point is about 55% of Americans being opposed to gay marriage, but I clearly showed that to be a fallacious argument. For all the reasons I have shown, and for all the points I have refuted, vote for Pro. ---References--- 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>...",1,TheSkeptic,"

About 20% of Americans believe the sun revolves around the Earth [2], but does that give even an inkling on the merit of that claim?  
  
3. Comment about ""Yeah, screw democracy""  
  
First of all, I agreed with that statement in a partially sarcastic manner, though it probably wasn't clear. However, this is once again a FAILED argument. Not only should the comment section be out of the context of this debate, but whether or not I support democracy (which I do) has no merit on the legality of gay marriage.  
  
""Homosexual Americans have EXACTLY the same rights as heterosexual Americans, no less and no more. Both groups of people are permitted to marry someone of the opposite sex.""  
  
--> EXCEPT MARRIAGE. Which is exactly the point of this debate. The point is, homosexual people want to marry, uh duh, the same gender! Not allowing them this option is taking away a right that is theirs.  
  
~Conclusion~  
  
In the progression of this brief debate, my opponent has given no substantial argument against gay marriage. The only feasible argument was his slippery slope argument, but he has failed to bring it back up. I tackled that argument in a new way, by asking him why polygamy, bestiality, or incest should be illegal if they all involve consenting adults. His recurring point is about 55% of Americans being opposed to gay marriage, but I clearly showed that to be a fallacious argument. For all the reasons I have shown, and for all the points I have refuted, vote for Pro.

With that in mind, let me define the term of Communism from the Oxford Dictionary. Communism: First, it is a noun. It also has two definitions.

My first argument against your statements against communism is as follows: Why does the failure of an ideology in one country imply that it will persist in being a failure (if established in other countries)? I do not think this is an appropriate stance to take, and I will give an analogy that hopefully will prove helpful: I believe the use of currency is a more effective method for business (commerce). In current day Zimbabwe the inflation rate is about 300% and therefore currency is useless (without value). Therefore, the use of currency is not a more effective method for business. There could be many confounding variables that lead to the social and economical problems seen in Russia today (and of course in the past). There are many problems in non-communist countries today, does this mean we should abandon those systems and accept communism? I would argue that there were benefits that came through Communism in the Soviet Union; this ideology Stalin industrialized the Soviet Union in 10 years - a record pace and I doubt it would have been possible without the Utilitarianism-based Ethics system that supports Communism.

585,"Rebuttal The bulk of my opponent's argument quotes from the Bible. I will address his commentary directly. 1) CON: "" According to the Torah, animal sacrifices were made to atone for sin."" What makes this ""moral""? Why would God want man to destroy a part of His creation? Why would this please God? Without answers to such questions, my argument stands: "" What makes the butchering of animals different on a moral basis from the butchering of humans in the eyes of God is unexplained."" My conclusion also stands that the morality in the Bible is completely arbitrary. 2) CON: "" God tells Cain that if he does what is good then he will be accepted just as Abel, but Cain clearly refuses."" How is it clear that Cain does what is evil? There were no commandments regarding murder. There was no guideline from God or anyone else to stipulate what was good and what was evil. Even Adam and Eve were at least told beforehand what exactly constituted Biblical morality - don't eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Cain was not told anything. Keep in mind that Abel killed animals to satiate God, resulting in ""[the firstborn of his flock's] blood [crying] out to [God] from the ground"" (Genesis 4:10)."" Yet for some reason God found this pleasing. This reason is never explained in the Bible. If Abel did what was ""right,"" then what is ""right"" is to destroy a part of God's creation to please God. Cain did the same, he destroyed a part of God's creation by killing Abel...yet this did not please God. Going by this logic, the morality in the Bible is contradictory. 3) CON then uses 1 John 3:12 to support his argument, that "" Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous."" Here we run into the exact same problem. What was evil about Cain's actions? What was righteous about Abel's actions? 1 John 3:12 does not elaborate. Cain did not have the 10 commandments to instruct him on how to act. 4) CON's conclusion is extremely problematic: "" It is divinely instituted that Abel belonged to the righteous bloodline of the Messiah."" This is simply wrong: a) Abel belonged to the bloodline of Adam. It is through Adam that all of mankind is condemned to lead a life of sin. Like Adam, Abel was a sinner. Abel was not righteous, even if he strove for righteousness. Abel did not have any offspring, so it is impossible for Abel to have a bloodline from him. I must add that Cain also strove for righteousness...indeed it is Cain who first conceived of making offerings to God, not Abel, and not Adam or Eve. b) Christ was born via immaculate conception. He was not Joseph's son...he was the Son of God. c) In order for Abel to belong to the bloodline of Christ, Abel must have been born from Christ's offspring. This is an illogical and blasphemous assertion from CON on several levels, as it would require that Christ do what the Nephilim did in Genesis, i.e. procreate with humans, and would require Christ to have impregnated Eve to sire Abel, which is simply not Biblical. 5) The most egregious point against CON's argumentation is his advocacy of predetermination, that ""Cain was destined to commit this murder"" and thereby had no choice in the matter. This goes against most Christian teachings of the necessity of free will to give man a choice to accept and love God. If all of life and existence is predetermined, then it stands that God, who created all of life and existence, created the good AND the evil, and thus caused evil to come into existence. If so, then God is good AND evil and caused Satan to ""fall"" as well. This contradicts Biblical morality, that God is omnibenevolent ( <URL>... ). Conclusion My opponent has made a good number of assertions, but there is no reasonable basis for most of them, and some (such as Abel and Christ being related) are just flat out wrong. The Bible does not explain what is good and evil in the time of Cain and Abel. It does not explain why killing animals is good, while killing people is not good. It does not explain why God did not look upon Cain with favor. It does not explain what is sinful about the act of acquisition, whether it be knowledge or otherwise. Many of CON's arguments highlight various contradictions in Biblical morality, such as 1) an omnibenevolent and omnipotent God creating evil, and that 2) predetermination means that man cannot help but to sin, and God knew this before he created man and thus wished to curse man because it is His will, which again contradicts the omnibenevolence of God. I thus conclude after addressing all of CON's arguments that CON's rebuttal is invalid, and my arguments from round #2 remain uncontested.",1,wrichcirw,"

589,"I would also like to thank Zach for accepting my debate! My opponent states that 800 Palestinians have been killed in this battle while only 8 Israelis have been killed. I fail to see how this means that Israel's invasion is unjustified, especially since most of the Palestinians that were killed were members of the terrorist organization known as Hamas. Throughout the history of this conflict, Israel has done its utmost to limit the number of civilian deaths while the terrorists have done their utmost to maximize civilian deaths on both sides. My opponent claims that Israel violated the ceasefire 185 times, which is false. I would like to know where he is getting this information. The ceasefire was broken by Hamas, who continued to launch rockets into Israel in order to kill civilians. Throughout this conflict, we have seen Israel get attacked by terrorist groups only to find that they are condemned whenever they retaliate. Israel is the ONLY nation on this earth that is expected to not defend itself when attacked. Even countries that have acted the same way in similar situations have criticized Israel ie. Turkey. Israel cannot be expected to have rockets launched into its territory every day and take it with a smile. My opponents assertion that Israel doesn't have the right to do anything in the Middle East just because it is not a Muslim country is absurd. EVERY country has the right to defend itself regardless of what their religion is. The statement that Israel would be gone if it weren't for the US is an ignorant statement. Israel was able to defend itself in 1948, 1967, 1973, and against attacks in between without the help of the US. The Arab states that have attacked Israel were given aid by Russia just like we give Israel aid. My opponent claims that Hamas launches rockets because of Israel's blockade, which is another ignorant argument. If the Palestinians would renounce terrorism and give up violence, they wouldn't have to worry about blockades. Even so, the goal of Hamas is not to get Israel to lift the blockade. Hamas' goal is to destroy Israel and replace it with a Muslim state, so the blockade has nothing to do with Hamas' agenda. The history of this conflict shows that it is the Islamic Terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad that keep the violence going. If they would renounce violence, then there would be peace. Israel is perfectly justified in defending itself just as any other country would be.",1,Watchman81,"
  
I would also like to thank Zach for accepting my debate!  
  
My opponent states that 800 Palestinians have been killed in this battle while only 8 Israelis have been killed. I fail to see how this means that Israel's invasion is unjustified, especially since most of the Palestinians that were killed were members of the terrorist organization known as Hamas. Throughout the history of this conflict, Israel has done its utmost to limit the number of civilian deaths while the terrorists have done their utmost to maximize civilian deaths on both sides.  
  
My opponent claims that Israel violated the ceasefire 185 times, which is false. I would like to know where he is getting this information. The ceasefire was broken by Hamas, who continued to launch rockets into Israel in order to kill civilians. Throughout this conflict, we have seen Israel get attacked by terrorist groups only to find that they are condemned whenever they retaliate. Israel is the ONLY nation on this earth that is expected to not defend itself when attacked. Even countries that have acted the same way in similar situations have criticized Israel ie. Turkey. Israel cannot be expected to have rockets launched into its territory every day and take it with a smile.  
  
My opponents assertion that Israel doesn't have the right to do anything in the Middle East just because it is not a Muslim country is absurd. EVERY country has the right to defend itself regardless of what their religion is. The statement that Israel would be gone if it weren't for the US is an ignorant statement. Israel was able to defend itself in 1948, 1967, 1973, and against attacks in between without the help of the US. The Arab states that have attacked Israel were given aid by Russia just like we give Israel aid.  
  
My opponent claims that Hamas launches rockets because of Israel's blockade, which is another ignorant argument. If the Palestinians would renounce terrorism and give up violence, they wouldn't have to worry about blockades. Even so, the goal of Hamas is not to get Israel to lift the blockade. Hamas' goal is to destroy Israel and replace it with a Muslim state, so the blockade has nothing to do with Hamas' agenda.

595,"My argument here is that, for better or worse, rhetoric is more important than dialectic. This is in a few areas: 1) The art of persuasion, 2) Actual policy, and 3) The usefulness of language. First, rhetoric compresses nuanced meaning into words that accommodates the scarcity of attention span when discussing issues. That is by being artistic rather than logical, ordinary listeners can more easily pay attention and relate with what is being said. Lingo and jargon is ineffective and comes off as arrogant, but figurative language is down to earth and simpler to understand. Second, rhetoric shows inside information over how actual policy can be construed and enacted. A rhetorician demonstrates an understanding of how words can be interpreted in multiple ways as well as how word games can be played. Therefore, a rhetorician is an expert not only in composing ordinary language, but also in anticipating misinterpretation and doing what's needed to prevent it. Third, language is not merely an ideal set and syntax of words, but is an actual tool for directing others. A rhetorician understands this technique beyond simply being logical, but rather triggers an audience's switches in order to get desired results. This can even take place if the audience is not logically rigorous or methodical. Sometimes, people have pragmatic prejudices in their interpretations of words, so practice can happen by appealing to prejudice.

Therefore, my logic is reasonable and free of personal emotional perceptions. Tatarize: You can't force a women to carry a child to term against her will, regardless who provided some DNA to it. The notion that fathers are just ""sperm and DNA"" seems to be paramount to you. Tatarize: The fact you're arguing is that it isn't her choice. You're right. It isn't her choice. It's the choice of both parents. Tatarize: Children aren't worth money. Is the father going to sue for all the child support he'll never have to pay? It's not about the money. It's about the fact that a man's son or daughter was aborted without his knowledge or consent. Given that the child would now be dead, what other recourse could the father seek other than money? Some kind of penalty has to be put in place. A simple, ""I'm sorry"" from the mother won't cut it. Tatarize: THERE'S NO CHILD! Your entire argument is predicated on being a responsible man demands women be turned into forced birthers. There is a child. It is a child who was conceived by a mother and father. Any suggestion to the contrary is false. Tatarize: Fathers should love their children. They should be the best dads they can be. They should provide and help (mothers should do the same) and do everything in their powers to make their children happy, healthy and safe. Above you state the father is no more than some DNA. Now you're saying the father becomes a person who should be the best dad he can be. Either you're not firm on your position of fathers being just sperm donors or you're taking the double standard position regarding fathers I refer to in round one.

They asked local churches to pray for them. Based on the location (US) it seems likely that the vast majority were Christian, as this makes up 78% of the population [1] plus the many who are spiritual, but not part of any religion.  
  
""My opponent makes a mistake because he shows faith does work even when they believe something hurts them.""  
  
The topic is that faith can help to cure sickness, not whether it can kill a person.  
  
""Wow, that was not a good thing done on the doctors' behalf. It was not right of them to take away an effect that worked. Basically, they took away the faith of the patients. This goes to show, faith works.(2)""  
  
It is not faith in the divine sense. We are debating that faith in a higher power can help to heal, not that faith in medicine heals. And they were not 'taking away' anything. I do not understand what you mean.  
  
""The Bible demonstrates faith healing. That is your ultimate proof.""  
  
The bible is untestable, and unproven. This is a terrible source and heavily biased.  
  
In short, you have failed to prove that faith is better then placebos, and I have shown a reliable study where faith was detrimental to the patients recovery, and no other correlations were shown. We cannot draw conclusions on anything, and to all accounts by reliable doctors, and neuroscientists who did the experiment I talked about and several others, the brain controls a lot of symptoms and can fight the illness. This is not faith that kills the illness, it is the brain. The brain is a powerful thing, and giving someone a sugar pill is just as useful as telling someone to pray about it, and sometimes praying on it causes a negative reaction to the stimulant, causing more complications and death.

Worker cooperatives collectively own and control the means of production. Hence the system which I described fits within this definition. There are other parts of this definition which must be jettisoned if we want to talk about socialism in the traditional sense of the word. ""It also makes individuals dependent on the state for everything from food to healthcare."" That only applies to a system of public ownership and control, not a system of collective ownership and control. Therefore, my opponent's definition is contradicting itself. Furthermore, there are many different types of socialists. Granted, many socialists have wanted to expand the state, but many socialists have wanted to dismantle the state. I'm not arguing for either alternative. I'm merely arguing for collective, or cooperative ownership of the means of production, and democratic control. ""China, Vietnam, and Cuba... Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and the U.S.S.R."" The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was as Republican as it was Socialist. The names are deceptive. The U.S.S.R. should have been called the Empire of Statist Dictatorships. You see, during the Russian Revolution in 1917, there was, at first, a potential for the development of true socialism. Worker's Councils were enabling Russian workers to democratically own and control the means of production. As I pointed out in round 1, worker ownership and control of the means of production is what socialists have traditionally advocated. However, by 1921, Lenin dismantled the worker's councils. Lenin himself said that Russia was not ready for socialism. The Bolshevik Party would keep the country ready for socialism, waiting until revolutions in more advanced societies. The Soviet model was not socialist since it didn't have worker's control of the means of production. The same could be said of China, Vietnam, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany. None of these countries were ever socialist. It is easy for my opponent to argue against a straw man and to list all of the countries which called themselves socialist without actually being socialist. However, I think it would be far more productive for my opponent to argue against socialism as I defined it. This is, after all, a more traditional conception of socialism. Worker control and ownership is advocated by a wide range of Socialists, from Democratic Socialists to Anarchists to Council Communists/ Left-Marxists. Even if we go with my opponent's definition, the words ""collective ownership"" allow for an economy of worker cooperatives. I didn't have any space to present my contentions in Round 1. Now I do have space. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to put this in the first round, but since we aren't in the last round, it's okay to present contentions. Contention 1: Capitalism exploits workers; Socialism pays workers fairly. In order to make a profit, a Capitalist firm must spend less money than it makes. Moreover, the cost of producing and selling a product must be lower than the price of that product. I think we can all agree with that. This means that the people who produce and sell a product must be paid less money than the revenue which they generate through their labor. In other words, workers must be exploited if corporations are going to make any profit. This is basic logic, but maybe you still aren't convinced. If not, then I implore you to look at the numbers. Since 1948 average American pay went up 113% which sounds great until you learn that average productivity went up 254%. People are being paid less than half of what they produce. Socialism is more fair because when a worker cooperative spends less money than it makes, the profit goes back to the people who produced it -- the workers. Not only are wages voted on, but the excess revenue people produce goes to the people who produce it. Contention 2: Capitalism undermines democracy; Socialism strengthens democracy. In our Capitalist society, corporations and the individuals who get rich thanks to corporations have such a disproportionate amount of wealth that they can buy disproportionate amounts of political power. A Princeton study shows how damaging this is for democracy. ""A proposed policy change with low support among economically elite Americans (one-out-of-five in favour) is adopted only about 18% of the time,"" they write, ""while a proposed change with high support (four-out-of-five in favour) is adopted about 45% of the time.""

To support my position of the affirmative in this debate, I would like to remind the readers that thus far I have cited many examples in which GWB's leadership and deicision making has done more harm than good to the United States. Because he is our Commander in Chief, he can be and certainly is held responsible to a degree for our successes and failures as a nation. So far in the past 8 years, GWB's actions have been directly attributed and/or contributed to the realities that face our country today: a bankrupted economy; an illegal and unsupported war; a betrayed and apprehensive society (most of whom do not support the policies of our President); etc. Although GWB has succeeded in some (few) areas, most of his 'good deeds' are exaggerated or untrue. I have cited examples of his failues/successes earlier in the debate. In my opinion, a President who has *so many* F-ups in comparison to *so little* good moves is a bad one. Everybody makes mistakes every now and again, but I expect my Commander in Chief and the most powerful man in the world to use his power wisely and not be wrong 99% of the time. I don't think that George W. Bush is a bad person (I don't know him personally) or the worst president in United States history as many people ignorantly assume. I'd even go so far as to note that America could have possibly benefited from a Republican being elected into the White House back in 2000. However Bush's shady practices in addition to all that went wrong on account of him and his politics (including the failures of those he appointed to be his running mate, make up his Cabinet, etc.) just prove that he was not the right man for the job.",1,Danielle,"

Because he is our Commander in Chief, he can be and certainly is held responsible to a degree for our successes and failures as a nation.  
  
So far in the past 8 years, GWB's actions have been directly attributed and/or contributed to the realities that face our country today: a bankrupted economy; an illegal and unsupported war; a betrayed and apprehensive society (most of whom do not support the policies of our President); etc. Although GWB has succeeded in some (few) areas, most of his 'good deeds' are exaggerated or untrue. I have cited examples of his failues/successes earlier in the debate. In my opinion, a President who has *so many* F-ups in comparison to *so little* good moves is a bad one. Everybody makes mistakes every now and again, but I expect my Commander in Chief and the most powerful man in the world to use his power wisely and not be wrong 99% of the time.  
  
I don't think that George W. Bush is a bad person (I don't know him personally) or the worst president in United States history as many people ignorantly assume. I'd even go so far as to note that America could have possibly benefited from a Republican being elected into the White House back in 2000. However Bush's shady practices in addition to all that went wrong on account of him and his politics (including the failures of those he appointed to be his running mate, make up his Cabinet, etc.) just prove that he was not the right man for the job.",Politics,2,George-W.-Bush-is-a-bad-president./1/,13896

632,"Since this is the last round,i would like to thank Con for participating in this debate. It was fun and interesting. It's also interesting to see Con has made false assumptions and mistakes AGAIN. Just to correct you,where you said ""So Con's analogy does accomplish nothing"" You probably meant Pro,just to clarify that. Con did nothing to disprove my arguments,let's take a look. First of all,Con used Newton's quote in attempt to bolster his claim. This was argument from authority fallacy. While Newton did a great job at explaining laws of motion and ""discovering gravity"" (for what he is famous,needless to say),he also believed in alchemy. Newton's quote doesn't prove/disprove anything. If Newton knew about evolution/abiogenesis theories and the evidence for them at that time (which did not exist at the time), i doubt that he would make the same quote. Next i recap that we have experimented with amino-accids,proteins,RNA and DNA. A research has been done that i think Con and our audience should check out [1] The Christian view requires fewer assumptions? Yes,but not in the world of science,not in the world of rationalism. It is extremely easy to believe that God created everything. Hmm that seems possible,since science can't explain many things. Well science has refuted many creationist claims that God is necessary. People believed that the world is flat,people believed that bird blood can cure leprosy,people believed that the Earth is the center of the universe,people believed that Earth was made 6000 years ago,...just to name a few. We have proven that Earth is older than 6000 years old using radiometric dating. And every type of RMD indicates,when a sample is examined, that the Earth is older than 6000 years. All the creationist beliefs are based on a single book. ""But evolutionists prefer abiogenesis simply because it avoids God."" Wrong! A typical straw man. Evolutionists/scientists prefer abiogenesis because there are thousands of evidence supporting it (most of those are about evolution as well),in contrary to creationism,which has,if not 0,then minuscule amount of evidence for reality,and those are just a few simple things we know today,and people knew then when using their brains. And many ""abiogenesis believers"" do believe in a God. These are known as deists. Although they don't believe in a God resembling anything like a Christian God. We went away from the topic way more than i expected. Although i had to answer these arguments,if you can call them that. I never said probability is meaningless about determining the chances about the past. I said that it's meaningless when explaining the impossibility of something in the past. And this is only for things that we have evidence for happened. ""We can conclude, based on probability, that some things definitely never happened (like abiogenesis). And, as I pointed out, if our view of history requires something impossible to happen, it is probably wrong."" Did you ignore my proofs in the last two rounds? Abiogenesis is NOT IMPOSSIBLE,i have proven this. I have also linked my source [1] for you to check out. ""The reason evolutionists believe in the abiogenesis hypothesis is because excluding God, it's their only hope of explaining our life-filled world. Unfortunately, abiogenesis is, practically, impossible, which means that abiogenesis should remain a hypothesis and a failed one at that."" *facepalm* Again, a straw man. And i am not going to repeat myself again for the second sentence. I said,and i repeat,that a chance of a raindrop hitting your nose is definite. Let's take your version of the analogy. I want to pick a grain of sand. What is the chance that i will pick a grain of sand? The answer is: definite. But now as i am walking away,i ask myself: ""What was the chance that i would have picked this particular grain of sand""? And the answer is 1:30.000.000 (taking your chance). The question ""What is the chance that i WILL pick a particular grain of sand"" is another story. You can't choose a particular grain of sand for the future,you can just describe it. Like: What is the chance that i will pick a cube-shaped grain of sand at random? Then 1:30.000.000 becomes applicable. If asking about the past: ""What was the chance that i would have picked this particular grain of sand""? the answer is 1:30.000.000 again,but it already happened,we have proof that it happened,we are holding that grain of sand in our hands. [Caps lock] THIS IS WHY THE PROBABILITY ARGUMENT FAILS WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE PAST. IT IS MEANINGLESS WHEN TRYING TO PROVE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THE PAST,OF WHICH WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE FOR. Now Con's only counter-argument would be that the proofs for abiogenesis don't exist. But i would beg to differ. That is a discussion for another time. ""Information does not come from chaos."" This is a really vague claim open to equivocation. If you meant ""Order does not come from chaos"" or ""Order does not come from disorder"" I will disagree with you. First answer: It depends on what we perceive as ""order"" and ""chaos"". We might be living in a chaotic state,but we perceive it as order.. This is a more philosophical question. Second answer is about 2nd law of thermodynamics [2] (which you might have been referring to). This article contains some extra information about creationism too. So to recap what we have concluded: 1. We have concluded that nothing in our physical world is impossible as long as it doesn't break any laws of physics. 2. We don't need probabilities to help us determine the chances of something happening in the past (impossibility), since it does nothing to disprove that something. 3. Once we've established the 2nd premise, we can conclude that abiogenesis is both mathematically and practically possible,since it doesn't break any laws of nature. (plus we have done multiple experiments to prove it) Conclusion: Probability argument falls flat when used to disprove the possibility of abiogenesis.

With that said, my position in this debate is that George W. Bush was and still is a bad president throughout his tenure in office. My reasoning is based on these factors:  
  
- His broken promises regarding healthcare, the enviornment, higher education, free trade, and welfare;  
  
- Lies he told to the American public (probably to promote his own agenda);  
  
- His extremely low approval rating;  
  
- Facts about negative occurences during GWB's presidency, that are directly attributed to and/or are a result of his actions such as: the record for biggest annual deficit in history, he presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and refused to intervene when corruption was revealed, he is he dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history, etc...  
  
Because I am the instigator (Pro), the burden of proof is on me to prove that George W. Bush was/is a bad President. I believe that the facts and statistics speak volumes, so I will give my opponent the first opportunity to make his or her case against the topic of debate. Good luck!",Politics,0,George-W.-Bush-is-a-bad-president./1/,13894

First of all, Uniforms are worn at schools so there won't be any gang colors being worn, and also so no one can make fun of you if you wear clothes from Wal-Mart, or a place that isn't ""popular"" like Hollister, or Aeropostale. But if someone is going to make fun of you because your not rich, they can still make fun of you. Uniforms don't hide how much money you have. And if someone is going to make fun of your clothes, and you have a uniform on, they will find something else to make fun of you for. And gangs can't be stopped just because they have to wear a uniform to school. They can ""throw up"" gang signs and stuff like that while they are at school, uniforms or not. It is also not fair to the people who followed the dress code before the school got uniforms.

651,"Firstly, a big thanks to Con for accepting and I look forward to a thoughtful, respectful debate. Secondly, my absolute sincerest apologies. I feel the quality and length of this round could have been much better. We are in the midst of moving and whatever I managed to get to in between packing/unpacking boxes is written below. Thus, the content is very simple, and limited (particularly the environmental benefits which I didn't have time to get into as much as I would have preferred.) Hopefully the coming days will be a little less hectic and once again, my apologies. I hope the simplicity of the first round can be pardoned and apologize if it is an inconvenience. Let's get started. I will be debating in favor of the implementation of solar road highways within the US. First, a brief explanation of what a solar roadway would entail: A solar roadway is a road surface that generates electricity by solar power photovoltaics. [1] The idea, according to the company Solar Roadways, is to replace existing asphalt roads, highways, parking lots, and driveways with solar road panels. Each panel, 12'*12', would consist of three layers. The top layer is the road surface, the middle layer (also known as the electronics layer) contains the microprocessor board, and the base plate layer distributes the power collected. Both the top and bottom layers are weatherproof in order to protect the electronic pieces between them. Contention 1: Safety The solar road panels provide many benefits, one being increased safety on the roads. The surface layer of the roadways will be textured in such a way that it increases traction, allowing tires to grip the surface with more durability. [2] In addition, LED lights will be included within the surface layer, designed to light up roads at night and create electronic highway signals, alerting drivers of weather conditions or any interferences on the road. [3] The solar roads also contain a heating element, that could warm up in cold weather to melt snow and ice, preventing cities form shutting down during bad weather, such as heavy snowstorms.[1] [4] Such implementation could go a long way in preventing accidents, and increasing overall security for drivers and pedestrians alike. Contention 2: Economy Being of renewable energy, solar roadways are generally self-maintained and will ultimately end up paying for the cost of production and repairs of the panels. The amount of energy gathered and stored would provide excess electricity that could be sold, thus becoming self sufficient. [3] Another benefit to the economy involves employment. New jobs would be created in the manufacturing of panels. The Solar Roadways website [5] estimates that in regards to panel production alone, the implementation of these highways could result in 2.5 million full time jobs for at least a ten year period. Contention 3: Environmental Benefits Solar energy has obvious benefits on the environment, and such a large scale operation offers a wide range of benefits as well. The most obvious among them is eliminating the necessity of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere in order to produce electricity. Another, less conventional, idea involves the increasing production of electric cars. Though currently electronic cars have a relatively short range and must be recharged often, the implementation of solar roadways could eliminate that. Owners of EV's can plug their cars into solar road panels and recharge them at rest stops . Engineers are currently evaluating the possibility of charging cars as they drive. The increased use of EV's and solar road highways could theoretically eliminate the need for oil as an energy source.

Firstly, a big thanks to Con for accepting and I look forward to a thoughtful, respectful debate.  
  
Secondly, my absolute sincerest apologies. I feel the quality and length of this round could have been much better. We are in the midst of moving and whatever I managed to get to in between packing/unpacking boxes is written below. Thus, the content is very simple, and limited (particularly the environmental benefits which I didn't have time to get into as much as I would have preferred.) Hopefully the coming days will be a little less hectic and once again, my apologies. I hope the simplicity of the first round can be pardoned and apologize if it is an inconvenience.  
  
Let's get started.  
  
I will be debating in favor of the implementation of solar road highways within the US.  
  
First, a brief explanation of what a solar roadway would entail:  
A solar roadway is a road surface that generates electricity by solar power photovoltaics. [1] The idea, according to the company Solar Roadways, is to replace existing asphalt roads, highways, parking lots, and driveways with solar road panels.  
Each panel, 12'*12', would consist of three layers. The top layer is the road surface, the middle layer (also known as the electronics layer) contains the microprocessor board, and the base plate layer distributes the power collected. Both the top and bottom layers are weatherproof in order to protect the electronic pieces between them.  
  
Contention 1: Safety  
  
The solar road panels provide many benefits, one being increased safety on the roads. The surface layer of the roadways will be textured in such a way that it increases traction, allowing tires to grip the surface with more durability. [2] In addition, LED lights will be included within the surface layer, designed to light up roads at night and create electronic highway signals, alerting drivers of weather conditions or any interferences on the road. [3] The solar roads also contain a heating element, that could warm up in cold weather to melt snow and ice, preventing cities form shutting down during bad weather, such as heavy snowstorms.[1] [4] Such implementation could go a long way in preventing accidents, and increasing overall security for drivers and pedestrians alike.  
  
Contention 2: Economy  
  
Being of renewable energy, solar roadways are generally self-maintained and will ultimately end up paying for the cost of production and repairs of the panels. The amount of energy gathered and stored would provide excess electricity that could be sold, thus becoming self sufficient. [3] Another benefit to the economy involves employment. New jobs would be created in the manufacturing of panels. The Solar Roadways website [5] estimates that in regards to panel production alone, the implementation of these highways could result in 2.5 million full time jobs for at least a ten year period.  
  
Contention 3: Environmental Benefits  
  
Solar energy has obvious benefits on the environment, and such a large scale operation offers a wide range of benefits as well. The most obvious among them is eliminating the necessity of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere in order to produce electricity.  
Another, less conventional, idea involves the increasing production of electric cars. Though currently electronic cars have a relatively short range and must be recharged often, the implementation of solar roadways could eliminate that. Owners of EV's can plug their cars into solar road panels and recharge them at rest stops . Engineers are currently evaluating the possibility of charging cars as they drive. The increased use of EV's and solar road highways could theoretically eliminate the need for oil as an energy source. [6]  
  
Contention 4: Convenience  
There are several reasons why the utilization of solar road panels are convenient.  
1) Durability. [1]  
The life span of these panels are estimated to be about 30-40 years, about three times the life span of current asphalt roads (7-12 years).  
2) Panels can be built upon the roadways that are already in place. [1]  
The current roadways can be used, destroying them to put the solar panels in place is not necessary.  
  
I'm running against the deadline here with five minutes to post. So, a quick spell check and up it goes.  
  
Looking forward to Con's arguments.

652,"Thank you for the answer, Con. Now i shall proceed with a rebuttal. Con admitted that given enough time, one could theoretically hit a certain point on a dartboard. Now that that is settled,let's see what Con presented. ""Pro erred concerning the area of points on the tip of the dart. There are a an infinite number of points there as well."" True,there are infinite number of points on the tip of the arrow (i prefer to call it arrow). But i was talking about the measurable area that hits the dartboard. That area is NOT a mathematical point,once again. If we were to look at it like Con did,the infinite number of points on the arrow will hit the infinite number of points on the fraction of the dartboard. In this case we have two infinites to deal with and we cannot make any proportion with just infinites. 1/infinity is undefined as infinity is not a number. But we know that if a number we are dividing with approaches infinity (in 1/x , x->infinity) then the product number is approaching 0. If the number is extremely small,we can start treating it as 0,but it is not the actual 0. So if you choose an AREA on the dartboard (that is the area of the tip of the arrow or bigger,say 2cm^2) Then chances are, of course bigger than 1/x , x->infinity,because x in this case does not go towards infinity,but is a finite number. I used the example with mathematical points to explain that the concept of infinity is meaningless to the argument,therefore proving that the chances of something happening are greater than 0. Of course that something had to happen within the constant laws of physics. In this case it's the past. We have enough proof of amino-acids combining to form proteins (we depend on that),and we have been able to prove that it is possible and even project it and see what could have happened. Just like if we choose an area of the dart so small that we have 10^67 chance to hit, given the time of 100 billion years. Though this is only the chance of that happening, it does not mean that it has to happen in the exact 100 billion years. We can hit that small area that we have 1 in 10^67 chance in one try. It is possible. It is also possible that proteins necessary for life can form in 1 billion years and less. We are not breaking any laws here. By this i proved that Con's claim that my analogy accomplishes nothing is false. I do not understand this from Con,i beg him to explain this sentence to me: ""The probability for life coming about, on the other hand, is the dartboard equivelant to the probability for making a bull's eye once during one's entire life."" Moving on: Occam's razor doesn't always mean that a solution with fewest assumptions is true. Con's Columbus analogy assumes that a law must be broke in order of something being achieved,that is, the law needs to be broke for that something to be achieved. It is possible and practical that someone altered the sources and did that unscathed. The example is with Hitler, sources tell that he shot himself in the bunker,but i read the news earlier this year on a popular website and in the newspaper that Hitler was alive,living in South America for 20-ish more years or so after the war. Though this is quite arbitrary,it is theoretically possible and ""practical"",since no one else saw Hitler's body besides a few dozen of his generals,before being thrown in a hole and lit on fire,so the allies wouldn't find/identify the body. And he was known for having an identical double. Now let the assumptions fly all over the place. ""Ahem. Probability is the chance something will happen in the future. We are taking the pre-life view on earth for the purposes of this discussion. We can't calculate the probability of an event that's already happened. It's over. However, we can calculate the possibility that a view of history is correct. Pro could be arguing here that life did arise from non-life, and that therefore the event of abiogenesis occuring was obviously possible. However, that argument falls flat also. Why? Because abiogenesis was not recorded historically, and there is no evidence for it."" So if probability is the chance something will happen in the future, then it means that probability is not meant for explaining the past. Well that is the point. Probability argument fails when it comes to explaining the past,it's meaningless! The evidence for abiogenesis is not relevant to this debate. And also scientists propose multiple number of hypotheses and then test them. The ones that pass the test become theories. So far we have a lot of evidence that life came from non-life during a series of chemical reactions. Now how exactly it came,scientists are still not sure,but as science progresses, we will eventually have the answer. Since this is not relevant to the debate,i will not go into detail here. For the raindrop analogy...Yes the chances of a raindrop to hit your nose is definite. But a chance raindrop that did hit your nose in the past,to actually hit your nose is 1 in 10^58 as i calculated. We are talking about that particular raindrop. See what is happening here? For your closing example you are looking at the Rushmore mountain faces as an uninformed person and assume that they formed naturally. However it's not just the calculating you have to do,as you already know. You have to do a research,collect the evidence and then form a theory. This is what scientists did. The theory of abiogenesis from non-life is a valid theory. You falsely assume in your final example that scientists are uninformed about the topic under discussion and research. That is all from me, can't wait to hear Con's rebuttal. Good luck!",1,chewster911,"

Now since you are Pro, the burden is on you to prove the resolution to be true. Even if I agree with you, you have offered no acceptable evidence that would compel anyone to vote Pro. You mentioned chanting songs that repeat phrases like ""Get your t~ts out"" are acceptable because most women oblige, however you cannot prove that to be true (personal experience doesn't count, because I can say that in MY personal experience, that is not the case).  
  
I don't think men are too restricted in what they can say; they can say anything they want, and unless it's unlawful, they will not be penalized other than MAYBE having a few people call them sexist. To that I say quit whining and grow a pair of balls! You're saying that women shouldn't bit",Society,0,Freedom-of-expression-should-not-be-supressed-by-accusations-of-sexism./1/,12677

By looking at Bernie Sanders' website, specifically on a page titled ""How Bernie pays for his proposals,"" it is evident that Bernie will enact policies that, in order to be paid for, will require an increase in payroll taxes and the income taxes of individuals, particularly high-income individuals. After looking at this page, I added up the costs of each of those programs, as well as the amount of added revenue after the tax increases. Under Bernie Sanders' plan, tax revenue will increase $13.6 trillion over the next decade. This will include revenue from the new 6.2% employer-side payroll tax and the new 2.2% broad-based income tax. Overall, the marginal tax rates would be significantly increased, as well as the cost of capital and the amount of capital needed to start a business. As a result, the GDP would decrease 9.5 percent long term. After that decade is over, the increase in taxes ""would lead to a 10.56% lower after-tax income for"" the bottom 99% ""and 17.91 percent lower after-tax income for the top 1 percent.

Currently, people do not pay taxes on the value of the health insurance provided by their employers. Were people to pay taxes on this today, federal tax revenue would increase by over $300 billion.[4] Under Bernie's plan, though, privately-provided insurance would go away; instead, employers will have to add the value of the insurance policies they used to provide to their employees' paychecks. This ends up increasing said employee's taxable income. Furthermore, employers would be required to pay employer-side payroll taxes on that new income. This adds up to $3.6 trillion in added federal revenue.[2] After taking into account the reduction of the GDP? (36*10^11) - ((36*10^11)*.095) = $3.25 trillion. Presently in 2016, there are currently 7 federal income tax brackets.[5] Under Sanders' plan, two more brackets are added, and their rates are increased. For example, if you make $10 million or more each year, 52% of your income is taxed. Between $2 and $10 billion a year? 48%. Furthermore, if your wealth exceeds $1 billion, an extra 10% is added to your estate tax.[2](Estate tax increases anywhere from 5% to 25%[3].) Now, in addition to ordinary income, there is also taxation on capital gains and dividends. We know that dividends are taxed twice: Once as income and then again a second time. If you make more than $10 million a year, you end up paying at least 104% of what you received in dividends. It does not take an economics major to see that there is a problem with paying more than you received.[3] Under Bernie Sanders' new tax proposal and spending plan, the GDP would decrease 9.5%. Capital investment would decrease 18.6%. Average wages (after taxes) would go down 4.3%. Approximately 6 million full-time jobs will be lost. This would, to say it softly, crush the economy. Bernie Sanders would also increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15.00 an hour. Now, the existence of a minimum wage is an entirely different debate on its own, so I will not go into detail right now, but there are a few key points I need to go over concerning it. A minimum wage decreases the amount of low-skilled jobs. A wage should reflect the amount of work the job demands. Is a door opener at a hotel worth $15 an hour? No. Is it worth $7.25? Probably. Increasing the minimum wage would also increase the cost of running a business and having employees. While this could change in the long run, it will ultimately remove certain jobs from existence and kick out those who are employed in those positions. I will now go on to talk about trade. Bernie Sanders is opposed to free trade. In a page on his site, ""On the Issues: Income and Wealth Inequality,"" it says, ""Reversing trade policies like NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China that have driven down wages and caused the loss of millions of jobs. If corporate America wants us to buy their products they need to manufacture those products in this country, not in China or other low-wage countries."" This shows a lack of knowledge of the issues. If Bernie knew what it was like to run a business, he could see that this is a ridiculous concept. One cannot just dictate business activity so recklessly when it will have unintended consequences, which this would. Also, free trade boosts not only our economy, but the global economy as well. While yes, American companies employ people in other countries, foreign companies also employ Americans. It it not a one-way concept. Toyota, for example, is a Japanese company but employs over 30,000 Americans.[7] Furthermore, the gender wage gap, which Bernie's site calls ""an outrage,"" is a myth.[6] Yes, on average, women get paid less than men, but this is not for the same job. Women tend to have jobs that pay, on average, 78 cents to the average dollar a man makes. It is not for the same job, it is an overall average.

  Introduction  
  I would like to begin by thanking WilliamsP for accepting this debate. Let us get started.  
  Arguments  
  I will begin by detailing some key facts about Bernie Sanders’ economic plan.  
  By looking at Bernie Sanders’ website, specifically on a page titled “How Bernie pays for his proposals,” it is evident that Bernie will enact policies that, in order to be paid for, will require an increase in payroll taxes and the income taxes of individuals, particularly high-income individuals. After looking at this page, I added up the costs of each of those programs, as well as the amount of added revenue after the tax increases.  
  Under Bernie Sanders’ plan, tax revenue will increase $13.6 trillion over the next decade. This will include revenue from the new 6.2% employer-side payroll tax and the new 2.2% broad-based income tax. Overall, the marginal tax rates would be significantly increased, as well as the cost of capital and the amount of capital needed to start a business. As a result, the GDP would decrease 9.5 percent long term. After that decade is over, the increase in taxes “would lead to a 10.56% lower after-tax income for” the bottom 99% “and 17.91 percent lower after-tax income for the top 1 percent. When accounting for reduced GDP, after-tax incomes of all taxpayers would fall by at least 12.84%.[3]  
  Another source of tax revenue under Sanders’ plan comes from healthcare. Currently, people do not pay taxes on the value of the health insurance provided by their employers. Were people to pay taxes on this today, federal tax revenue would increase by over $300 billion.[4] Under Bernie’s plan, though, privately-provided insurance would go away; instead, employers will have to add the value of the insurance policies they used to provide to their employees’ paychecks. This ends up increasing said employee’s taxable income. Furthermore, employers would be required to pay employer-side payroll taxes on that new income. This adds up to $3.6 trillion in added federal revenue.[2] After taking into account the reduction of the GDP? (36*10^11) - ((36*10^11)*.095) = $3.25 trillion.  
  Presently in 2016, there are currently 7 federal income tax brackets.[5] Under Sanders’ plan, two more brackets are added, and their rates are increased. For example, if you make $10 million or more each year, 52% of your income is taxed. Between $2 and $10 billion a year? 48%. Furthermore, if your wealth exceeds $1 billion, an extra 10% is added to your estate tax.[2](Estate tax increases anywhere from 5% to 25%[3].) Now, in addition to ordinary income, there is also taxation on capital gains and dividends. We know that dividends are taxed twice: Once as income and then again a second time.

It does not take an economics major to see that there is a problem with paying more than you received.[3]  
  Under Bernie Sanders’ new tax proposal and spending plan, the GDP would decrease 9.5%. Capital investment would decrease 18.6%. Average wages (after taxes) would go down 4.3%. Approximately 6 million full-time jobs will be lost. This would, to say it softly, crush the economy.  
  Bernie Sanders would also increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15.00 an hour. Now, the existence of a minimum wage is an entirely different debate on its own, so I will not go into detail right now, but there are a few key points I need to go over concerning it. A minimum wage decreases the amount of low-skilled jobs. A wage should reflect the amount of work the job demands. Is a door opener at a hotel worth $15 an hour? No. Is it worth $7.25? Probably. Increasing the minimum wage would also increase the cost of running a business and having employees. While this could change in the long run, it will ultimately remove certain jobs from existence and kick out those who are employed in those positions.  
  I will now go on to talk about trade.  Bernie Sanders is opposed to free trade. In a page on his site, ""On the Issues: Income and Wealth Inequality,"" it says, ""Reversing trade policies like NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China that have driven down wages and caused the loss of millions of jobs. If corporate America wants us to buy their products they need to manufacture those products in this country, not in China or other low-wage countries."" This shows a lack of knowledge of the issues. If Bernie knew what it was like to run a business, he could see that this is a ridiculous concept. One cannot just dictate business activity so recklessly when it will have unintended consequences, which this would. Also, free trade boosts not only our economy, but the global economy as well. While yes, American companies employ people in other countries, foreign companies also employ Americans. It it not a one-way concept. Toyota, for example, is a Japanese company but employs over 30,000 Americans.[7]  Furthermore, the gender wage gap, which Bernie's site calls ""an outrage,"" is a myth.[6] Yes, on average, women get paid less than men, but this is not for the same job. Women tend to have jobs that pay, on average, 78 cents to the average dollar a man makes. It is not for the same job, it is an overall average.  Conclusion  I believe I have sufficiently given a good amount of facts in opposition to a Bernie Sanders presidency. I look forward to my opponent's arguments in favor of it.

669,"I thank my opponent for his argument. I will briefly rebut the argument that Con gave me. REBUTTAL All Con said during his second round was that cigarette is harmful. He listed various ways that cigarette can be harmful. In this debate discussing about the total ban of cigarette, there are two things that Con has to show: 1) that harm of cigarette calls for radical action of ban, 2) that the ban is a plausible action. Con failed to fulfill both criteria by only giving medical argument, omitting the explanation as to why such medical factors call for ban. Con's entire round 2 can be rebutted in different layers. Just about anything can harm one's health. Smoke from factories, electricity and cars kill people in many ways. Just because something is bad, it does not equal to a ban. Just because cars emit smoke, cause accidents and require factories in the process of manufacture, we do not ban cars since benefit outweighs the harm. Again, smokers are aware of these harms of smoking and yet they still choose to smoke. Moreover, cigarette provides recreational activity to individuals. Additionally, Con failed to combat other benefits that we lose by banning cigarette and benefits we gain from keeping cigarette. By banning cigarette, we are also hugely limiting freedom and rights of citizen. We are also oppressing industry that worth hundreds of billion dollars, placing workers of this humongous industry out of work and losing billions of tax revenue. Despite all these drawbacks in several aspects, does it still worth to ban cigarette? Con obviously failed to answer this question. I look forward reading round 3.",1,Ike-Jin-Park,"

673,"Thanks for the opening argument. I don't necessarily agree with the entirety of the position I'm arguing, but its good to explore both sides a topic. Framework : To determine which trait is superior, we should look to which one leads to the greatest happiness for the person. The reasoning is that happiness is what almost all humans are inherently trying to achieve, and the resolution implies a comparison of traits for the average person. So judges should vote for which trait produces the most happiness based on the arguments made in the debate round. C1: Happiness ""Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know."" - Ernest Hemingway Bill Allin finds that intelligent people are empirically less happy that others (1). The reasoning is that ""Western society is not set up to nurture intelligent children and adults, the way it dotes over athletes and sports figures, especially the outstanding ones. While we have the odd notable personality such as Albert Einstein, we also have many extremely intelligent people working in occupations that are considered among the lowliest...."" ""Education systems in countries whose primary interest is in wealth accumulation encourage heroes in movies, war and sports, but not in intellectual development. Super intelligent people manage, but few reach the top of the business or social ladder."" Additionally, intelligent people are at a higher risk for depression (2) and people who get mental illnesses tend to be above average in intelligence (3). Moreover, people with high IQ scores engage in sexual activity much less frequently. In high school, "" Each additional point of IQ increased the odds of virginity by 2.7% for males and 1.7% for females "" (4). Also, intelligent people generally had less premarital sex partners than people with lower IQ scores and even has less sex within marriage ."" This is problematic because sex is good. WebMD Health writes, "" Overall, the happiest folks are those getting the most sex....People who consider themselves happy are usually richer in sexual activity ."" (5) Second, popularity correlates with more happiness. By definition, popular people have a lot of friends and are more socially active. WebMD finds that "" the happiness of an immediate social contact increased an individual's chances of becoming happy by 15%"" .... The happiness of a second-degree contact, such as the spouse of a friend, increases the likeliness of becoming happy by 10%, and the happiness of a third-degree contact -- or the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases the likelihood of becoming happy by 6%. "" (6) Pro case: I'll give some more arguments as I refute my opponent's. First he says that intelligent people do better academically than popular people. I don't deny this. But popular people, due to having more friends, will have more people they know to potentially cheat off of. They can easily ring up their bff and ask them what the answers are to the homework assignment. This also saves the popular person more effort because they don't necessarily have to study or work as much as an intelligent person to get good grades. Then he says that intelligent people are more likely to get a job they want. Turn - popularity is a much better avenue into an occupation. "" Sixty to 90 percent of jobs are found informally - mainly through friends, relatives, and direct contacts."" This means that people are more likely to get a job by knowing somebody and getting a referral than just being qualified for it. This gives the popular person another advantage since, by definition, they know a lot of people who can refer them. Finally, he says that popular people who aren't overly intelligent can't make it to college. Not true. The average ACT score is 21 (7). While most State colleges require a 24, most community colleges or other, lesser ones will accept less. But also, participation in band, sports, and what not are ways to get past a less-than-stellar academic record. And popular people are usually in these extra-curricular stuff because they had to have gotten popular somehow. So in short, popular people are empirically more happy than intelligent people, get jobs more easily, and can still get good grades and the college experience. Since we're looking to happiness as the framework for the debate, Pro needs to present a strong critique of the happiness argument to win.

(5)  Second, popularity correlates with more happiness. By definition, popular people have a lot of friends and are more socially active. WebMD finds that ""  the happiness of an immediate social contact increased an individual's chances of becoming happy by 15%""  ....  The happiness of a second-degree contact, such as the spouse of a friend, increases the likeliness of becoming happy by 10%, and the happiness of a third-degree contact -- or the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases the likelihood of becoming happy by 6%.  "" (6)  Pro case:  I'll give some more arguments as I refute my opponent's.  First he says that intelligent people do better academically than popular people. I don't deny this. But popular people, due to having more friends, will have more people they know to potentially cheat off of. They can easily ring up their bff and ask them what the answers are to the homework assignment. This also saves the popular person more effort because they don't necessarily have to study or work as much as an intelligent person to get good grades.   Then he says that intelligent people are more likely to get a job they want. Turn - popularity is a much better avenue into an occupation. ""  Sixty to 90 percent of jobs are found informally - mainly through friends, relatives, and direct contacts.""   This means that people are more likely to get a job by knowing somebody and getting a referral than just being qualified for it. This gives the popular person another advantage since, by definition, they know a lot of people who can refer them.  Finally, he says that popular people who aren't overly intelligent can't make it to college. Not true. The average ACT score is 21 (7). While most State colleges require a 24, most community colleges or other, lesser ones will accept less. But also, participation in band, sports, and what not are ways to get past a less-than-stellar academic record. And popular people are usually in these extra-curricular stuff because they had to have gotten popular somehow.  So in short, popular people are empirically more happy than intelligent people, get jobs more easily, and can still get good grades and the college experience. Since we're looking to happiness as the framework for the debate, Pro needs to present a strong critique of the happiness argument to win. I await his response.  1.   http://thecriticalthinker.wordpress.com...  2.   http://www.recurrentdepression.com...  3.   http://www.cmha.ca...  4.   http://www.gnxp.com...  5.   http://www.webmd.com...  6.   http://www.webmd.com...  7.   http://en.wikipedia.org...",Education,1,Intelligence-is-more-important-that-popularity/1/,19429

The government keeps their people hidden in the dark, if you do not comply with their orders, you are either killed in a gruesome way, or thrown in an inhumane prison. North Korea has a concentration camp known only as ""Camp 22."" Camp 22 was established in 1959. As of today, there are an estimated 50,000 prisoners held in Camp 22.

Reasons for housing the prisoners in this fashion are unclear, but could be to decrease the risk of rebellion. There have even been accounts of chemical experimentation on prisoners using a glass gas chamber for observation. This is just one of many prisons in North Korea. So many people are suffering at the hand of this horrible government. Now, if there was a nation that wished to stand up for what is right and take down North Korea's evil government would it be wrong? Would it be wrong to kill some people in North Korea's army in order to save its civilians? Of course not! Now, what about revolutions? In 1775, thirteen British colonies rebelled against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The thirteen colonies decided that they wanted freedom from Great Britain's rule. They wanted to be free from the over priced tax, and they also wanted freedom of religion. Britain was being overbearing and cruel to the colonies. The colonies started the war with Britain and won.

Well, FDR stated that the objective of the ND was to decrease unemployment. When the ND was finished, unemployment had dropped from when he enacted the ND. Therefore, the ND was successful based on how FDR defined success, which is what we are examining. If WWII dropped unemployment further, it is irrelevant because the ND had finished and unemployment had already seen substantial decrease. FDR did not define success as dropping the Unemployment to pre-Great Depression terms, but rather from 1933 terms, thus the ND was successful.

690,"As I feel all of pro's rebuttals fell through or will be addressed in my final conclusions, I will not address them directly at this moment. For my conclusion, I would like to defend the erroneous notion that I dropped the aforementioned arguments, and then directly address pro's reasons as to why he thinks he has made a better argument. 1. The round one arguments I supposedly dropped were the ideas that unknown dates would reduce time spent on emphasizing the test, and that a reduced focus on testing was good. First, I feel as though I was very clear about my view of time. I may not have put it in a big, bold heading, but I discussed even in my first post how review and repetition were vital keys to learning, and how this is well known to cognitive psychologists. All that talk we had about spaced versus massed presentation dealt with this issue of time. On the second issue, my opponent's argument was once again addressed. While his heading argues for a reduced focus on testing, his argument below that heading is actually focused on the issue of data dumping, which we discussed to death all throughout our debate. In his last section under the reduced testing section, my opponent comes back to mention the issue of reduced testing, which had nothing to do with his previous paragraph's formulation of the argument, and stated that we weren't really here to talk about whether reduced testing was good or bad. His emphasis was that data dumping was bad, and this was a result of the emphasis on testing. The data dumping was what inflates the test scores and offends my opponent, not the ""side issue"" of a focus on testing. 2. I did say that pro's system would make it harder to cram. But, I also emphasized that this was a short term and shortsighted solution. Cramming would still work if students timed their studying just right. If the strategy of cramming still worked, flashing lights should go off telling you the problem isn't resolved. The tests haven't changed, and higher level, long term thinking isn't being tested. While I would concede to pro that his solution would most likely help reduce grade inflation as a result of cramming, the problem pro is trying to solve is not grade inflation in general. He is bothered by the lack of knowledge retention and tests actually reflecting long term, in-depth understanding. His solution doesn't even come close to addressing this, since the assessments aren't changed at all. Pro's proposal throws the idea of Bloom's Taxonomy and universally accepted knowledge of higher level assessments out the window for a quick fix on paper. But reducing grade inflation on paper doesn't increase intellectual retention. Pro does try to save his system by saying that his will promote spaced presentation. However, pro is missing two key points. First, as mentioned above, he's not changing the assessment. Any exams taken will still only measure basic knowledge that is not reflective of long term understanding. Secondly, if pro is advocating spaced learning, he seems to agree that review and practicing for tests is a good thing, as spaced learning is an integral aspect of higher level examinations, not rote memory exams like he is putting forth. Or maybe pro is assuming these kids are going to go home and study every day. If he goes to a school where kids do that, sign me up to teach there. 3. I may be a bit idealistic, but that's the point of everything we do. When a mechanic fixes a car, his ideal goal is for it to work, and he's going to use the means he needs to make it work. As an educator, we know what works. Spaced learning, higher level thinking, goal orientation, and diverse assessments are vital to meaningful learning. Is every teacher going to teach appropriately and in align with these standards? Of course not. But what happens in the rest of the world when people know what to do to fulfill their jobs, and don't do it? Theoretically, they either get better or get fired. Not all teachers will teach correctly, and not all teachers will get caught teaching poorly. Some will suck for thirty years, until they retire. But I find it preposterous for pro to argue that I'm right about my ideals, but they're too good to be true. Things will never change if you don't hold people to standards and work to fix things, which is evident in pro's very proposal. He does not advocate solving much of anything, but seeks to minimize the damage of a broken system he aims to perpetuate. In conclusion, changing the assessment to test higher level thinking is the only way to ensure that you're actually testing for long-term, meaningful knowledge. Pro's system doesn't test for the knowledge he desires. And where meaningful assessment exists, common themes of spaced presentation, known goals, and diversity are present. You just don't see that in the monochromatic assessments and teaching that revolve around current, multiple-choice, memory based assessments. Once again, I appreciate pro's desire to train youth so they have meaningful knowledge. I respectfully disagree with his solution, but I admire his vision.",1,bjrscj,"

Although the provided definition of the word progress is one recognized definition of the word ""progress,"" there are are other definitions of the word that do not apply in all of the contexts supplied by Pro's argument. DEFINITION: prog*ress [ n. prog -res, -r uh s or, esp. British, proh -gres; v. pr uh - gres ] noun : activity in science, technology, etc., especially with reference to the commercial opportunities created thereby or to the promotion of the material well-being of the public through the goods, techniques, or facilities created. [1] For a more encyclopaedic perspective on the word progress, let's take a look at Wikipedia: In historiography and the philosophy of science, progress (from Latin progressus, ""an advance"") is the idea that the world can become increasingly better in terms of science, technology, modernization, liberty, democracy, quality of life, etc. [2] In the context of politics, this definition of the word is the definition that generally applies. Typically, but not quite exclusively, the application of the word ""progress"" is used to invoke left-of-center politics. However, the notion of progress as a social or technological evolution of humanity is clearly antithetical to some portions of the extreme right-wing: some religious groups would refute any value placed on progress or human self-determination, some nationalist extremists would oppose progress in any global context, some racial supremacists would exclude some human populations from any franchise of improvement, etc. Certainly, since Teddy Roosevelt, ""progress"" used as the stem word of Progressive politics or Progressive movements is decidedly left-of-center in political orientation. In 21st century American politics, an organization that places the word ""progress"" in its name is defining itself on the left as pronouncedly as an organization with ""family values"" in its name is defining itself on the right. The political orientation of the Vermont Progressive Party, the Congressional Progressive Caucus, or the Center for American Progress is declared by simply invoking progress in the name. I should say that I am confining this argument to American politics, seeing that Pro begins by refuting the American Left's usage of the word. Left-Wing ideology, stemming as it does from the division of the French Estate General, is here defined as support for social equality. [3] Conversely, Right-Wing ideology is defined as support for social hierarchy or social inequality. [4] In so far as the political definition of the word ""progress"" always implies increased democratization and self-improvement on a national or global scale, the word is generally exclusive of Right-Wing ideology. So, while abortion rights might be considered tangentially progressive in the extension of a civil right, Obamacare is a more classic representation of an expanded franchise and so progressive legislation. Gun ownership as a right was originally a progressive cause, expanding the franchise of self-defense to every class of people. Gun control today may also be defined as progressive, in as much as the implementation of regulations regarding registration, training, accountability represent organizational improvements. In these contexts, all definitions of the word ""progress"" are relevant. A resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, on the other hand, would represent a return to a traditional, less scientific political model. Although it might represent the attainment of some organization's goal, resegregation would not mean ""progress"" by every definition of the word. Likewise, the continuation of many Islamic traditions, while potentially an attainable goal, would not qualify as ""progress"" in the sense of human advancement. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

In these contexts, all definitions of the word ""progress"" are relevant.  A resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan, on the other hand, would represent a return to a traditional, less scientific political model. Although it might represent the attainment of some organization's goal, resegregation would not mean ""progress"" by every definition of the word. Likewise, the continuation of many Islamic traditions, while potentially an attainable goal, would not qualify as ""progress"" in the sense of human advancement.

It would appear as if we are actually making some headway. ::Case Pro- Rebuttals:: Contention 1: Delegalizing marriage has many positive effects such as: ""1. Government can no longer discriminate who can and can't get married."" Abolishing all legal forms of marriage to end certain forms of discrimination is completely nonsensical. It would be like cutting off your entire leg to get rid of a pain in your foot. ""2. People have more liberty to do what they want with certain rights."" I don't seem to understand what you are saying. If people can't get married then they would have less liberty, not more. ""3. All people would have equal rights, with no discriminatory benefits for those who people are willing to marry."" Giving all people equal treatment, regardless of circumstances, is itself a form of discrimination. Some people deserve more than others by virtue of their status/achievements in a society. Like I have said earlier, married couples deserve more rights than single people because they have many responsibilities that do not pertain to being single. Furthermore, even though some married people choose not to have children there are other responsibilities which only pertain to two people in a relationship that do not apply to single people. Among these responsibilities include decisions that need to be made about end of life issues. If you are single then you are not legally responsible for the end of life issues of anyone apart from yourself. This is why it's ridiculous to argue that legally sanctioned marriages violate the fourteenth amendment to the constitution. ::Case Pro- Counter Rebuttals:: Contention 1: Discrimination between married and single people is justified. Unfortunately, Mongeese has created a rather lengthy and irrelevant argument in this section. The fact that some people have a hard time getting married is utterly unrelated to this debate. People do not have a constitutional right to be guaranteed a marriage partner. Moreover, if people want to get married just to receive certain benefits then that's their prerogative. It is not the government's responsibility to investigate whether or not married people actually love each other. Contention 2: Legally sanctioned marriages are good for couples. ""The rights mentioned by my opponent should not be reserved to those who claim to be married, but to everybody."" The rights accorded to marriage are open to everyone else, and thus, your argument is irrelevant. Certain rights just have to be sought out individually. Furthermore, your proposed method for people getting married, and presumably divorced, would very likely lead to societal dysfunction. If getting married were ""as easy as pie"" then marriage would significantly lose its value in our modern industrialized society. It is a basic fact of human psychology that people are more likely to back out of things if there is no social pressure guiding their decisions. Therefore, government sanctioned marriages are likely to be cohesive since they are intertwined with legal social contracts in a way that Internet ""marriages"" are not. In conclusion, these quick and easy marriages would inevitably undermine various social contracts and degrade our sense of moral commitment. [1] Consider the following thought experiment. Imagine that a friend has invited you to a party where it doesn't really matter whether or not you show up. And then imagine that the president has invited you to speak at a white house dinner where you are the guest of honor. Which of these two events would you be more likely to back out of? Obviously, you would be less likely to stand up the president because by doing so you would endure many negative social repercussions. So to is the case with legally sanctioned marriages. If people could just get ""married"" by going to some website then divorce would almost certainly increase. This would then foster societal dysfunction. [2] Marriages are done in churches and often at courthouses because this increases the likelihood that those marriages will not dissolve in a quick divorce. This also forces people to think at least twice about their decisions regarding marriage. Your argument in favor of legally unrecognized quick and easy marriages through the Internet is not only poor; it is very likely to lead to impulsive marriage decisions that would surely be detrimental to society. Contention 3: Marriage is good for society and should be promoted by the government. Mongeese, you seem to have misunderstood my argument. I do not argue that legal marriages are more stable than non-legal marriages. I simply point out that marriage, whether legally recognized or not, is in general good for society. And in order to encourage marriage the government would be wise to legally recognize it and subsidize it with benefits. Secondly, marriages are stabilizing aspects of society even if children are not involved. Contention 4: Laws or legal arrangements that produce maximal utility should be preferred in a society. ""The positive benefits my opponent mentions would produce more utility if they were available to everybody regardless of marriage."" This has already been dealt with in one of my earlier segments. Hopefully, we can reach some kind of a consensus by the end of this debate. And I look forward to your final round. ::References:: 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>...",1,Freeman,"

If meat consumption was significantly reduced, the laws of capitalism would require production to fall also. No company is going to keep making the same amount of meat if their customers are now spending half as much money and there are half as many of them. Therefore, a drop in consumption would result in a drop in production, therefore supporting my resolution. To defend my points on the nutritive value of meat and the inefficiencies of its production I will say this. When we have millions and millions of people starving to death every year and the only thing we had to do to stop it was significantly reduce our meat consumption and transport all the grain that would have otherwise been wasted on meat production over to those people, then that is reason enough to significantly reduce meat production. Then my opponent says that if production was reduced but consumption wasn't reduced there would be problems. This is an incoherent statement. Production can't reduce below the rate of previous consumption while consumption stays the same. That's like saying a person who usually eats 3 eggs a day suddenly finds out there are no eggs left in the world, but he somehow still eats 3 eggs. I agree that a decrease in production would increase DEMAND. This is where you must decide what is worse, millions of starving and dying people, or high meat prices and some people out of jobs. I think my opponent is mistaking a reduced amount of meat with no meat at all. I agree, we need some meat to get our daily amounts of key nutrients that meat provides. However, most middle class Americans get more than enough of these nutrients and could survive with a drop in meat consumption. Poor people already can't afford meat such as steak so it won't affect them. Vegetarians manage to get all their nutrients through alternative routes such as peanut butter etc. We can manage, plus we will still have some meat, just not as much. Now I must point out that my opponent has offered almost no argument against the environmental detriments of meat production. He has simply suggested we need better business practices. What business practice would get rid of all the CO2 and methane cows and other ranch animals make each year. Large-scale Filters are impractical. Therefore, my point stands un-refuted.",1,zach12,"
  
Once again, thank you Lexicaholic  
  
My opponent contends that meat consumption, not production, should be reduced. He is misunderstanding something however. If meat consumption was significantly reduced, the laws of capitalism would require production to fall also. No company is going to keep making the same amount of meat if their customers are now spending half as much money and there are half as many of them. Therefore, a drop in consumption would result in a drop in production, therefore supporting my resolution.

As I've already shown, he is literally faster than a bullet as we clearly saw him webbing up bullets AFTER they were fired. What's more, he pulled this off with his goal being to protect someone OTHER than himself. My opponent has given us no reason to believe that Batman can move at a similar speed, much less move fast enough to avoid being clobbered by Spider-Man the very INSTANT the battle begins (i.e. a speed blitz). Batman won't even have the opportunity to CONSIDER using gadgets. 2) Even while shrunken down to the size of an action figure, we saw Spider-man EASILY knocking out trained soldiers who were normal in size. Again, imagine how one of these punches would effect Batman when up against the wall crawler at normal size. ONE punch is all it takes to put Batman down for the count. As of now, you could probably stop reading and just vote CON since there's pretty much no way Batman is getting around someone who is too fast/strong for him without any kind of prior knowledge of the battle or his opponent. 3) Spider-Man has his own unique fighting style which has enabled him to have fighting skills superior to most of the fighters in the Marvel Universe. Not to mention that Spider-Man has trained under Captain America as well (who is regarded as the best fighter in the Marvel Universe). Even if the two were close in strength and speed, Batman would not have his martial arts skills as an advantage. 4) One of the most intelligent people in the Marvel Universe (Hank Pym) claims that Spider-Man was smarter than him merely at the age of 15 (when he invented his spider tracers). Spider-Man is much older now and more experienced. When taking into consideration his own share of intellectual feats, he can at very LEAST a match against Batman. Thus, intelligence won't be an advantage either. 5) I've shown that the foes who my opponent has claimed to be superior to Spider-Man to have either been beaten only after Batman had lost earlier (hence had time to prepare for the rematch) and/or that Spider-Man is superior and has bested foes even greater still on a regular basis. When taking all of the facts into consideration, the dark knight doesn't stand a CHANCE! Mr. Wayne would approach the battle with his usual overconfidence and tough guy demeanor, only to be quickly dispatched and webbed up against a lamp post as if he were some common crook.

713,"(INTRODUCTION) Thank you for your argument. I appreciate that you did not forfeit, as that is quite common these days. (REBUTTALS) These feats of Captain America are impressive but I believe that a lot of these feats take place in multiple universes, there is even one where he is Iron Man. I believe that using different information from separate universes is a little unfair, as it means in one universe Captain America could be stronger than another. I tried to find a resource that proves Cap once lifted a tree, but I found none. It is very unlikely that he would use Mjolnir against Master Chief, probably because Thor owns it and not Cap. Yes, Captain America is quite good at multiple martial arts but he does not know all of them, Even if he is a better hand-to-hand combatant that does not mean he would win. As for the speed, I again found no resource supporting your claims. Yes, he may have knocked out Namor (Who is NOT stronger than the hulk) But Namor was out of water, and was not at his peak. Also, Colossus is only 500 pounds, below Captain America's strength. Stalemating against Wolverine is not a surprise, as Wolverine is not as skilled as Captain America. I hope you get the point. ""And Captain America does have more experience: Cap was a prominent comic character in the 1940's that eventually lost popularity. But like I previously mentioned, be made his official comeback in 1964. Modern day (2014) to 1964 is 50 years of experience, and that's not counting his WWII years."" FALSE! What you said about the publication history of Captain America is true, however time in Earth 616 and time in our world is different. ""It is possible that 4 years of comics in our universe are the equivalent of 1 year in the Mainstream Marvel Universe , as it is revealed in 2013's Indestructible Hulk that the 2008's Skrull Secret Invasion happened one year ago in Earth-616.

  (INTRODUCTION)  
  
  Thank you for your argument. I appreciate that you did not forfeit, as that is quite common these days.  
  
  (REBUTTALS)  
  
  These feats of Captain America are impressive but I believe that a lot of these feats take place in multiple universes, there is even one where he is Iron Man. I believe that using different information from separate universes is a little unfair, as it means in one universe Captain America could be stronger than another.  
  
  I tried to find a resource that proves Cap once lifted a tree, but I found none. It is very unlikely that he would use Mjolnir against Master Chief, probably because Thor owns it and not Cap. Yes, Captain America is quite good at multiple martial arts but he does not know all of them, Even if he is a better hand-to-hand combatant that does not mean he would win. As for the speed, I again found no resource supporting your claims. Yes, he may have knocked out Namor (Who is NOT stronger than the hulk) But Namor was out of water, and was not at his peak. Also, Colossus is only 500 pounds, below Captain America’s strength. Stalemating against Wolverine is not a surprise, as Wolverine is not as skilled as Captain America. I hope you get the point.  
  
  “And Captain America does have more experience: Cap was a prominent comic character in the 1940's that eventually lost popularity. But like I previously mentioned, be made his official comeback in 1964. Modern day (2014) to 1964 is 50 years of experience, and that's not counting his WWII years.”  
  
  FALSE!  
  
  What you said about the publication history of Captain America is true, however time in Earth 616 and time in our world is different.  
  
  “It is possible that 4 years of comics in our universe are the equivalent of 1 year in the   Mainstream Marvel Universe  , as it is revealed in 2013's   Indestructible Hulk   that the 2008's   Skrull Secret Invasion   happened one year ago in Earth-616. This would mean that from 1961 (the debut of   Fantastic Four #1   and the beginning of the ""Age of Heroes"") to 2013, only 13 years have passed in the Earth-616.” {1}  
  
  There you have it. Captain America is younger than Master Chief, who was and still is training and has been for 40 years straight unlike Cap, who only started military training after the age of 21.. And as stated before, alternate realities, at least in my opinion do not count.  
  
  I hope everyone gets my point.  
  
  (FINAL ARGUMENTS)  
  
  I believe that Master Chiefs weapons which include various guns, grenades, laser swords, flame throwers and more plus Master Chief’s enhanced abilities are simply too much for the Winghead, and again, Cap has no particular defense to weapons. A quick list of Master Chief’s weapons is in order.  
  
  -M6 Grindell Non-Linear Rifle: One of the most if not the most powerful guns in Halo. It is extremely damaging to infantry and Captain America would probably be considered infantry. {2}  
  -M41 Rocket Launcher: While this beautiful piece of weaponry is primarily used to fight vehicles, if it can tear a 66 tonne Battle Tank into rubble, just imagine what it can do to one person.{3}  
  -Overshield: A defensive weapon, yet still useful. “  The Overshield technology is developed by the Covenant to enhance their   Sangheili   warriors'   personal shielding system  . The Overshield can be used by anyone utilizing a personal shielding system such as a   SPARTAN   in a   MJOLNIR armor   or   Sangheili   with a   combat harness  . “ {4}

717,"I'm not aware of any kind of ""artificial"" wellbeing as you have suggested, only simply, wellbeing. There are many paths up the mountain. Is it really that uncommon for your primary physician to ask, ""How have you been feeling?"" Or a therapist? Example: I have a broken leg. It's a basic fracture that doesn't require surgury or even need to be reset. A simple protective cast is ordered and I am prescribed and given pain medication, the opiate narcotic pain killer Vicodin. Now with the proper recommended dose the opiate in my blood stream goes straight to work blocking the pain receptors of my nervous system, thus preventing the pain chemicals in my body from being received; the ""feeling"" of the searing pain from a broken bone is NOT ""felt"" ... But another curious thing happens, by blocking pain receptors I also receive, as a side effect, feelings and waves of comfort: I am high.. Stoned.. Drugged up.. and it ""feels"" great! Most would say, ""Well, damn, he just broke his leg, of course, let him take the pain killers until the pain subsides.."" or ""Who cares if he is high or feels good, he has a broken leg.."" or ""I'm sure breaking a leg is stressful, hopefully the pain meds give him some relief and comfort.."" Now lets notice and explore a couple of ideas here in the example I have given: 1) The narcotic does nothing to actually repair the broken bone in my leg! The narcotic only merely ""tricks"" my body that I'm not in pain. 2) Because the drug makes me high, I feel good (despite my broken leg) yet the source (the opiate) is technically synthetic and artificial; least we say superficial as well.. YET, I STILL FEEL GOOD (which is the point). So now let's distinguish this and contrast this from your views. Sure, the Vicodin is acting directly with the chemistry of my body. But it produces feelings of wellbeing without addressing or curing and mending my broken leg. We could then get very medically and scientifically detailed about how the drug's material chemistry ""works"". But again, it still doesn't repair and mend the broken bone in my leg, yet it's a justified therapy given to one who has a broken leg. Further, we know of the healing odds of placebos. Medical therapies do not even have to have a direct chemical influence on the body to have a positive outcome, and produce wellbeing. The brain and mind of the body merely need to believe that it does, and a seemingly unscientific event occurs, the body follows and begins to heal itself. Major surgeries have been preformed without any chemical sedatives or anesthetics using only suggestive hypnosis! I don't know how useful it is to equate alternative medical therapies to Jesus, Bigfoot, UFOs, etc. I think that it might be a mistake to qualify all of these subjects equally in the same way. Your conclusion seems to be that homeopathic alternative therapies must meet certain scientific requirements and standards first before being taken seriously, otherwise they cannot possibly ""work"". I have shown that to be false. Perhaps the end result (how people feel) should be standard, as it is in all areas of medicine.",1,philosurfer,"

722,"Due to a family emergency, I don't have time to make a fully fleshed out argument but I will later. Let's look at some numbers first. After 1996, less than 10% of nonfatal violent crimes involved firearms. <URL>... . So criminals with guns are hardly an issue, as most just don't have guns, which in your society, they will. According to this <URL>... , people with severe mental illness are responsible for less than one in 20 violent crimes. So those other nineteen people with a ""sound"" mind, you'll be arming them. And here's my favorite <URL>... Just a couple points from that last article: When it comes to violence, nearly every figure suggests that increased presence of guns correlates with higher levels of injury and death. Homicide rates among the US population between 15 and 24 years of age are 14 times higher than those in most other industrialized nations. Children from 5 to 14 years old are 11 times more likely to be killed in an accidental shooting. Within the US, areas with high gun ownership have higher rates of these problems. And, for every accidental death, Hemenway cites research that indicates 10 more incidents are sufficient to send someone to the emergency room. Suicides are more likely to be successful when guns areinvolved , even though most people who survive such an attempt don't generally try a second time. people regularly get involved in violence, and the presence of a gun is likely to elevate that to fatal levels. This is especially true for women. In a study of three metropolitan counties that is cited by the review, ""Most of the women were murdered by a spouse, a lover, or a close relative, and the increased risk for homicide from having a gun in the home was attributable to these homicides."" In the case of battered women, lethal assaults were 2.7 times more likely to occur if a gun was present in the house;no protective effect of the gun was found."" Summing matters up, Hemenway notes that a number of surveys have found that a gun kept at home is far more likely to be used in violence, an accident, or a suicide attempt than self defense. (He also goes off on a long diversion about how a poorly trained gun owner is unlikely to use one well even when self defense is involved.) As a result, from a public health perspective, there's little doubt that a gun at home is generally a negative risk factor. I look forward to my opponents arguments.",1,MarquisX,"
  
Due to a family emergency, I don't have time to make a fully fleshed out argument but I will later.  
  
Let's look at some numbers first.  
  
After 1996, less than 10% of nonfatal violent crimes involved firearms.   http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov...  . So criminals with guns are hardly an issue, as most just don't have guns, which in your society, they will.  
  
According to this   http://karisable.com...  , people with severe mental illness are responsible for less than one in 20 violent crimes. So those other nineteen people with a ""sound"" mind, you'll be arming them.  
  
And here's my favorite   http://arstechnica.com...  
  
Just a couple points from that last article:  
  
When it comes to violence, nearly every figure suggests that increased presence of guns correlates with higher levels of injury and death. Homicide rates among the US population between 15 and 24 years of age are 14 times higher than those in most other industrialized nations. Children from 5 to 14 years old are 11 times more likely to be killed in an accidental shooting. Within the US, areas with high gun ownership have higher rates of these problems. And, for every accidental death, Hemenway cites research that indicates 10 more incidents are sufficient to send someone to the emergency room. Suicides are more likely to be successful when guns areinvolved , even though most people who survive such an attempt don't generally try a second time.  
  
people regularly get involved in violence, and the presence of a gun is likely to elevate that to fatal levels. This is especially true for women. In a study of three metropolitan counties that is cited by the review, ""Most of the women were murdered by a spouse, a lover, or a close relative, and the increased risk for homicide from having a gun in the home was attributable to these homicides."" In the case of battered women, lethal assaults were 2.7 times more likely to occur if a gun was present in the house;no protective effect of the gun was found.""  
  
Summing matters up, Hemenway notes that a number of surveys have found that a gun kept at home is far more likely to be used in violence, an accident, or a suicide attempt than self defense. (He also goes off on a long diversion about how a poorly trained gun owner is unlikely to use one well even when self defense is involved.) As a result, from a public health perspective, there's little doubt that a gun at home is generally a negative risk factor.

723,"I thank Pro for this short and fun debate. If we ever meet on the piste I will ensure that he leaves it looking like a Christmas tree *evil laugh*. Summary & Defence of Positive Case C1. Defining a ""flick"" is subjective Note that he photo I provided is an extreme flick example, the vast majority of flicks are nowhere near this obvious. Furthermore, it was never my contention that all flicks were unrulable, only that what defines a flick is subjective. Pro appeals to the point-in-line being the arbiter, but ignores that the videos of foil fencers, fencing regularly with no flicks, makes such a position untenable, since even a ""point-in-line"" has a tonne of flexing and bending of the blades which makes naive judgements impossible. Furthermore, Pro drops my arguments that a referee judging more marginal cases is going to have a much harder time, and that it would inevitably lead to many unfair referee calls (and in fencing, not making a call is just as harmful as making a call, since not making a call indirectly penalises the opposing foilist) in an already stressful and sensitive environment. Pro between the lines concedes that there is a large level of subjectivity in determining what a disqualifiable ""flick"" is - which is enough to establish this contention. Voters need only weigh the impacts here. C2. Increases refereeing difficulty Con's rebuttal here ignores the context and bulk of my argument on the number of factors that a fencing referee already has to deal with. Con never contests here that adding this ruling would increase refereeing difficulty (which was the point of my contention) - he has only disputed its impact. We already have problematic capacity for errors in judging to adversely impact the result of a duel - so why should we make a problem (which Con has not contested exists) worse> C3. Flicks have a high skill barrier to be effective Con has dropped my arguments that prohibiting flicking would remove a valuable part of a high-level foilist's repertoire - which is already an impact by itself. If we banned the backhand slice from the game of tennis, then I don't think it takes much argument that this negatively impacts the game from a technical and spectator's point of view. Con brings up the issue of safety, which I had already addressed with data in my previous round as unfounded. Empirical facts trump theory and speculation. There are more technical reasons why injuries from flicks are unlikely, but I can no longer present new material. Please note that the data I presented both encompasses injuries in practice (which constitutes nearly 3/4 of all fencing injuries) and fencing in tournaments. Thus his arguments against injuries in practice (in order to flick more effectively) must directly contend with this. C4. Flicks are a solved problem Con drops my points that the change in fencing timings essentially solved the problem of flicking (which was not a problem for the reasons Con posits). The fact that something is a problem doesn't mean that the something needs to be eliminated. Summary of Rebuttals & Negative Case R1. Safety While I understand that Con could not present new material to counter my rebuttals here, I will extend my previous rebuttals. They factually disprove Con's position on safety. Given that this is Con's only real substantive contention, then without this Con's case falls apart. Furthermore, one must also consider the knock-on effects of assuming back-of-the-head safety as a sufficient cause for prohibiting the flick, since other traditional fencing moves have a risk of in theory causing the same injury, or worse (since flicks can virtually never cause a fatal injury via. broken blade). R2 & 3. Right of Way &Out of Time I feel I have sufficiently demonstrated that these contentions do not actually demonstrate what is required to fulfil the resolution. One could fully accept both these contentions but only be left with affirming that the rules need to be changed on the right-of-way regarding flicks, but not on prohibiting them altogether as valid touches. These contentions can be disregarded. R4. Nuts & Bolts (Spirit of the Game) Even if one fully accepts this contention - it is very low impact - since the spirit of the game I have already argued is plastic, and divorced from idealism, and has changed significantly over time. Also I have argued that the original spirit of the game is factually false due to observations in epee (the only fencing weapon I had hardly fenced myself, for these exact reasons). Fencing is no longer about running your opponent through. Thus, this at best only provide a weak-impact arhument which clearly introducing referee bias, problems, and difficulty is not going to stand. R5. Anecdote The impacts of his anecdote need to be weighed against the alternatives. Pain from flicking is not exclusive to flicking, it is inherent to any fencing move done incorrectly (or even correctly, as my own anecdote attests). I have shown a double standard in Con's anecdote as a result, since several acceptable actions now which indeed could have serious fatal consequences are not chastised. Thus, his anecdote is on dubious grounds. Overview While Con did have some important impacts to consider regarding safety, I have sufficiently shown these can be disregarded on a factual level. The next most important impacts I argue are whether or not it is fairly implementable, and I have sufficiently demonstrated this is not the case. Because my impacts outweigh's Con's impacts, even if Con's contentions were valid and sound, voters ought to vote for Pro. I thank Con for a very fun (and bankrupting) debate!",1,Envisage,"

Alright I'll cut the BS and get to some truth. Truth 1: If your mother is a slut and your sisters a stripper than obviously she must have very poor parenting skills, I mean just look how you turned out. She raised a cock buffing flamboyant gaynard who thinks parading around shirtless in rainbow colored paint is the coolest thing next to polar bear vagina. That's not even mentioning the fact that you've confessed to shoving inanimate objects up your rectum since a very young age. You obviously seem very psychologically disturbed, but you know what it's not your fault, I blame your whorish mother. Given your environmental factors I think its safe to say you being a welfare recipient is far more logically plausible than me. Truth 2: You're 18 years old, wtf do you know about working? You might of held down a sh**ty part-time taco bell job or something, but you have no idea of what it's actually like living outside the confines of your mothers tits, where shes not there to wipe your abused gaping a$$hole, or spoon feed you at the dinner room kitchen table on top of your high chair.

You have no idea of what it actually means to work and your only accolades you have are a f****ng asvab test and a couple of useless merits on your retarded JROTC uniform that your corny brainwashed a$$ seems to be so proud of.

The former is a shadow of the latter. What happens physically in the first happens Spiritually in the second. We cannot know, or show mercy unless we understand what justice is first. RESOLVED.  
*******************************************************************************  
2 Pet 2:7-8 - Gen 19:8  
  
But God did NOT allow any such thing to happen to Lot's daughters. If the Bible taught or 'upheld' gang rape surely God would have allowed it to prove His point? RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
Psa 19:7 - Heb 8:7-8  
  
But as the scripture I've already provided clearly shows, THE BIBLE clearly teaches that the law failed because of imperfect men. *Voters please note that my opponent has yet again resorted to arguing his own opinion rather than comparing the Bible with ITSELF. RESOLVED. (round1)  
********************************************************************************  
Psa 103:8 - Exo 34:6 - Jer 13:14 - Lam 3:43b - 1 Sam 15:2 - 1 Sam 6:19  
  
Now you are simply imposing your own judgment on WHEN God should finally lose His temper. You are treating an absolute, objective Entity by your subjective standards of 'slow to anger' etc.  
RE~SOLVED!  
********************************************************************************  
Heb 13:20a - 2 The 3:16 - Rom 15:33 - Exo 15:3 - Psa 18:34 - Psa 144:1  
  
Now you have switched from arguing whether the Bible is contradictory to arguing whether GOD is contradictory. The Bible could actually state 'God is contradictory' and in NO way be contradictory ITSELF. RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
GE 6:4 - FACT  
  
But in your OPINION miraculous healings and seas parting and resurrections are contradictory to reality. They are not according to the BIBLE. *Voters please note that my opponent has abandoned the agreed arena of debate for his own opinion and conjecture. RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
Gen 7:19 - FACT  
  
We are NOT arguing whether the Bible contradicts reality but whether it contradicts ITSELF.  
RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
GEN 7:2 - GEN 7:8 - GEN 7:9 - FACT  
  
NO. If the Bible stated that the earths circumference were 4 miles and then 80s miles then THAT would be a contradiction within the agreed confines of this debate. RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
LEV 11:6 - FACT  
  
No, it is not poop. Although it is expelled anally it is totally different from normal poop. They re-chew the food in just the same way, which end is unimportant, only that it is an unclean animal. RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
GEN 3:14 - FACT  
  
It is both. Asking me to state 'which parts are which' is a cynical attempt to portray discernment as a haphazard affair, where as in reality the Bible is easily understood by children. RESOLVED.  
********************************************************************************  
GEN 1:29 - FACT  
  
AGAIN, I have already provided scripture to show that the Bible clearly teaches that the 'fall' effected all of creation, not just man. RESOLVED. (round 1)  
********************************************************************************  
Gen 7:6 - FACT  
  
""Before Biblical times"" This statement typifies my opponents confusion over the parameters of the debate. How can there possibly be 'before Biblical times' if we are debating whether the Bible is consistent with itself?  
********************************************************************************  
  
My opponent relies on a 'superior attitude' rather than valid responses or reasoned debate. (when he understands the debate that is.)  
  
""The proposition on offer is that the Bible is an inconsistent document, historically, scientifically, and logically (with itself). "" NOT with 'facts' NOT with your opinion. With ITSELF.

727,"I would like to begin this round by thanking my opponent for their willingness to compete in this debate. I would also like to extend thanks towards those individuals who take time to read and vote on it. Now, without any further ado let's jump right it. Resolved: Governments do not have moral obligations to assist nations in need Definitions~ Government: a political entity acknowledged by the majority of the citizenry as the governing body. Moral Obligation~ A duty to act based off one's beliefs Assist~ Active contribution towards the fulfillment of a need Need~ A situation in which something is required I present the VALUE or highest goal of this round as National Sovereignty defined as ""The power of a state to be free from external control"" . If a country cannot have sovereignty, it shall not have independence. If a foreign power can tell America ""what we shall do, and what we shall not do,"" George Washington once wrote to Alexander Hamilton, ""we have Independence yet to seek, and have contended hitherto for very little"" Argument #1: Government is an Amoral Entity Government, while being run by people, is not a person itself. Thus, the entity of government is a tool which cannot be held accountable for its actions. To better explain this concept let's take the example of a car accident involving a drunk driver. Suppose after consuming one too many at his friend's party, Tommy gets into his car to drive home. On the way, he looses control and his Car hits a pedestrian. The individual dies and an investigation ensues. In the end, who will be held accountable for this needless death? Tommy or the Car? Even though the Car was the actual means by which the individual died it was the actions and conscious choices of Tommy that brought about the accident. Therefore Tommy is the guilty one. In a similar way, the entire entity of government cannot be indicted for an action However, the leaders and those in power of a government can. During the Watergate Scandal, did we impeach our government for immoral actions? No, we impeached the perpetrator of those actions, President Nixon. Therefore, while government may have obligations, they are not based on any particular form of moral system. Argument #2: Preserving National Sovereignty IS Government's Obligation Government exists as a lubricant to operate society in an organized and efficient manner, to protect the citizens from dangers without, through the use of a military, and also to provide protection from dangers within, (police, etc...). By very nature, government is only obligated to exercise power only within its own borders, attempts to do otherwise have historically resulted in war, genocide, revolution, and international turmoil. This does not mean that governments do not engage in diplomacy but rather that the diplomacy is conducted solely for the good of the country, and that an obligation to assist outside of the diplomatic realm does not exist. Argument #3 Mandating Foreign Aid Violates National Sovereignty ""An Atlas, whose back is bowed and whose hands are busy holding up the world, has no arms to lift to deal with his own defense. Increase his burdens and you will crush him...This is our present posture"" ~ U.S. political theorist, Murray Rothbard Government's sole focus ought to be within its own borders and we cannot violate this ""National Sovereignty"" by obligating a government to assist every time a separate nation has a need. By forcing a government to provide aid to EVERY SINGLE needy nation this resolution infringes upon state's ability to decide where their foreign aid would go and how it could best benefit their allies or national interests. Not only does this defy the bounds of the national sovereignty of nations assisting but also damages the sovereignty of the nation being assisted as, under this resolution, aid could be forcibly given even where it is not desired. At best, the affirmation of this resolution will compromise the stability, economic security, and welfare of the citizens under the assisting government. At worst it has the potential consequence of social disruption and violent unrest in the nation receiving the aid. An example of this actually taking place would be the Rwandan Genocide of 1994. After World War 1, the League of Nations placed Rwanda under the control of the European country of Belgium. They felt that this would be the best policy to help the Rwandans overcome their perpetual civil violence stemming from tribe rivalry between the dominate Hutu and the historical underdog the Tutsi's. According to BBC NEWS~ ""The Belgians considered the Tutsi to be intellectually superior to the Hutu's and put them in leadership positions over the Hutu's. Not surprisingly, the Tutsi welcomed this idea, and for the next 20 years they enjoyed better jobs and educational opportunities than their neighbors. The Hutu's of course responded in violence and discontentment. This disruption of the original social structure is a plausible reason for why these feelings of resentment eventually boiled over."" In 1994, the Rwandan Genocide caused the deaths of an estimated 800,000 people. The violation of national sovereignty is truly devastating! In Conclusion then, we have seen that not only is government an amoral entity, but also that its sovereignty cannot be threatened by mandating foreign aid as an obligation.

734,"Technically pop music was supposed to have originated in the 1890s; however, for the purpose of this debate I will accept the common notion that, ""The origins of pop music can be traced to post-Second World War in the United States, where a succession of events made commercial sound recordings accessible to the population at large for the first time"" (Wikipedia: Pop Music). Thus famous pop musicians and groups include Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, Madonna and Michael Jackson, whom are affectionately referred to as the ""King and Queen"" of Pop. Although these two artists in particular had reached the peak of their music careers in the 1980s, I argue that the trimpuhs made by these two individuals do not and can not undermine the effect that pop music and other pop artists have made on the world in decades prior. Elvis is called the ""King of Rock-N-Roll"" yet he is also considered a part of the pop music genre (countless sites support this notion; I will provide citation if necessary). His impact on the music industry is undeniable. His style, song-writing and performance style has been imitated and inspirational for artists of every genre years after his success and death. Similarly, The Beatles have impacted music in a big way, intoducing the world to a lot of ""firsts"" such as being the first band ever to have all positions in the top ten be filled with their songs at one time, the first band to have over 50,000 fans attend a concert, the first band to create music videos (called ""promotional films"")... I could go on and on and on. The contributions to the industry and other aspects of pop culture in general (fashion trends, hair styles, new recording methods, new genre - see: acid rock, etc etc etc) are insurmountable attributes given to us by The Beatles. Because of this group and other pop artists, such as Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys to name a few, I would consider the 1960s to be the decade with the ""best"" pop music. The Beach Boys were the typical All-American guy group that won the hearts of adoring female fans with catchy tunes, and ""Dylan's early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture"" (Wikipedia: Bob Dylan). However I will not negate the impact of artists from different decades; in truth I am simply selecting the 1960s as the decade with the ""best"" pop music because in a previous debate it was advised I select a basis for comparison when it comes to this type of debate with said topic. In that case, I would like to state that the 1960s surpasses the 1980s as the decade with the ""best"" pop music for a few reasons: the impact of the artists, the popularity of the music, the influence these musicians have had on society and future music, the catchy melodies and beats, etc. My opponent has noted that he feels the pop music of the 1980s was the best because there are less profanities. I would like to point out that there were little to no profanities in pop music prior to the 1970s at best. There were some profanities in 1980s pop music as well. Additionally, Pro has suggested that pop music today consists of strictly computer beats with little input from musicians. I would like to remind him that the 1980s was the decade of synthesizers; although artists have used them before the 80s, they became extremely popular and were the backbone of a majority of the pop music acts during that decade.",1,Danielle,"

I would like to remind him that the 1980s was the decade of synthesizers; although artists have used them before the 80s, they became extremely popular and were the backbone of a majority of the pop music acts during that decade.",Entertainment,0,the-1980-s-pop-music-is-best-2/1/,54428

This seems normal but most countries around the world have 200 days of school. Now we may think this is not that much of a difference but for the slow students this gives teachers extra time to help them, if I could have twenty extra days to practice math in school with a teachers help who knows how much better I would be. This is not even counting on the Asian system where they have maybe 240 or more days of school. Let's keep this round only talking about 200 days though, we will get into more later, if the challenger can help it. Let's start with European countries such as France. They run from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m and have a half a day on Saturday. Is this truly bad? It may get in the way of early morning sports here in America but we can easily get around it, and some people don't even get up until 12 p.m.(say some because some are early birds). I don't think most people would get up early to see a friend here in America since most boys are playing video games late into the night and girls may have some late night parties, sleepovers or as it is here in my area talking on facebook all night. Now this isn't everyone but may be a good enough majority to stop the Saturday school day. I for one would love to get up on Saturday and go to school. It will help me be productive and I would be able to go directly to a friends house on the bus instead of going home and asking my parent or his parents to give me a ride to his place. I think this would get some people on board with this idea. See in Europe they have it divided into sections of 7 week periods. So 7 weeks of 5 and a half days of school, with one or two weeks vacation in between them. So it is basically Christmas Vacation in every single quarter of our school years. Any one who hates this idea I say would just want to stay home instead of going. I would love this to be in America. It is efficient and gives us a break instead of having one day off here and there. I shall go onto Russia, they are just like us but instead of just quitting school like a small to medium percentage of students from a school may do, they have 10th grade ending mandatory school but have a great alternative. They allow you to study trade skills or even study to get into a university. This is also a great alternative for America. It may not extend our years at school but with the studying trade skills or even to get into a university is great. It helps students who went out of school to prepare for life instead of going back and getting a GED, for those who don't want to go to a university the trade skills help them get a job instead of working at Burger King their entire lives! Now for schools who have the exact same curriculum as us, such as Spain. They have almost the exact rules for school as us, go from kindergarten until your 16 then you can quit, but instead of the kids doing nothing with their 2 months of extra time in the summer they almost have to go to a summer camp whether it be for sports or practicing their English skills, but if this was in America is wouldn't be for speaking English. I have a small school that only offers German and Spanish languages. I would love to go to camp in the summer to learn Japanese, Mandarin, or French.

Since he had two rounds to name his Homo Floro and hasn't named it yet, it falls on me to name it. Now, my opponent does not want to be held liable for Kanye's actions as evidenced by his statement: ""Now, if this horny Homo was brought before the courts and successfully prosecuted for rape, the family could then sue me for supplying them with a paedophile pet."" My opponent also does not want Kanye to be held responsible for his own actions as my opponent feels that Kanye can't defend himself and cannot be held liable for his own actions. My opponent also agrees that there ought to responsibility for a Homo Floro's actions with this statement: "" There ought to be accountability for Homos' actions, I agree, but the Homos themselves should not be held legally liable ."" My question then is: Who will be held liable for Kanye's actions? Not my oppoent, not Kanye and certainly not the victims. If Kanye is not prosecuted, we will have rampant rape of human girls and a new hybrid species will emerge. Note that rape will occur not due to mistaken identity but due to Homo Floros like Kanye intentionally raping human girls. To stop this, all Homo Floros must be prosecuted before a human judge. 2) Homo Floros can defend themselves very well My opponent tells an interesting story about a French monkey which was accused of being a French spy and hanged. This analogy is inadequate for two reasons: (a) Homo Floros are far more intelligent than monkeys. My opponent's source says that Homo Floros are extremely intelligent. ""Given that Homo floresiensis is the smallest human species ever discovered, they out-punch every known human intellectually, pound for pound""[3]. How dare my opponent compare it to a monkey?? (b) The English would most certainly have hanged a human French spy. The hanging took place not because the spy was a monkey, but because he was French. So this is not an analogous situation to Kanye being prosecuted. The monkey in my opponent's example was treated like a human, so too will Kanye. 3) Mistaken Identity "" You see! Even my opponent couldn't tell the difference between an adult Homo female and an adolescent human female, so what chance would a male Homo have? "" I have no idea where in the world my opponent gets that from, since I never commented on his pictures. However, open these two pictures, [1] <URL>... ;[2] <URL>... if you can tell that [1] was a Homo Floro and [2] was a human girl, I will have won this point. Even if an exceptionally stupid Homo Floro mistakes a human girl for one of its own, it must still be prosecuted as it committed a crime against a human being and violated human laws. It doesn't matter whether or not it knew that it was breaking the law. Conclusion When a Homo Floro rapes an underage girl, he knows that it is a human girl.

I shall make this debate as simple as possible (due to being in a hurry) by negating the resolution in two ways: 1) NUDITY OUGHT NOT TO BE A CONSIDERATION WHEN RATING A FILM Ladies and gentleman, our ways of life are in need of some serious change. Exactly what is the problem with nudity? What problem is there with features we all have? What is the point to hiding these features when it comes to the silver screen? Why should we be ashamed of our bodies? We seem perfectly fine with allowing mere students to explore the human body at their own whim in health and science classes, via textbook pictures. Other countries seem fine with allowing mere nudity on screen even in innocent children's cartoons. Clearly, our culture needs to progress and stop considering nudity as a factor in the film rating system. Otherwise, I challenge my opponent to point out the problems with mere nudity being presented on screen. Though be warned: If he presents any problems which have been instigated due to our mere repression of onscreen, he shall only be fueling my argument. 2) EXTREME VIOLENCE ALONE OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH TO GIVE A FILM AN R RATING On the other, extreme violence is a different matter. When I think of extreme violence, I think of small children being skewered/mutilated graphically, human beings slowly having their skin ripped off their body and all other gruesome acts that may leave an impressionable image on a weaker mind (which, typically, is the mind of a non adult); acts that a younger mind may not be prepared to handle. Additional support for my claims can be found here: <URL>... Thus, for a brief overview of this round, I'm positing that nudity alone no longer be considered a factor based on the fact that it produces real harmful effects (not to mention that we seem to have already given our children access to it (in the form of textbooks) and that extreme violence alone should be enough for a film to earn an R rating based on the fact that it alone can leave impressionable images on those who do not have a developed mind.

We have already established that the eternal torment of Hell is an unjust and immoral punishment for all mortal souls to be judged ""deserving"" of. Therefore, every time a soul is unjustly sent to Hell, it counts as another immoral act toward one being's ever-growing criminal record: the greatest criminal mastermind in history, the one responsible for the creation and continuation of the draconian cruelty and injustice that is Hell, the one who is ultimately accountable for every wrongful sending of souls to this Hell, God Himself!

Some states also ban the private consumption of alcohol by those under the age of twenty-one, though this is not required by the Act.

The highest court authority is defending a man whose music made children kill themselves but was it truly the music that made them kill themselves? No it was their stupid minds that made things up as they were listening to the song. No way would just listening to a song make you kill yourself even if the song itself kept saying kill yourself in it. This proves that music causes more bad behavior in teens than games. Games may make you do some stupid things, which is impossible since a game is just a disc you put into a game system or computer that is made for, I don't know ENTERTAINMENT for people who are bored. Games are important tools for creativity for teens like myself. I watched games for 4 years before I even started playing them just to learn more about them. It takes a very weak mind to not being able to stop yourself from taking a gun and high-jacking a car and going on a rampage. Games themselves may, how would I say this, ""influence"" the actions some kids may take but who is it actually doing these actions? Is the game somehow possessing the games like how demons or ghosts may possess a person? Are these games taking control of their moral being? No, these are just some stupid kids who think they are being cool but are really about to ruin games for every kid under 18 who plays M rated games. If parents think they are the ones protecting their children well they are wrong. A kid walks up to their parents and says may I have MW3? I will be nice to everyone and won't go on a killing spree! Will the parents say, well now that you put it that way... No that is poor judgement from the parents! You can't blame a child for something that their parental guardians bought for them because if it is games causing the bad behavior and if those news reports are right HOW CAN YOU BLAME THE CHILD!? Oh, it is the child playing this game they are the ones to blame. They aren't the ones who got 60 dollars to pay for it. They aren't the ones who went and bought this M rated game. It was their parents are guardian figures like an older brother or uncle or aunt. You cannot blame a child for a parents mistake. If you don't want you child who is probably a perfect little angel like you portray them to be don't give them M rated games that you might say will ""corrupt their little minds!"" You cannot blame a child for some mistake another person made! If you blame a child for smoking you must ask yourself who gave them it. Was it the parent? You don't blame the child, you take that child away from that parent and maybe that parent will be facing a fine. I hope you will realize that children aren't the ones to blame, the parents shouldn't get them these games if you believe it will ""make"" them do it. No, the human mind is more complex than any game could be, it just takes a little COMMON sense to realize it. If a game makes you jump off a 100 foot building and you survive all the time would you jump off this 100 foot building? NO BECAUSE IF WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SMARTEST CREATURES ON EARTH BE SMARTER. If you continue to say that we are debating games and nothing else that is also wrong. As I am to prove that games aren't causing this behavior it is actually the HUMAN MIND. Games are made for entertainment, the HUMAN MIND is created for us to use and if we neglect it's power we shouldn't even watch TV or have one because we won't be able to tell if we are doing something right or wrong.

For example, happy bread. Just because a piece of bread is happy doesn't mean that it isnt still bread, it is just happy bread. 2) The Senate DOES have to do with the Electoral College because it protects state rights, as does the Electoral College. 3) Popular vote gives porportional voice to INDIVIDUALS not STATES. The voice of the smaller states with direct popular would NOT be porpotional to the larger states. 4) PRO- ""The burden of proof still lies upon me to prove that the Direct Popular Vote should replace the Electoral College in presidential elections. I have shown how each of my contentions fixes fundamental flaws in the Electoral College."" However, this is not true. When I attack your third contention by saying that direct popular vote will force candidates to ignore states too, your defense is that the Electoral College has the flaw of ignored states by candidates, NOT that direct popular vote fixes the problem. 5) The Electoral College and Direct Popular Vote are similar in regards to the fact that neither of them solves the problem of ignored states within campaigns. And since Pro had the burden of proof to say that direct popular vote solves the problems of the Electoral College, this point goes to the negative. 6) Distortion doesn't need to be fixed if it is put there PURPOSEFULLY to protect small states. 7) My opponent asked me what the harmful effects were of democracy, and that I failed to show any actual effects. Therefore, I will list all the harmful effects that I have shown throughout the entire debate. ""Democracy itself is not a stable form of government, instead it is the gradual transition from a limited government to the unlimited rule of an oligarchy."" ""the founders had good reason to look upon democracy with contempt because they knew the democracy of the early Greek city-states produced some of the wildest excesses of government imaginable. In every case they ended up with mob rule, then anarchy and finally tyranny under an oligarchy."" 8) Small states aren't prioritized through the Electoral College, they are made equal to the larger states through the Electoral College. I dont see how equality of states is a bad thing. 9) Faithless electors have never decided an election. Therefore, why ""fix"" a problem that has never occured before and statistically probably never will. 10) This seems to be one of the more important points of the debate which is why I will answer it again even though I already answered it in #4. I agree that the Electoral College has flaws in regards to some states aren't recognized during campaigns. However, in order for this point to be awarded it to Pro, Pro must prove that direct popular vote can solve this problem. It doesnt though, because as I proved in my second contention, with direct popular vote, the candidates will only focus on larger states, ignoring the smaller states. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans affirms this by saying, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the electoral college are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states.""

However, in order for this point to be awarded it to Pro, Pro must prove that direct popular vote can solve this problem. It doesnt though, because as I proved in my second contention, with direct popular vote, the candidates will only focus on larger states, ignoring the smaller states. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans affirms this by saying, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the electoral college are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states.""  
  
Since Pro started the debate, I would like it if he only used the final half of the fifth round to say a couple closing sentences at most. Thank you

770,"Thank you for accepting, Con. I look forward to a robust debate. I will structure my argument thus: why schoolchildren should have a uniform dress code, followed by the demerits of a non-uniform dress code. A uniform dress code allows a student to fit in without fear of judgment reflected in the way they dress. A uniform dress code erases social or cultural barriers that manifest in the clothes that children wear. It has been noted that uniforms blur the differences between the different social and economic classes of the families that children come from. This allows children to focus on the learning (that schools purpose to impart) that takes place without fear of judgment from other students, especially in tender, impressionable ages, and teenage years, when social status is of particular consequence to students. In addition, it imparts an important value of respecting each other beyond their social status. Their inability to discern other students' social status results in them treating each other equally and this can lead them to understand that the barriers separating people based on status (etc.) are psychological. A school uniform acts as a unifying element between all the students. They wear it every day and are identified based on that, when they are in school or even outside. This allows for it to increase the unity and team spirit between the students, effectively improving their love for their school and improving the environment for each student. School uniform reduces the potential for a teacher to subconsciously pick favourites among students, based on their appearance and dress. Bearing in mind that clothes contribute to the first impression a person gives off, it is understandable, yet undesirable for teachers to subconsciously form more positive or negative impressions of certain students based on the way they dress. It goes against a school's purpose of imparting knowledge and inculcating character. Uniforms prepare students for the reality of the world that awaits them. A great many professions, both high-skilled and otherwise, make use of a strict uniform dress code. The reasons for these include respect to the responsibility of the profession, respect to the people they interact with, or simply a desire to impress and give off an impression of attention to detail and good grooming. I shall give just a few examples. In the law industry, lawyers in most countries have a strict dress code before attending court, judges wear robes and in many jurisdictions, even wigs. Employees in banks have a strict dress code, extending even to the way they present their hair. Businessmen and government officials wear suits or office attire. Constitutional institutions like police and fire defence have their own uniforms. In more technical professions, less of this is seen, though janitors are an example of those who often wear a certain uniform. In short, including uniforms in school allow children to come to understand and expect the demands of appearance that the world makes of professionals. I shall now move on to disadvantages of having a free or non-uniform dress code. Having a free dress code places stress on students to wear clothes that are in fashion, or that measure up to the standards held in school. Often, appearance is linked to self-worth and this manifests in worry about appearance and by extension, self-worth, which is undesirable in a school setting. It is also unproductive for students to spend a lot of time (which can happen) pondering what to wear the next day. The ex-President of the Group Resolving Antisocial Problems in Anaheim, California, stated in 1994 that she believed that a free dress code contributed to the country's societal breakdown. This is especially because she felt that it goes further than encouraging free expression; it is a distraction for students during school time. I am certain that my worthy opponent sees the point: for students to spend time attempting to craft an ""appropriate"" identity in terms of clothing and fashion distracts them from exploring knowledge and academics, which is the primary function of any school. The source also advises that a free dress code is not appropriate during school, but that ""[s]elf-expression in clothes is appropriate after school, on weekends and vacation"". A study done by Lillian O. Holloman, assistant professor of clothing and textiles in Virginia Tech's College of Human Resources, states the following: ""School officials have observed that a significant number of antisocial, even violent, acts performed by youths both on and off school premises have been related to clothing. According to state law enforcement officials, some of the most severe problems include assault and robbery by youths for sneakers, jewelry, and professional sports-team jackets or because groups wear certain styles and colors that promote hostility in rival groups. One of the most commonly occurring crimes is the theft from stores of popular, status clothing."" This reiterates that a free dress code can cause unnecessary stress to students attempting to conform to certain standards, and can encourage antisocial, rebellious behaviour such as crime. Finally, a free dress code can substantially raise the risk of people wearing obscene, inappropriate, or offensive clothing. It is more than obvious that this is thoroughly unconducive for the learning environment in a school, and in more extreme cases, could lead to altercations if anyone gets offended by something that someone is wearing. I conclude with my position that a uniform dress code is the best approach for a school to take, and that a free or non-uniform dress code carries with it several undesirable side-effects, of which it is in the best interests of any school not to deal with. I look forward to seeing Con's counter-arguments. References: Smith, Katherine. ""School Uniforms Change Behavior."" Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Times, 6 Mar. 1994. Web. 25 Sept. 2014. <URL>...

To restate it: Rawls assumes that the people in the OP are not simply choosing between systems of governance (say, democracy vs monarchy vs anarchy). The society he says people will choose isn't simply 'a democracy'--it is a democratic society populated by people who choose to implement a large welfare state. But if we have the luxury of choosing what sort of people are society is populated by in the OP, why not choose an anarchic society populated by really nice people who give a lot to charity? And, if the theory is modified so that we don't have that luxury, and are only choosing between different systems, rather than sets of specific policies under those systems, then Rawls and Pro give us no reasons to choose a society with a government over a society without one. Universal consent: Simply defining the people in the OP as agreeing with each other is nonsense. People value different things differently--risk aversion, for example. If no valuation of, say, risk aversion is more rational than any other, then policies that are different because of the value they place on risk aversion can't be more or less rational then each other. And since there's no specific government that could be universally agreed on, any form of government that is established would have to be some's subjective idea of what's rational forced on others without their consent--making this not a valid social contract. Risk-aversion: Again, by this logic, a risk taker would never do anything that could endanger his health or life! No risk taker would ever go skydiving because there's a chance that he could die and never be able to take risks again. Obviously, this conclusion is absurd. Risk-takers, by definition, are willing to accept a chance of bad things happening to them. It's true that we wouldn't know the specific numbers and percentages in play, but, since we're talking about risk-takers, this doesn't matter--they could be willing to take the risk that the percentage of something bad happening is high, because they're risk-takers! Actual vs Hypothetical Consent: "" To make an analogy, let's say I propose that there is a hypothetical committee filled with people who are in-tune with moral understanding. In other words, they are so smart they can figure out what is morally correct. I then argue that whatever agreements the committee come to, is what is moral."" I suppose this is technically true, because you're defining the committee as being able to figure out what is morally correct. But that isn't at all what Rawls says, so this is a bad analogy. His hypothetical people aren't morally perfect, they are essentially just perfect egalitarians. Only if you first accept that taking a bunch of hypothetical egalitarians and having them decide what society should look like is the correct way to determine morality does this theory work. In addition, actual consent does matter. The idea of a social contract is that people have rights, but because of this contract the government can violate them. Even Rawls' hypothetical people are presumed free--they are supposed to freely choose what society should look like. And so even do accept Rawls' egalitarian premises, even if his society was the best sort of society, that wouldn't give government the moral right to violate people's rights, any more than (to reuse my previous example) I would have the right to rape someone who I somehow knew deep down really did want to have sex with me.",1,LaissezFaire,"

2) Demonstrating how and why Socialism upholds the ideals of Democracy more effectively through the use of both social aide and welfare and the prevention of corporate corruption and tyranny, as well as ensuring the protection of minority rights while still allowing majority rule.  
  
3) Rebutting my opponent's arguments as necessary.

Although we do not need cars to survive, the use of automobiles has been ingrained into our society enough that we would not be able to function properly without them.

Now I don't they should change the text to change what it entails, but to eliminate confusion. I am a firm believer that it was written only about the militia. Otherwise they would have put it as two amendments or worded it differently. What gives it away to me is the, ""being necessary"" and the comma.

790,"I have no problem using the definitions. However, I would like my opponent to look closely at the article. ""Bear in mind that this list is not meant to be a ""cult scale"" or a definitive checklist to determine if a specific group is a cult. This is not so much a diagnostic instrument as it is an analytical tool.""(1) Clearly the article states that although these are usually defined in dangerous cults, this is not the only criteria that should be considered when determining if someone is in a cult or not. As i have stated before, I believe there are many benign, simple, peaceful religions, that many would categorize as cults. The Raelian church was a great example. However, these are still cults nonetheless and fall under the general definition. ""I am not arguing whether AA can be viewed as religious to some. People choose their own conception of a Higher Power. Even atheist and agnostics can find a definition that works for them."" Really. And what sort of ""Higher power"" could an atheist call upon, to which they are helpless against? ""The Agnostic AA meetings have their own preamble, which is:"" The agnostic AA meetings are different and separate than the AA meetings. The 12 steps, the core of the AA system, is completely void from the Agnostic AA system. One could call it a different ""Sect"" if you will. Again, none of what you have brought deny the fact that the ""Higher power"" is assumed to be God, nor the fact that any other religious organization that has been deemed a cult by one person or another, does not practice the same things. Rebuttal 1. ""Besides, the practices of the 12 Steps are not mandatory. Again, the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. No one makes anyone do the 12 Steps."" Again, no. When i am a christian, i do not have to attend church every sunday. It is not mandatory that i do so. Rebuttal 2. Again, there is nothing within the sects of christianity, for example, that force its members not to question their beliefs. In fact, Mother Teresa was famous for having doubts about her beliefs as well(2). Rebuttal 3. Although i do not consider the Agnostic AA groups, to be the same as the AA groups, Chanting is still apart of the AA group meetings. And furthermore, again, the checklist is a specific criterion for identifying dangerous cult activities. The actual definition of what a Cult is, still allows for the AA group to go under a heading of a ""Cult"". Rebuttal 4. Again, a warning sign for dangerous cult activities. Congratulations, AA does not have a cult leader. Although this is not a must, for something to be a dangerous cult, it is also not a must for being a cult in general, either. Rebuttal 5. As i have stated before(3), the original manuscript of the 12 steps, contain the word ""God"", blatantly, by the person who founded the organization in the first place. "", but I do not believe that my answer or your question is relevant to the debate, since it has nothing to do with the definition/criteria of a cult."" Actually, it does. A cult is defined as ""reverence and homage to divine beings"". Clearly, a higher power, that is assumed to be God, is an extremely important criteria for determining if an organization is a cult. So i ask the question again. What is the first thing that comes into your, or anyones mind, when the word ""Higher power"" is mentioned? ""There are such conceptions as 'Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind, or Spirit of Nature, God, and so much more."" And i would consider all those to be religious. Rebuttal 8.

Nowhere in the original article does it state that these are the only criterions for determining if a religious organization or any organization, is a cult. Only that these are hints, and that these point to whether or not an organization could be a DANGEROUS cult. And this is the point i was trying to make. None of these criterions need not apply, for an organization to be a cult. Although my opponent was quick to avoid answering the question of ""What is the first thing that comes to mind when the word ""Higher power"" is mentioned"", possibly because he knows the answer already, my only conclusion as to why my opponent refuses to answer this question is because he knows he will have to admit that the ""Higher power"" is pointing to a God, thus, making AA a religious, and a cult-like group.

I have no problem using the definitions. However, I would like my opponent to look closely at the article.  
  
""Bear in mind that this list is not meant to be a ""cult scale"" or a definitive checklist to determine if a specific group is a cult. This is not so much a diagnostic instrument as it is an analytical tool.""(1)  
  
Clearly the article states that although these are usually defined in dangerous cults, this is not the only criteria that should be considered when determining if someone is in a cult or not.  
  
As i have stated before, I believe there are many benign, simple, peaceful religions, that many would categorize as cults. The Raelian church was a great example. However, these are still cults nonetheless and fall under the general definition.  
  
""I am not arguing whether AA can be viewed as religious to some. People choose their own conception of a Higher Power. Even atheist and agnostics can find a definition that works for them.""  
  
Really. And what sort of ""Higher power"" could an atheist call upon, to which they are helpless against?  
  
""The Agnostic AA meetings have their own preamble, which is:""  
  
The agnostic AA meetings are different and separate than the AA meetings. The 12 steps, the core of the AA system, is completely void from the Agnostic AA system. One could call it a different ""Sect"" if you will.  
  
Again, none of what you have brought deny the fact that the ""Higher power"" is assumed to be God, nor the fact that any other religious organization that has been deemed a cult by one person or another, does not practice the same things.  
  
Rebuttal 1.  
""Besides, the practices of the 12 Steps are not mandatory. Again, the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. No one makes anyone do the 12 Steps.""  
  
Again, no. When i am a christian, i do not have to attend church every sunday. It is not mandatory that i do so.  
  
Rebuttal 2.  
Again, there is nothing within the sects of christianity, for example, that force its members not to question their beliefs. In fact, Mother Teresa was famous for having doubts about her beliefs as well(2).  
  
Rebuttal 3.  
Although i do not consider the Agnostic AA groups, to be the same as the AA groups, Chanting is still apart of the AA group meetings. And furthermore, again, the checklist is a specific criterion for identifying dangerous cult activities. The actual definition of what a Cult is, still allows for the AA group to go under a heading of a ""Cult"".  
  
Rebuttal 4.  
Again, a warning sign for dangerous cult activities. Congratulations, AA does not have a cult leader. Although this is not a must, for something to be a dangerous cult, it is also not a must for being a cult in general, either.  
  
Rebuttal 5.  
As i have stated before(3), the original manuscript of the 12 steps, contain the word ""God"", blatantly, by the person who founded the organization in the first place.  
  
"", but I do not believe that my answer or your question is relevant to the debate, since it has nothing to do with the definition/criteria of a cult.""  
  
Actually, it does. A cult is defined as ""reverence and homage to divine beings"". Clearly, a higher power, that is assumed to be God, is an extremely important criteria for determining if an organization is a cult.  
  
So i ask the question again. What is the first thing that comes into your, or anyones mind, when the word ""Higher power"" is mentioned?  
  
""There are such conceptions as ‘Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind, or Spirit of Nature, God, and so much more.""  
  
And i would consider all those to be religious.  
  
Rebuttal 8.  
Since my opponent agrees with me, i suppose this is a concluded point.  
  
Rebuttal 11.  
""Since members are not preoccupied with recruiting new members, they surely do not meet the criteria of a cult, thus AA is not a cult.""  
  
Are you saying that AA is not actively seeking to help other people, via advertisement or any other public forum?

Nowhere in the original article does it state that these are the only criterions for determining if a religious organization or any organization, is a cult. Only that these are hints, and that these point to whether or not an organization could be a DANGEROUS cult. And this is the point i was trying to make.

If Spider-Man simply reverts the Hulk to Bruce Banner by making him as calm as possible, he can prove to be the victor in a battle against the Hulk. Given that Spider-Man is in fact one of the most intelligent non cosmic characters in the Marvel Universe (even Ant man considered Peter to be far more intelligent that he is) and that he has worked with the Hulk on the Avengers long enough to understand how he thinks, Spider-Man would easily deduce a method which could be used to relax the Hulk enough to revert him to Bruce Banner. This would require that Spider-Man not fight the Hulk (as fighting him would make him angry), however . . . ""not fighting"" during the battle wouldn't be a problem considering that the Hulk is familiar with Spider-man and has worked alongside him, thus wouldn't see him as a threat unless Spider-Man began to attack him. Once he reverted to Bruce Banner, the Hulk would no longer be conscious and Spider-Man would be the victor automatically. Of course, if my opponent objects to the Hulk persona merely being unconscious as not being enough for victory, I could simply point out that Spider-man could use his super human agility to speed blitz Banner (in other words, knock him out) before he could even realize, hence preventing his Hulk persona from interfering and insuring Spidey a victory. ============================================================================ CONTENTION #2: Spider-Man knows how to kill the Hulk ============================================================================ The following conversation takes place in Amazing Spider-man Vol 2 #54.

Thus, Spider-Man would merely have to do the following to win:

CONTENTION #2: Spider-Man knows how to kill the Hulk  
============================================================================  
  
The following conversation takes place in Amazing Spider-man Vol 2 #54.  
  
SPIDEY: Everybody in our odd little community would deny it, but we all watch each other when we cross paths, looking for weaknesses, in case that day ever comes. In case they ever have to stop me...or I ever have to stop them. But we never talk about it. Ever.

Anyway I agree that all 3 of your points can and do occur; however, if I come up with a way to make voting on this site fair than you would have lost the debate. Here's one idea: While registering for a Debate.org account, each individual should have to provide either a debit or credit card confirmation. This would eliminate the creation of multiple accounts by one person. If one chooses to use more than one card to sign up for 2-3 accounts (say one of their debit cards and one of their credit cards), not only would it be easier for the Webmaster to detect, but it might also be ""fair"" if each member has to pay $1 to join. If someone is willing to pay $1 for an extra vote, some may deem it okay because they're actually paying for something as frivolous as one lousy vote on Debate.org. For those members under 18 or who do not have their own credit/debit card, obviously they can ask a parent or friend to borrow theirs for the one time usage/fee of $1. My younger brother and all of his friends aged 5 - 15 all use their parents' card to sign up for extra tools on the online game site Runescape, so obviously this is a practical idea that can and already is put into use on other sites. It's not an issue. Plus, that site charges $5 a month whereas this site can only have a tiny, one-time fee with the only purpose being making the voting more fair -- not making more money for the site. However, assuming that there actually are 4,000+ members on this site, that would be $4,000+ more dollars that go towards the Debate.org team which may assist the owners in speeding up the new feature implementation. I s'pose that has nothing to do with the voting so I digress. Now as far as my opponent's #1 and #2 problems, I have a few ideas. First, just as with the debate tournament on Facebook, perhaps people should have to provide at least a brief explanation explaining why they voted the way they did. There can be a necessary 25 character minimum while submitting a vote the same way there is a character minimum for debate rounds and comments. If people have shallow reasoning behind their vote, other members can either choose to ignore it, or do something more vindictive like shallowly vote against that particular individual. The choice is theirs and that makes it fair. Second, if someone wants to vote solely based on the resolution, that's really di I'll admit that these ideas aren't perfect, but they ARE fair. Even if it burdens a small minority, the fact that it might greatly benefit the majority of site participants AND the Debate.org team make it fair.

Since I am PRO, and my opponent has not bothered to do so, I shall define some of the words in my resolution. ""Kony"", of course, is referring to Joseph Kony, leader of the LRA [1]. ""Good"" is a moral statement. Since I am pro and defending the resolution, I get to decide what moral code ""good"" falls under. Unless my opponent wishes to argue for an objective moral code (which he would have the BOP), this is what we will measure by. We shall use Machiavellian Virtue ethics code [2][3]. To simplify, Machiavellianism can be summed up by his single most famous line ""The end justifies the means."" And Viture ethics can be summed up as the intent of an action determines its moral standing, rather than any results or rules that are followed/broken. Following this, we can state that the end intent justifies any means. A simple example would be if a girl asks ""does this dress make me look fat?"" Saying ""no"" would be morally acceptable since the end you were attempting to reach out weighs the act of lying, and you had a good intent on not wanting to hurt her feelings (unless you were saying ""no"" so that she would go around town and have others laugh at her, that's not cool dude). Now that we have Kony and the our moral compass defined and set, we can get going with this debate. The rest of the words should be understood by their common modern meaning (no semantics). I shall also like to state (though it should be understood, I will still state it) that to be a ""good person"" one must not be 100% good, just like to be a ""bad person"" one must not be 100% bad. It is not a one or the other dichotomy, but a sliding scale, where a ""good person"" is one who does mostly good, and a ""bad person"" is one who does mostly bad. This is being stated so that there is no impression in my opponent's (or the voters') mind that all he has to do is show a single ""bad"" thing. I shall now argue that Kony is, indeed, a good person who is doing the morally right thing. All of Kony's work is for the purpose of ""cleans[ing] the Acholi people."" [4] Under our moral code, Kony has set an ethical goal with an ethical intent. We may not agree with the means that he uses, but that does not matter when it comes to the morals of the person. This single line of argument is all that is needed for now.

822,"I thank Con for providing his arguments. Rebuttals Con begins his statement with a baseless claim that 'Bernie Sanders' person would not be substantial enough to defeat Trump' This argument is simply ridiculous. His policies have resonated well with a large number of Americans [1], as for his 'person' as Con puts it, not being 'substantial enough' to defeat Donald Trump, that is simply irrelevant and must be ignored. He goes on to say that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote 'because of her outstanding experience, record for goodwill and resillience during endless tirades of baseless allegations' This groundless praise of Hillary Clinton is incorrect. The remarkably low turnout of voters [1] who voted Democratic is anything but proof of the American people rushing to the voting booth because of her outstanding experience and 'record for goodwill', and while yes, she did win the popular vote, it is not the measure by which the President of the United States is chosen and thus plays an irrelevant part in the conversation. As for the 'baseless allegations', one could call them baseless while the other would not, the fact of the matter remains that Bernie Sanders, contrary to Hillary Clinton did not (and does not) have a track record of disastrous and controversial decisions (Iraq War vote, PATRIOT Act vote, TPP lobbying, Paid speeches to Wall Street firms, the remarkably careless decision to use her own private e-mail server, her push for regime change around the world, on and on) Instead, Bernie Sanders would have been the clean, scandal-free candidate that Hillary was not. He then goes on to state that no democratic candidate would have won, an incredibly erroneous statement, because 'the Electoral College' leads to the Republican candidate succeeding. That argument is by default erroneous, President Barack Obama led the party tolandslideback-to-back Electoral College victories. Con simply puts forward a fallacious mentality used by Pro-Clinton crowds, to blame the Electoral College system. Yet, she knew the rules of the game and she partook in it. And while it's true that the smaller states receive more votes than they should, it's simply ill-founded to even entertain the idea that Wyoming and its 3 electoral votes totally tipped the election to the Republicans. Truth is, Hillary Clinton seriously underperformed. All that was necessary was to hang on to Obama's coalition, it would have suffised to see the Democrats keep hold of the White House. But she continually snubbed blue-collar americans, progressives, millenials, stuck to a brand of identity politics that completely back-fired on her (see diminished female vote, millenial vote and even latino vote [3]) Rebuttal to 'Socialism and Judaism' This is where it gets interesting, and also extremely flawed. Con begins by stating that Bernie Sanders is a self-proclaimed Socialist, which he has denied multiple times. He has stated himself as a Democratic-Socialist.

  I thank Con for providing his arguments.  Rebuttals  Con begins his statement with a baseless claim that 'Bernie Sanders' person would not be substantial enough to defeat Trump' This argument is simply ridiculous. His policies have resonated well with a large number of Americans [1], as for his 'person' as Con puts it, not being 'substantial enough' to defeat Donald Trump, that is simply irrelevant and must be ignored. He goes on to say that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote 'because of her outstanding experience, record for goodwill and resillience during endless tirades of baseless allegations' This groundless praise of Hillary Clinton is incorrect. The   remarkably low turnout   of voters [1] who voted Democratic is anything but proof of the American people rushing to the voting booth because of her outstanding experience and 'record for goodwill', and while yes, she did win the popular vote, it is not the measure by which the President of the United States is chosen and thus plays an irrelevant part in the conversation. As for the 'baseless allegations', one could call them baseless while the other would not, the fact of the matter remains that Bernie Sanders, contrary to Hillary Clinton   did not (and does not) have a track record of disastrous and controversial decisions   (Iraq War vote, PATRIOT Act vote, TPP lobbying, Paid speeches to Wall Street firms, the remarkably careless decision to use her own private e-mail server, her push for regime change around the world, on and on) Instead, Bernie Sanders would have been the clean, scandal-free candidate that Hillary was not.  He then goes on to state that no democratic candidate would have won, an incredibly erroneous statement, because 'the Electoral College' leads to the Republican candidate succeeding. That argument is by default erroneous, President Barack Obama led the party tolandslideback-to-back Electoral College victories. Con simply puts forward a fallacious mentality used by Pro-Clinton crowds, to blame the Electoral College system. Yet, she knew the rules of the game and she partook in it. And while it's true that the smaller states receive more votes than they should, it's simply ill-founded to even entertain the idea that Wyoming and its 3 electoral votes totally tipped the election to the Republicans. Truth is, Hillary Clinton seriously underperformed. All that was necessary was to hang on to Obama's coalition, it would have suffised to see the Democrats keep hold of the White House. But she continually snubbed blue-collar americans, progressives, millenials, stuck to a brand of identity politics that completely back-fired on her (see diminished female vote, millenial vote and even latino vote [3])    Rebuttal to 'Socialism and Judaism'  This is where it gets interesting, and also extremely flawed. Con begins by stating that Bernie Sanders is a self-proclaimed Socialist, which he has denied multiple times. He has stated himself as a Democratic-Socialist. And while it is frequent for the Centrist wing of the Democratic Party to brush him aside as a radical socialist nut job, they're quick to forget that in the span of a year,   with no Super Pac funding  ,   absolutely no Political recognition  , and a   position of 3% in all national polls  , with the   mainstream media giving him little to no chance of winning a single state  , he managed to win 23.

If I recall correctly, Satan fell from grace before the timeline of the Bible begins, so this is a perfectly plausible. Judging by the Bible's body count, God has committed more immoral acts than Satan. >> ""If you'll recall in Job Satan tells god that Job is only faithful because he has not been physically hurt and then Satan asks god for the permission to harm him and god says yes but don't kill him.""

>> ""Satan cannot be more moral than god because of his direct intentions to harm people. ""  
  
Intentions are not the standard of review - a Biblical Body Count is.  
  
>> ""How can Satan be more moral than god when he directly is a creation of god! We are no better than those who create us! ""  
  
False - It is easy to conceive of a moral God that creates a moral being with free will (that subsequently becomes immoral), and then this moral God commits immoral acts. If I recall correctly, Satan fell from grace before the timeline of the Bible begins, so this is a perfectly plausible. Judging by the Bible's body count, God has committed more immoral acts than Satan.  
  
>> ""If you'll recall in Job Satan tells god that Job is only faithful because he has not been physically hurt and then Satan asks god for the permission to harm him and god says yes but don't kill him.""  
  
Our wonderfully moral God grants Satan permission to harm others so he can make a point. Great.  
  
>> ""Satan himself tried to fight god and that is how he wound up in hell. The bible also clearly states that Satan will try to deceive and and manipulate to get as many as he can in hell with him.""  
  
Wonderful. But we're not talking about that. We're talking about how many people God killed compared to how many Satan killed in the Bible.  
  
>> ""God is more moral and just because that is his purpose.""  
  
That's circular reasoning. God is moral because it is his purpose to be moral. Uncompelling. That's like saying ""My coke can is a coke can because it's purpose is to be a coke can.""  
  
>> ""As for Job and his family they were all resurrected and Job healed and PROSPERED past his one hundreds in age!!!!""  
  
Wonderful - more ammunition for my argument. I shall apply this to the count.

My opponent attacks the example without actually addressing the main point of the 1st counter-argument I give. The gist of that was the profiling will happen with or without a decal. Police officers profile based on age, or sex, or ethnicity just by looking into a car window. They profile with regards to types and quality of car. This is basically a wash. However, as stated in my 3rd counter-argument, since the decals do allow for an increase in defensive driving, which will inherently increase the overall safety of all drivers, I'm still winning the cost/benefit analysis. On Electronic Parking Permits: 1. How many high schools in the US are really using these? 2. Way more importantly, this is an attack on an example while totally ignoring the meat of the argument, which is about profiling occurring against young people no matter what. On decal quality and appearance: 1. Attack on the example. 2. The chief administrator shall provide the holder of a special learner's permit with two removable, transferable, highly visible, reflective decals indicating that the driver of the vehicle may be the holder of a special learner's permit. [1] This decal is perfectly removable, and the law does not mention the size of the decal. If we are going to argue about the specifics of the decal, then it can be removed any time the student is parked. This would further mitigate whatever minute harms can be gained off of the sexual predator argument, because only vehicles in motion would be subject to target, and sexual predators simply don't target their victims by following their moving vehicles around town or on the freeway. These harms are totally unwarranted. On campus security and sexual predators: Campus security is really null in this debate. Again, this was merely an example that my opponent is exploiting while ignoring the gist of the argument. Sexual predators target places where these young people hang out (i.e. are generally stationary) *like* school campuses, churches, playgrounds, parks, local hang outs, etc. He never warrants why it is that sexual predators will target vehicles. Furthermore, as I mention later, we don't have a problem with predators targeting driver education vehicles, all of which, by the way, are required by law to be marked as such constantly (those markings are generally not removable since the vehicle has been mechanically manipulated as a training vehicle). However, even if they weren't, by my opponent's logic, those vehicles and their passengers *should* be the target of predators. On the attack on my second source: 1. My opponent disregards the first source, handily, which states that: ""The risk of being involved in a car accident the highest for drivers aged 16- to 19-year-olds than it is for any other age group. For each mile driven, teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are about four times more likely than other drivers to crash."" ""Teenagers are about 10 percent of the US Population but account for 12 percent all Fatal Car Crashes. 2. While I can't find the chart my opponent refers to (can I have a specific link so I can evaluate the data?), we are talking about aggregate death, not a breakdown of the cause or number of passengers or any other important details that would allow us to assess the meaning of those stats. 3. The statistic I was specifically referring to was on the page *of* that link. It is a pie chart stating that motor vehicle deaths account for more teen deaths than any other cause. The next closest method of teen death is homicide. 4. My opponent's narrowly focused attack does not actually mitigate the argument I'm making that teen drivers are still a danger due to their relative lack of driving experience. The second source I listed is an entire government webpage dedicated to improving teen driving. Obviously, the federal government is concerned to a great extent about the safety of teen drivers. On student driver cars being marked: 1. What's the point of this rebuttal? The decals are fully removable, so the harms of these decals must be identical to those of student driver vehicles. So, my opponent is de facto arguing that we should not put markings on student driver vehicles as well. However, the safety benefits of this practice are clear. The same principle clearly supports the use of New Jersey's new decal. On my dropped 4th counter-argument and dropped alternative: 1. My 4th counter-argument is absolutely topical to this debate. My opponent directly stated in RD 1 that one of the harms of the decal, based on his profiling argument, was that teens with tickets won't have recourse once the citation has been issued. How is me addressing this fallacy not a point of contention? He is claiming that this inherent bias exists within the judicial system as well as the enforcement system, when it clearly doesn't. You can extend this as a valid offensive argument. 2. My alternative proposal is also directly related to the case at hand. My opponent is opposing this piece of legislation due to something he finds morally or ethically repugnant. I am doing the exact same thing. If the goal of this debate is to form a more just law (and, considering that the purpose of debate is to support some sort of change, even if it won't necessarily happen), then I am attempting to fulfill that goal better than my opponent.

851,"I thank @VulpeLegatus for accepting to debate me on this very interesting motion. To answer Con, I did not support Clinton over Trump, I remained neutral. Let's get into it, I strongly believe Bernie Sanders would have convincingly defeated Donald Trump, a historically unpopular (refer to unfavorability ratings throughout the election) candidate, in what was supposed to be a democratic slam dunk election. But she, and her extremely heavy baggage, as well as poor voting record, establishment and centrist/corporatist ties, was undoubtedly the worst candidate the democrats could've fielded, as her weaknesses lined up to Trump's strengths. A1 : Demographics The first hints of a Bernie win in the general were in the demographic breakdown of the votes. Indeed, in areas where Hillary underperformed Obama (thus leading to defeat), Bernie was consistently doing better than her. Nowhere is that more evident than for the millennial vote, a tremendously important consistuency for a Blue victory. Hillary's campaign registered a significant 6 points drop from 2012 [1] However, Bernie Sanders enjoys unprecented support among millenials. As TIME put it so eloquently : 'Bernie Sanders has trounced Hillary, poll after poll', Notably, one survey even showing that he is the most respected political figure among that age group.[2] Ahead of the popular democratic President and any Republican and Democratic lawmaker in the country. Hillary even underperformed with the female vote, a voting bloc she was expected to sweep. The reason? Discontent among white working class voters, Male and Female alike. [3] The same voting bloc Hillary's campaign used as evidence to smear Bernie Sanders as a non-diverse candidate. 'For every blue-collar democrat we lose, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia and you can repeat that in Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin' This ridiculously flawed mentality outlined by close Clinton ally, Chuck Schumer, is exactly what turned an easily-winnable election into an unpredicted Trump victory. Throwing working class white democrats under the bus, as well as snubbing millenials and progressives, to appeal to moderate Republicans is a losing strategy. Go figure . Bernie appealed to white working class voters in the critical states of the Rust Belt, the states that were supposedly 'democratic firewalls' that Hillary managed to hand over to the Republicans for the first time since the mid-1980s [4] and he appealed to independants and progressives, who went third party in record numbers not seen since the 2000 Presidential Election. A2 : Strengths and Weaknesses The most important factor leading to Hillary's humiliating defeat, is that her, many, flaws, all lined up to Trump's strengths. His populist message was able to resonate because Hillary's decades of public service have outlined her multiple contradictions and have only strenghtened her image as a corporatist, corrupt establishment politician. Most famously, his constant badgering of her support for disastrous trade deals, as well her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal (she lobbied for it despite her claiming she's opposed to it) [5] at a time when manufacturing jobs where in mass exodus thanks to those very same deals, helped land a fatal blow to the Democrats. While Trump was traveling around the country advocating for an end to the disastrous trade deals that led to a loss of manufacturing jobs, guess who had voted for the very same deals? Hillary. Guess who had spoken out against them? Bernie Sanders. While Trump was rallying up masses and speaking outagainst the War in Iraq, the very same, costly and deadly war that Hillary voted for, [6] while Trump was speaking out against the countless interventions of regime change that Hillary supported around the world [7], Americans were listening. And he was able to successfully ride a wave of anti-establishment populism, the very same establishment-corporatism that defined Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders, however, offered the same populist, anti-establishment, anti-TPP, and anti-interventionnist message that Trump offered, and that the American people were longing for, minus the bigotry, xenophobia and racism that caracterized Trump's campaign. Conclusion This election was the Democrats' to lose. The Republicans had nominated the most unpopular candidate in, probably, American History, ridden with controversy. A Presidential candidate, caught bragging on tape of commiting sexual assaults, publically bragging of tax evasion, amongst others. She, in spite of receiving the backing of a popular President, a (really) popular First Lady, countless celebrities and public figures, Hillary Clinton managed to lose the election. Her neglect for the working class of America, only playing in Trump's favour. Had the Democrats nominated Bernie to lead the fight in the General Election, there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that he would've won in an electoral landslide. Not only for the consistent polling data that showed him ahead of Trump by double digits [8] not only because his message resonated with all the voting blocs that Hillary Clinton lost, but also simply because he was the polar opposite of Hillary Clinton. She was the out-of-touch, establishment candidate that embodied the 'swamp' Trump spoke out against. And such was the disdain towards the establishement that the American people were ready to hand the helms of the nation to Donald Trump. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... , <URL>... [4] <URL>...

Here is the original 12 steps presented by the founder of AA(1). 1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol--that our lives had become unmanageable. 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. 9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. 10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out. 12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. Notice the multiple mentions of God. The fact that currently, AA has become more lenient in its 12 steps, is akin to the creationist movement changing their stance to ""Intelligent design"" in order to suppose that this ""intelligent designer"" does not have to be God, thus not making it a religious view. However, despite this, for the sake of this debate, i shall adress all the points made by my opponent. 1). I agree, that cults are ""charismatic groups with a high level of social cohesion, an intensely held belief system and a profound influence on its members behavior"". However, this is rarely the purpose of any cult. As seen by this Cult(2), the purpose of this cult is to spread the message of the fact that aliens created human beings. Yet, it is a cult nonetheless. 2). One does not have to punish its members, in order to become a cult. Christianity, to some, is a cult. Yet, rarely is anyone punished in the USA for leaving christianity. 3). Again, when i enter a church, i do not have to pray. 4). Cults do not require leaders in order to become cults. 5). DING DING DING DING DING! Higher power. This is the keyword. The higher power is in most cases, assumed to be God. Again, this is absurd as claiming that Creationism is ""Intelligent design"", but claiming that this ""Intelligent designer"" does not have to be God, and can be anything the person wishes to choose it to be. The courts STILL ruled against it on the grounds that intelligent design IS religious. And to settle this once and for all, id like to ask my opponent, what possible higher power could exist, other than God, that helps you move away from alcoholism, and what is the first thing that comes to mind, when someone suggests a ""Higher power""? 6). What does this have to do with AA being a cult? 7). See rebuttal 4. 8). Cults are not always destructive. Cults are not always unethical. You watch too many horror movies.

Again, there is nothing in the definition of cult, that requires cult members to cut ties to their families. 11). Again, there is nothing within a cult system that encourages hate or violence. In conclusion, my opponent has watched too many horror movies, where Cult members eat babies and sacrifice nonbelievers. Rarely do these things occur. And this is the problem. No one is claiming that the AA system does not work. No one is claiming that the AA system is inneffective. The truth is that the AA system is just as effective as any other secular alcoholic treatment program. The problem, however, is that when you have a system that makes you dependant on a ""higher power"", you take away someones self-worth. The twelve step program, admits this, with their first step; ""We admitted we were powerless over alcohol"". AA creates the mindset, that without God, or a ""Higher power"", you are powerless, and therefore takes away the guilt of drinking. Taking away your guilt about anything, is the worst thing that could possibly occur. Once you relapse, once you start drinking again, you have this belief that it is not your fault that you are drinking, that you are powerless to stop it.

To summarise the situation. 1: Intelligent Aliens are travelling in a space ship towards earth. 2: Humanity is aware of this. 3: The ship will arrive in a year. 4: The aliens have either come in peace, or intend to wage war. It is highly unlikely that the aliens have come from a world in our solar system, at least not originally. It is reasonable to presume that should an advanced alien race have developed in our system we would have been in receipt of their radio signals for many years, just as our own radio signals 'pollute' our region of space. It is also likely that our probes would already have crossed paths. So I argue that the aliens are from another Star System. This gives us the following options, 1: Faster than/Equal to/Near Light Travel The aliens are so advanced that they can travel between Stars in a reasonable time frame. Instantly, or a few years, as opposed to the millions of years that many scientists fear we shall be restricted to. Such a technology is so in advanced of us that its posessers would be able to view us, study us, even interact secretly with us. For instance mankind is not far from proper direct observation of interstellar planets (we are already detecting them and analysing their atmospheres) and these aliens are so much more in advance of us. In addition this technology is not consistent with the fact that the observed vessel is one year away from us. So I do not believe that this option is reasonable. 2: Sleeper/Generation ships. The aliens are not so advanced and are restricted to relatively slow interstellar transports. They may have developed suspended animation (in which the passengers are 'frozen' somehow) or Generation ships, in which the vessel is a self-contained colony and the aliens now travelling to earth are descendants of the original crew and passengers. Such a vessel would throughout it's long journey accelerate, until reaching the mid point of the journey before decelerating during the second half of the journey. This may explain why the vessel is still a year away, (which also affords time for the aliens to awaken or mobilise for war). It is also consistent with the fact that the alien technology is not so advanced that humanity can still detect the vessel. It is for these reasons that I suggest the alien vessel is a sleeper/generation ship. In such a situation the continued existence of the aliens is a precarious and uncertain one, they may have been travelling for millions of years, are very lucky to have survived and have nothing to go back for, it is almost certain that their primary goal is to find a world on which to establish a colony. Though alien life may have evolved to any number of enviroments, these aliens have decided to head for earth. Even though they should be aware of the presence of mankind. It is therefore certain they intend to colonise earth. They will know that an industrialised race such as mankind will have used up most of the avaliable living space on their world. They will therefore know that in order to establish a colony they will have to 'displace' the indigenous population, in other words go to war. My opponent may ask, 'why haven't the aliens already nuked us', the reason is that they intend to colonise us with the maximum retention of resources.

859,"Thanks bloodsnhall. Fair enough, I will accept Pro's distinction between real hip hop and commercial, predominantly negative rap, despite how much of a misuse of terms I may feel such a distinction to be. It is good to see that Pro acknowledges the positive aspects of true hip hop culture. Obviously this gives my opponent the opportunity to make a stronger case than if we were including conscious, more positive hip hop, however he still has a lot of work to do with just one round of debating left. I am a little puzzled though by his statements in the comments section referring to the meat of the debate. While the comments should not be considered as part of the actual debate, Pro's comments about what we are arguing need addressing here. Pro: I feel proving that any music genre is a motivator for any crime is irrelevant and that Con misunderstood what's up for debate. I am stating that RAP is a BIGGER motivator to crimanal activity then METAL. This seems somewhat incoherent to me. Before we can establish whether one genre of music is a BIGGER motivator than another, we must first ascertain whether music can ever be a motivator in this way. This is very relevant indeed. Pro seems to be making the assumption that music motivates people to commit crimes, which I don't think is something we can take for granted. To uphold his resolution, Pro really needs to provide evidence of this. Pro: I am not stating that people who listen to metal don't commit crimes. I thought I stated that perfectly clear in round 1. ? I don't believe I implied that you were stating such a thing, and I don't see any reference to it in your round 1 either. Pro: Also to state that no crime has ever been commited because of music is false and I can prove that with one name Charles Manson. The name alone hardy qualifies as proof for the premise. Manson was/is a very mentally unstable individual who had his own motivations for the acts he and his followers committed. The fact that he interpreted certain songs as supporting his views in no way establishes that the songs themselves motivated him to perform atrocities. I think it is probable that Manson would have acted in a similar way, whatever tunes he was blasting on his stereo. Pro: I have also experienced music that has motavated people to commit hate crimes ""black and white"". anyways This type of anecdotal information is absolutely worthless in terms of proving something in the context of a debate. Pro: either way it is besides the point. On the contrary, it is fundamental to the debate at hand. Until Pro can prove that music motivates people to commit crimes and abuse drugs, his arguments are mere conjecture. This is the premise that my opponent's case rests on and I strongly dispute it.

863,"The opponent argues that DDO (debate.org, the site you are currently on) is ""similar to a social network."" This is plainly false. Allow me to elaborate. Social Network - ""An online community of people with a common interest who use a website or other technologies to communicate with each other and share information, resources, etc."" [1] It is clear that DDO is a social network. We are all brought together as an online community with the common interest of ""debate"", as the opponent as admitted. Furthermore, we spend a great deal of time communicating with one another and sharing information. Similar - ""almost the same as someone or something else"" [2] Almost - ""only a little less than"" [3] The definition of similar clearly dictates that for two objects to be similar, they have to be almost the same, but objectively different by ""only a little"". Considering that DDO is a social network, it cannot be said that DDO is ""similar"" to a social network, because that would imply that DDO itself is not a social network. I'll formulate this as a syllogism. Premise 1: DDO is a social network. [Definition of social network.] Premise 2: Two similar objects must differ by ""a little"".

  The opponent argues that DDO (debate.org, the site you are currently on) is ""similar to a social network.""  This is plainly false. Allow me to elaborate.   Social Network - ""An online community of people with a common interest who use a website or other technologies to communicate with each other and share information, resources, etc."" [1]  It is clear that DDO   is   a social network. We are all brought together as an online community with the common interest of ""debate"", as the opponent as admitted. Furthermore, we spend a great deal of time communicating with one another and sharing information.   Similar - ""almost the same as someone or something else"" [2]  Almost - ""only a little less than"" [3]  The definition of similar clearly dictates that for two objects to be similar, they have to be almost the same, but objectively different by ""only a little"". Considering that DDO   is   a social network, it cannot be said that DDO is ""similar"" to a social network, because that would imply that DDO itself is not a social network.   I'll formulate this as a syllogism.   Premise 1: DDO is a social network. [Definition of social network.]  Premise 2: Two similar objects must differ by ""a little"".

I was referring specifically to the wise philosopher Mick Jagger, who surely has a more open mind than a prince who wants to cry about his fake troubles in order to steal the throne. The quote my opponent referred to, however, was a quote by the Rolling Stone's Mick Jagger. These are two very different people, both physically and ideologically. C. Climates.

People won't buy into the idea, thus negating customer satisfaction and a profit. A good idea may not be well executed, yet because the idea is good, you will probably succeed regarding at least one of the two objectives. Example: Say I live in an area where there is a high demand for toy stores, and no demand for shoe stores. Opening up a shoe store would be a bad idea; it would not generate any business no matter how well thought out or executed my business plans may be. Thus, 0 customer satisfaction (demand), therefore 0 profit. If I opened up a toy store; however, but priced my items too high, that would be an example of a good idea (opening up a toy store where there is high demand), but bad execution (high prices). Because there is a high demand directly correlated to the good idea, customers would in fact shop at my store despite their lack of satisfaction. Thus I may have failed in one aspect of my objective, but the profit I would make from the customers (even if there were few of them) would mean that I was successful in at least one of my endeavors.

873,"Although I'm itching to reply to my opponent's arguments in full, I realize he has a lot to respond to, so I'll keep my round to less than 4,000 characters as he requested. 1. Pro has not offered a substantive reply to my claim regarding paternalism. His response demonstrates a misunderstanding of what is intended by the word freedom. Freedom, in the political sense, is the absence of the fraud and initiatory violence. Oliver Wendell Holmes stated it best: ""the right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins."" <URL>... Pro claims that Shari'a prohibits what is harmful and permits what leads to happiness. This response is circular; its merits need to be considered in light my other arguments. He has also ignored the core of my contention: that an individual is the one best qualified to seek after his own happiness. Different things bring different people varying degrees of happiness; it is subjective. In a libertarian society, individuals make their own determinations without others arbitrarily deciding for them what is in their ""best interest."" b. In order to keep my round brief as Pro requested, I won't go into detail about sexist practices in Islam at this time. The fact that men are also oppressed under Islam does not justify the oppression of women; two wrongs do not make a right. I fail to see logic behind taking away a woman's ability to make such a choice for herself in the name of upholding her rights; you cannot increase freedom through use of coercive power! Moreover, in a voluntaryist system, women who see the merits of wearing hijab would do so freely without needing to be forced. Muslims who view with disdain the ""cultural corruption"" of the West would be able to form their own communities, setting their own laws, within which a strict interpretation of Shari'a could be observed. c. Pro's entire response is essentially a bare, unsupported assertion. The only statistic he has cited in ""support"" of his claim is an article explaining that Mecca is giant drug trafficking hub. My contention is rooted in the simple economic principle of supply and demand. The more something is suppressed, the greater the profits involved, this the greater the incentive to break the law. For this simple reason, drug and alcohol use can be slightly hindered, but never eliminated. Driving the trade underground only increases the risks and magnifies the harm done to the individual user. d. I fail to see how offering loans is ""taking money from people who actually need it."" As I explained, banning interest only constricts the availability of funds. My opponent also fallaciously sees finance as a zero-sum game. <URL>... By putting the loan to use, say, to start a business or to buy something now rather than having to save and wait until later, the borrower benefits; by receiving interest, the lender benefits and overall prosperity increases. 2. I understand the difficulties that early Muslims had to contend with, and while I sympathize with my opponent's point of view, I fail to see how this justifies punishing apostates with death. On the contrary, this is just as unfair and tyrannical as the suppression of Islam in the past. Moreover, without a compelling case for Divine Command Theory and divine revelation of the Qu'ran, such preferential treatment for Islam is extremely unfair and arbitrary. b. Even if, as my opponent claims, ""eye for an eye"" punishment is rare, the fact that it is allowed at all is a perversion of justice. Pro also has yet to fully address the moral reasoning behind my opposition to retributive punishment schemes. == CONCLUSION == As I stated earlier, I've kept this round brief at my opponent's request so as to allow him to build his case in support of divine revelation and Divine Command Theory, which I'll respond to in my last round. I feel this is the most crucial part of the debate and look forward to seeing how Pro attempts this. The resolution is negated.",1,J.Kenyon,"

Pro claims that Shari'a prohibits what is harmful and permits what leads to happiness. This response is circular; its merits need to be considered in light my other arguments. He has also ignored the core of my contention: that an individual is the one best qualified to seek after his own happiness. Different things bring different people varying degrees of happiness; it is subjective. In a libertarian society, individuals make their own determinations without others arbitrarily deciding for them what is in their ""best interest.""  
  
b. In order to keep my round brief as Pro requested, I won't go into detail about sexist practices in Islam at this time. The fact that men are also oppressed under Islam does not justify the oppression of women; two wrongs do not make a right. I fail to see logic behind taking away a woman's ability to make such a choice for herself in the name of upholding her rights; you cannot increase freedom through use of coercive power! Moreover, in a voluntaryist system, women who see the merits of wearing hijab would do so freely without needing to be forced. Muslims who view with disdain the ""cultural corruption"" of the West would be able to form their own communities, setting their own laws, within which a strict interpretation of Shari'a could be observed.  
  
c. Pro's entire response is essentially a bare, unsupported assertion. The only statistic he has cited in ""support"" of his claim is an article explaining that Mecca is giant drug trafficking hub. My contention is rooted in the simple economic principle of supply and demand. The more something is suppressed, the greater the profits involved, this the greater the incentive to break the law. For this simple reason, drug and alcohol use can be slightly hindered, but never eliminated. Driving the trade underground only increases the risks and magnifies the harm done to the individual user.  
  
d. I fail to see how offering loans is ""taking money from people who actually need it."" As I explained, banning interest only constricts the availability of funds. My opponent also fallaciously sees finance as a zero-sum game.   http://www.wordiq.com...   By putting the loan to use, say, to start a business or to buy something now rather than having to save and wait until later, the borrower benefits; by receiving interest, the lender benefits and overall prosperity increases.  
  
2. I understand the difficulties that early Muslims had to contend with, and while I sympathize with my opponent's point of view, I fail to see how this justifies punishing apostates with death. On the contrary, this is just as unfair and tyrannical as the suppression of Islam in the past. Moreover, without a compelling case for Divine Command Theory and divine revelation of the Qu'ran, such preferential treatment for Islam is extremely unfair and arbitrary.  
  
b. Even if, as my opponent claims, ""eye for an eye"" punishment is rare, the fact that it is allowed at all is a perversion of justice. Pro also has yet to fully address the moral reasoning behind my opposition to retributive punishment schemes.  
  
== CONCLUSION ==  
  
As I stated earlier, I've kept this round brief at my opponent's request so as to allow him to build his case in support of divine revelation and Divine Command Theory, which I'll respond to in my last round. I feel this is the most crucial part of the debate and look forward to seeing how Pro attempts this.

876,"Omnipotence As stated in the first round, my main contention against pro's proof will be that the defined God is necessarily impossible to disprove, at the very least via natural selection. That's because pro has attributed him with the property of being able to actualize any logical fact. In other words, he would have the ability to make square circles exist. This is in contrast to the more common theistic conceptions of omnipotence where God only has the ability to do everything within logic but not the illogical as well (such as making square circles). I however won't contend with the definition as I think natural selection fails to disprove God whichever one we take. Though I have not yet offered my argument, pro has chosen to predict my reasoning and try to refute it himself last round. I think it's important to note, we are taking this particular conception of God as a hypothetical. Pro says that my argument would presuppose God in my proving you can't disprove him, thus resulting in my making a fallacious argument. That however is not the case as my argument forms as a hypothetical. As an atheist, I do not even believe in God. I can talk about what certain conceptions of God could do. It's not the same as saying what a god does or will do . Now, I think pro is taking on a completely futile task. He's trying to refute an irrefutable concept. The way he's defined God, makes that God irrefutable. He's thus defeated himself in his definition. It doesn't matter whether this God exists or not as this is just hypothetical. I could define something as a magical fairy that changes logic every time someone tries to disprove it, resulting in nothing being able to refute it. Even though that being likely does not exist, you cannot prove that it doesn't exist because it, by definition, is irrefutable. In fact I could make up any concept and add in the definition that it is irrefutable, and there is no way to refute it. It's by definition impossible for me to refute irrefutable things. That's not to say there's anything to support the existence of these things. While you cannot disprove God, theists still have the burden of proving his existence, which I personally believe they have always failed to do. I am not defending the existence of God here. The particular attribute that makes the God we are discussing irrefutable is, as stated, that it can actualize any logical fact. Pro's whole argument rests on the joint attribute that God is all good. An all good God would not use the non-good process of natural selection since he's omnipotent and thus doesn't have to. That is the crux of pro's case. However since this God could actualize any facts, you can't disprove him with natural selection or anything. He's necessarily exempt from logical paradoxes or contradictions with his character. Pro finds natural selection contradictory with an all-good infinite intelligence. But as the defined God would be able to make square circles, he could also dispel this contradiction. An absolute omnipotence could change both logic and morality. He by definition is above them. Therefore, whatever makes natural selection bad, God could make good since God is above morality according to pro. So God could remain all good by making the act which he is committing good. If pro were to say that God could not make natural selection good, then he's limiting the God he's already defined as unlimited. He can't have it both ways. Furthermore, this God could dispel the logical contradiction of an all good being doing bad things. In other words, even if God is all good and natural selection is immoral, the only thing preventing the two from not clashing is the logical principle of contradiction. God, by pros definition, is above logic and thus could change the laws of contradiction so that he could be both good while doing bad. Summer y Pro has taken on the very futile task of trying to prove the non-existence of a being that is by definition irrefutable. You cannot disprove the God that pro has defined because this God is able to actualize any moral facts as well as logical facts. Whatever moral or logical arguments pro uses to disprove this God thus fail because logic and morality don't bind this God. So pro has defined God as irrefutable then tried to refute him; obviously not something anyone can complete. So just to summarize all pros contentions as I went somewhat out of order, (1) I do believe in natural selection and evolution, so pro has no need to make an argument for it. (2) The nature of natural selection as we perceive it is irrelevant because it's not binding to the God that pro's defined. (3) This type of theism is not contradictory because contradictions cannot apply to the God pro has defined, whether they be moral or logical. I'll hand it back to pro now.",1,phantom,"

Both want to keep troops in 160 countries and rob the U.S. taxpayer to pay for the defense of Japan, Israel, South Korea, Europe, etc. spending: They both run up huge deficits, funded by the printing of more fiat money. Historically, government has grown slower when Democrats have been in office.

The deficit spending the Republicans love is immoral to the core. life: Abortion? There is no difference between the Democrats and Republicans -- they both think abortion should be decided by the federal government, not the states (as the Constitution says it should). Furthermore, neither party is really against abortion. They use it as a political prop. Congress determines the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and Ron Paul has a bill that would strip federal jurisdiction on abortion, but none of your ""abortion is murder!"" representatives are interested. liberty: Give me a break.

897,"I thank truth_seeker for accepting this debate and look forward to an interesting discussion. Argument My opening will be brief. Essentially, the morality of this story is inconclusive...it is not possible to conclude that either party did what was ""right"" to earn the favor of the Biblical God, either because 1) we cannot fathom God's will, or 2) the Christian God is not omnibenevolent (thus rendering the Biblical conception of morality to be false). Because the morality is arbitrary, God's favor is also arbitrary. What is not arbitrary is the Biblical description of human nature, and it is this nature that compels Cain to kill Abel, and would compel Abel to kill Cain had God favored Cain. Morality is Inconclusive In Genesis 1, God said, ""I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food."" (Genesis 1:29) God did NOT grant animals for human consumption, yet Abel tends to flocks and sees fit to butcher "" fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock"" to offer to God as sacrifice. (Genesis 4:4) Cain on the other hand offers what was given to him as food (i.e. plants) as an offering to God. For some unexplained reason, God saw fit to look upon Abel the butcher with favor, even though what Abel did to his flocks also would have resulted in ""[the firstborn of his flock's] blood [crying] out to [God] from the ground"" (Genesis 4:10). What makes the butchering of animals different on a moral basis from the butchering of humans in the eyes of God is unexplained. What is clear though is that man was not to eat the flesh of animals, so for Abel to tend flocks with any sort of flesh-related purpose is at best morally ambiguous, at worst a Biblical contradiction. In the end, it is not possible to say why Abel was looked upon with favor...the decision by God is arbitrary at best, contradictory at worst. The Name of Cain The name ""Cain"" means ""to acquire."" [1, 2] The movie Noah made a big point about this, as Cain's successor Tubal-Cain utters more than once ""[God] cursed us to struggle by the sweat of our brow to survive. Damned if I don't do everything it takes to do just that. Damned if I don't take what I want."" ( <URL>... ) A probable moral to the story is that Cain ""took"" from Abel God's favor by killing him, or so he thought, and that such taking is inherently sinful. However, was Cain and ONLY Cain ""destined"" to do this, or could Abel have done this as well? There is no reason to think that Abel was incapable of doing so...after all, both Adam and Eve sought to acquire knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden. Thus this ""sin"", this act of acquisition and the desire that drives it, is ubiquitous in humanity, according to the Bible. Had God favored Cain and not Abel, there is every reason to think that Abel would have done the exact same thing Cain had done to ""acquire"" God's favor from the favored sibling - it is human nature, according to the Bible. Conclusion According to the Bible, man is sinful. According to Christ, not one of us is without sin (John 8:7). According to Genesis, sin is very closely linked to the act of acquisition. The consequences sinning were not known at the time of Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel, and so upon describing two scenarios that involved the desire for acquisition (the original sin and Cain and Abel), man in both cases ""falls"" by sinning. It is not explained why acquiring the knowledge of good and evil and becoming ""as one of us [i.e. like God], to know good and evil"" (Genesis 3:22), is a sin to begin with, and it is not explained why God favored Abel over Cain. At best, moral conclusions from these stories are arbitrary, and thus, given the Biblical account of human nature, any human would have done as Cain had done in his situation, meaning thus that Abel would have killed Cain had God favored Cain.

  I thank truth_seeker for accepting this debate and look forward to an interesting discussion.  Argument  My opening will be brief.  Essentially, the morality of this story is inconclusive...it is not possible to conclude that either party did what was ""right"" to earn the favor of the Biblical God, either because 1) we cannot fathom God's will, or 2) the Christian God is not omnibenevolent (thus rendering the Biblical conception of morality to be false).  Because the morality is arbitrary, God's favor is also arbitrary.  What is not arbitrary is the Biblical description of human nature, and it is this nature that compels Cain to kill Abel, and would compel Abel to kill Cain had God favored Cain.  Morality is Inconclusive  In Genesis 1, God said,   “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.""

""Ok, lets get start again by saying the Koran clearly speaks out against premptive attacks but allows self-defense.""  
  
Surah 2:190---  
""Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you. And slay them wherever you catch them.""  
  
This proves otherwise.  
  
""They attack others in cold blood and some how take scriptures out of context to justify it.""  
  
I have quoted a former Muslim saying ""It is difficult to take the Qur'an out of context"". You said nothing about this.  
  
""Now when the Christian kills a doctor they say 'I'm doing this for Jesus'.""  
  
I think this whole argument is utterly ridiculous. God cammands peoples to be killed in the Old Testament, but only those who have done something judicially wrong in the New Testament. Allah command people to be slayed througout the Qu'ran. The two are not comparable. ANYONE who says that they are murdering in the name of God is a liar.

907,"I would like to thank my opponent for a great debate. She turned out to be quite the opponent. 1.Popular Vote vs. Equality In order for this to be true my opponent would have needed to substantiate that there was inequality. Heterosexuals and homosexuals have equal rights. Every person has the right to marry one person of the opposite sex. We HAVE equal protection under the law. I am not permitted to have multiple wives, just like a wannabe polygamous is not permitted to have multiple wives. I cannot marry a man, nor can someone who wants to marry a man. I cannot have sex with an animal (at least in my particular province), just like a zoophile cannot. I cannot have sex with children, and neither can a pedophile. This IS the definition of equal. My opponent is comparing gay marriage to African American rights. This is not analogous and therefore irrelevant. Homosexuality is not innate, but research tends to agree that homosexuality is a learned behavior (1). Gay marriage should not be nationally imposed because it would have to circumvent our current legal system in order to do so. 2.Definition of equality My opponent's definition of equality is not a recognized definition of equal and is logically unstable. She insists that we cannot ""deny someone something because they aren't exactly like [me]."" Such a definition insists that we grant all things to all people - as we will find that no two people are alike. Our current marriage laws are equal in terms of rights. Every individual as the exact same right to marry one individual of the opposite sex. 3.Homosexuality is innate So my opponent's presumption is that because she has seen no evidence to the contrary, that the weak and untenable correlation should be presumed as proof? Would my opponent similarly expect, if no evidence to the contrary has yet been displayed, that climate change is the result of a decrease in pirates? I certainly expect not. No current research comes close to supplying evidence to substantiate the claim (2). The source she gave only supplies a weak correlation and does not account for lesbianism. If indeed homosexuality was innate, it is quite strange that there would be ex-homosexuals(3). 4.Children and Animals cannot give consent You are using the law (of contractual consent) to unquestionably condemn some issues (pedophilia and zoophilia), yet you are condemning the law on other issues (its non-allowance of gay marriage). Where is the warrant for age of consent? Children ARE capable of giving consent - and very often do (adoptions for instance). You call my equivocation abhorrent without proving it as such. Male animals can give consent - and many female animals (the female dolphin for instance) will give signals of consent when they are ready to mate (4). 5.Polygamy and Polyandry My opponent suggests that it would be a blatant cheating of the law to allow 3 or 4 consenting individuals, who deeply love one another, to marry. But it is apparently no cheating of the law to completely circumvent our legal system to establish nationally recognized gay marriage. Can we not change tax laws in regards to individuals with multiple spouses - that does not seem too hard. Not allowing polygamy and polyandry spits in the face of my opponent's definition of equality. 6.Education My opponent does not care that schools would be forced to revamp education in order to support a lifestyle that is against the will of the people. My opponent believes that teaching students that a relationship between a man and a woman - a biologically and anatomically attested match - is homophobic propaganda. Now if she was told, a few days from now, that schools have decided to teach and support pedophilia (but they took the stand of affirming that the child must be of at least age 10), would she not rightly be angry? Angry because she feels it to be wrong and because the majority of other people feel it to be wrong, but, in spite of it all, they went along and did it anyway? I would be angry too.

909,"Well, that was a rather short argument (as well as fallacious). Let's start by establishing a few things. 1. The definition of communism: 'Any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods' [1] 2. Let me explain the natural progression of society, something that Marx called historical determinism. You see; society always moves in the way that is driven by social change and class struggle. Preceding communism is socialism, which is the system that you (although poorly) described above. Everything is put into the collective; however, your assertion that the people will abuse it is preposterous. All holdings are put into the collective on the part of the state, the state collectivizes all means of production, enabling for the workers to access it. This simply means that the workers would own the means of production through the state. This simply means that everyone would own everything together. Communism is a period that is enacted after socialism has done its job (collectivizing the means of production). Communism is the final period of social liberation, the final step of historical development. In communism, the state slowly withers away as class struggles are abolished. There has never been, and there never will be, a communist state, because communism entails the absence of a state as a repressive instrument of the bourgeois. A communist state cannot exist as that is in and of itself a contradiction. There can not be a period of communism so long as there is a state. 3. Now we come to the main argument that the right-wing laissez-faire capitalists like you tend to make: 'Everyone receives the same salary' This is absurd. Communism and socialism both entail that the means of production belong to society, not the wealthy bourgeois. Now, I agree, since private property is abolished so is the chance of making extraordinary amounts of wealth. But those amounts are not needed in communist society: in communist society, there is not currency. What you are referring to is socialism. The resolution is fallacious on its own. Doctors will still make more than sanitation workers; Why? Because they put more into the collective and they get more out of the collective.

That's it for the refutation, now let's get into why capitalism doesn't work and why socialism-communism is an ideal solution. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. The contradictions of exchange and use values. Commodities are produced for their use value and yet distributed for their exchange value. In other (simpler) words, you produce a loaf of bread for someone to buy it and then eat it. You produce it so someone will buy it and they buy it so they can eat it. 2. The law of value creates exploitation. As labour is not inherently worth anything on its own, it must go into the production of commodities, which are worthless without labour. Labour's worth adheres to the worth of commodities and vice versa. Human labour has no value on its own. I hope you can refute this argument. Judging from your first argument I assume you're new.

Even if students are taught six or seven subjects in public school by ""qualified"" teachers, what exactly does this ""teaching"" consist of?

Moreover, a parent can hire a low-cost college student or tutor to teach their child any subject whose complexity goes beyond the parent's particular knowledge at the time.

In homeschooling, parents who love their kids pay much more attention to each individual student's abilities and likes and dislikes regarding the subjects they enjoy learning.

Thus, in an electoral sense, an independent / Libertarian Ron Paul will neither hurt nor help the GOP in 2008 -- the Republicans will be doomed whether he runs or sits out. It makes virtually zero difference to me who the president is if it's not Ron Paul. The most fundamental political issue of our time is the Federal Reserve and the coming dollar crisis, and every single other candidate -- from Fred Thompson to Dennis Kucinich and everyone in between -- is in unanimity on that issue.

927,"I am proving that the second color group, which includes Oriental, Vermont and Connecticut Avenues, are the best properties in the game. The reasons for this are the following: 1) The Initial Cost - the initial cost of there three properties is very low compared to almost every other property. This alone lets you save up money to purchase houses and hotels, which brings me to my next point. 2) The Price of Houses and Hotels - the price of houses and hotels, used to increase the cost of rent, is only $50 per house. Needing to buy 5 houses to receive a hotel, and there being three properties in the monopoly group, the total cost for building a hotel on each property is a $750. Compared to the next group, the purple, which is $1500 for hotels, is very cheap. One would assume, if the properties were of equal value, that if the cost of building for one group is doubled to reach the cost of building for the second (750*2=1500), then the total rent of the first group should be doubled to reach the second. In this case, the total rent, with hotels, for the light blue properties is $1700, then the total rent, with hotels, for the purple properties should be $3400. Actually the total rent is $2400, $1000 less than what it should be if the properties are equal. 3) Location - the location of these properties is just another reason why these are the best properties. You start the game at ""Go"" and roll two six sided die. There are 21 possibilities, (1-1, 1-2 etc.) not including repeats (1-2 and 2-1). Using these die, there are 8 ways to reach one of the properties (1-5, 2-4, 2-6, 3-3, 3-5, 3-6, 4-4 and 4-5). Almost 40% of the rolls starting at ""Go"" will land on one of these three properties. In addition to this, there are 4 Chance or Community Chest cards that send you to properties (not Railroads or Utilities).

931,"EFFICIENCY My opponent says in his response that since you get to see less splits in Cross Country, you're more likely to run faster, because you're less sure of your pace. ""For me, when I have a set pace i simply try and match that pace. If I do not have a set pace, I simply push myself and try for the best possible time."" Here my opponent cites a personal example of his running, which does violate the universal rule. Aside from that though, he has omitted to mention the downside to what he considers to be his better running style, one which he associates with Cross. Simply pushing yourself and trying for the best time, without using a pace whatsoever (which my opponent insinuates here), can easily lead to you pushing yourself at a pace that causes you to tire out majorly, and then leads to an overall slower time than what you could've had if you had chosen a pace that you could hold all the way through, but just barely. Additionally, my opponent is omitting the fact that just because one has more splits taken while running on a track, that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to push yourself less. Runners know their bodies. If they set out at a pace and realize they're feeling great, they can go ahead and try to go faster than their predicted pace. Also omitted is the fact that in Track you aren't necessarily using your splits to run a pace, you could be using your splits to stay ahead of a pace. If you know what your splits are from a previous race, you can try to be ahead of them in your next race in order to improve your finishing time. This involves pushing oneself, just like in CC. Bottom line, the fact that there are more splits and precision in Track does not mean that you'll be pushing yourself less. Splits are often a guideline to success. Splits are used the same way in both sports, but in Track you can use them more, thus benefiting you as a runner. 400 METER OVAL ""There are more distance that you run, but once you strip Track down to the bare bones, the only difference between races is how many times you run around the same oval."" I can't believe that my opponent actually believes this, as he runs Track. While it is true that ONE of the differences between the different events is the distance, there is another factor, and that is speed. If you're running less laps, you'll be running way faster. It creates a different dynamic to each race, and gives each racer of the different events a specific respectability. 800 meter runners don't want to do the 2 mile because of its distance, and 2 mile runners don't want to do the 800 meter because of the sheer speed and guts it takes to run that race. COURSES I concede the point that the Cross Country courses have more variety, I would like to provide Cons that outweigh the Pro. First , Cross Country courses are easily affected by weather, and in a negative way. If it rains, the courses get muddy, and when the courses get muddy, you get less traction, and thus run slower, through no fault of your own. You could be having the best race of your career, but thanks to a crappy course, you could end up with a non-PR day. How would that be fair? Second , Cross Country courses are inconsistent. Again, you could be having the best race of your career, but you could be on an extremely hilly course, and just like that, what could have been a new personal record is now just a par for the course finish time. Third , there can be errors in course marking and length. Unlike the universally sized track, a Cross Country course is usually mapped by a guy with a tape measurer. He can be off by only .03 miles, but that still affects peoples' times by several seconds. One can falsely be led to believe they're faster than they are, or slower than they are, depending on the errors in course-making. EXCITEMENT ""I had a track meet once where I didn't get home until 9:30 (The meet started at 3:30). Some people are finished all of their races before 6:00, but they still have to sit around waiting while the rest of the team runs."" They can do more than that. They can talk with their friends. Anyone who has ran a race before knows that after a race, one usually feels a little more giddy than usual. So if you've run your race, and you're hanging with your friends, you'll be having a great time. Not only that, but you can cheer on other runners as they do their events. As I mentioned earlier (and this went un-refuted by my opponent too), in Track there's a running tally kept of the score, and so each race you watch bears more and more importance as the time dwindles for your team to secure the winning spot. Additionally, if you really don't want to hang with your friends or support them as they run, you can just leave, usually. Most teams let their runners go after their events are done, as long as a parent signs a sign-out sheet (or they're 18+). ""I'll usually run with my one friend during Cross..""

Because I agree with this quote I negate the resolution: Direct popular vote should replace the electoral college in United States presidential elections for the following reasons. Direct popular vote goes against the intent of the Constituiton and it protects the rights of small states. For the purposes of today's debate I would like to provide the following definitions: Democracy: rule by the majority (merriam webster dictionary) Republic: A political order in which the supreme power lies in a body of citizens who are entitled to vote for officers and representatives responsible to them. (the free dictionary.com) Contention 1: Direct popular vote goes against the original intent of the Constituion and the Founding Fathers. Direct popular vote should not replace the electoral college because it is a step of democratization for the United States. Supporters of direct popular vote argue that democratization is desirable. However, it is the opposite. Joe Wolverton author of The New American says, ""any democratization of the presidential election process is an affront to the express intent of our Founders. The men who constructed our federal government zealously guarded against permitting the harmful influence of democracy to infect the inner workings of our nation."" The United States should not taking steps towards democracy because America is not a democracy for good reason. Alexander Hamilton once said, ""We are a Republican government, real liberty is never found in despotism of the extremes of democracy."" Any form of democracy within the U.S is not disirable. The John Birch Society's documentary, Overview of America, affirms this by saying, ""Democracy itself is not a stable form of government, instead it is the gradual transition from a limited government to the unlimited rule of an oligarchy."" Any form of democracy is not desirable because it assists in the Gradual destruction of a republican government like that of the United States and turns it into a governmental rule of the few that denies individual liberties. Contention 2: The electoral college protects small states influence within the presidential elections. According to Kristina Dell, ""with a direct popular vote...the selection of the president would often be the biggest, most populous states with little attention paid to smaller ones."" Without the electoral college the voices of small states would be drowned out by the larger ones. Bob Nutting of the Maine House Republicans says, ""In the election of 2008, because all votes in the electoral college are important, Maine saw candidates and their surrogates. If the criteria for winning were the popular vote, they would have camped out in California, Texas, New York, Florida and other populous states."" The electoral college is a necessity in order to give small states the right to have a voice in presidential elections which is why i urge a negative ballot for today's debate. And now to attack my opponents case: In response to his first contention sub-point A, he says that ""the electoral college produces an unfair scenario in favor of small states."" However, without the electoral college, the small states would get no say in presidential elections at all, they would be drowned out by the larger states (see second contention). He also says that ""free and fair election is an imperative condition that a democracy must have as a foundation. However, as i proved in my first contention America isnt even a democracy, so obviously this point doesnt stand. In response to his first contention sub-point B, he basically says that the distortion of the electoral college must be solved, but this isnt true since the distortion was specifically put in place to create ""free and fair elections"" with regards to equality of states. In his second contention he says the electors that are voted for by the people can go against the popular vote of their state. However, according to U.S. Electoral College FAQ's ""Throughout our history as a nation, more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged(1)."" Which means that electors voting against their states is the exception to the rule. Also, according to Joe Wolverton, ""In the ease of the Electoral College, the Founders inteded the electors to be a deliberative convention of wise men brought together for the sole purpose of soberly choosing a President form among the available candidates."" This shows that the intent of the Founders was to trust electors more than the people to choose the President. In his second contention sub-point A, he says that direct popular vote fixes the problem of faithless electors Dramatically change the outcome of Presidential elections. However, how can faithless electors ""dramatically"" change elections if they only occur 1 percent of the time? He also states that ""the election needs to be put back in the hands of the people for which it was intended."" However, the original intention was for the electors to elect the president not the people. The people only influence who the electors will vote for. In his third contention he says that because of the electoral college, candidates focus all their attention on a few batleground states; however, as I stated in my second contention if direct popular vote decided presidential elections, then candidates wouldnt need to pay attention to small states, only large ones with high populations which means that although the electoral college doesnt solve the problem of candidates ignoring certain states, neither does direct popular vote which means that this contention doesnt prove why direct popular vote should replace the electoral college.

944,"Starting off with some refutation: 1. Genetic disorders past on through gender If parents have genetic disorders, they can simply choose not to have children or adopt instead. This is what is happening now, and it works fine, and people are satisfied. There is no reason to push for the legalization of choosing your child's sex, as it will have much more disadvantages than advantages, which I will get into detail later. 2. Cultural gender bias That is exactly the problem. Don't you see, if everyone has a bias towards males, for example, that everyone will want a male baby? This would vastly increase the population of males over those of females, and this could lead to some serious problems. In fact, this is the current state of China, and there are not enough women to go around as brides. If we continute to allow familes to have this gender bias, we are building towards an unequal society. When one gender vastly out-populates another, many problems would arise and get worse, such as discrimination or sexism towards the minority gender. When we make gender selection so easy and accessible by the public, everyone will start using it. Look at the number of chinese familes in the world. They outnumber many other races. As such, there will be a massive overload of males, and not enough females. This is not ideal. It would also harm human growth, as with a majority of a specific gender, reproduction will slow down. Furthermore, your argument does make any sense. You talk about the prevention of abandonment. But there are solutions to preventing child birth, such as birth control or abortion (when you find out it is the opposite gender of what you wish). That is what we should be promoting instead. This also solves the issue you are talking about, and we don't need to bring in gender selection. Thus, gender selection offers no additional benefits. 3. A better life for a wanted child Again, ultrasound can be used to determine gender, and abortion can be used to abort the gender they dislike and they can try again. if the parents have their heart so set on a specific gender, that you make it out to be, then they would obviously try to do everything in their power to achieve that gender. Abortion is the solution, not this gender selection process. Now, you may argue that abortion kills the fetus, and causes pain and harm to the baby. This is true. But is this any better than your proposed gender selection solution? You don't know whether or not gender selection causes harm to the baby or kills the fetus. It may even cause the same physical pain as abortion. As such, again, it offers no extra benefits, and there is no reason to introduce it. You may also say that abortion puts the baby through pain, and mothers don't want that. However, you previously mentioned that when mothers have their heart set on a specific gender, it usually creates an unwanted child. Would this not also create emotional pain on the child? Who are you to decide which pain is worse? 4. Choice , Not on a small scale, no. But multiply that by the millions of families on this planet, and it does cause a detriment to our global society. 5. Other small points 5a. Hello adoption? Also, I would think that if a family miscarried a child, they would refrain from another child from fear of having another miscarriage. They wouldn't jump right into another child straight away. 5b. Yeah, I agree. But you can't say for sure that it will not cause physical pain to the child. As such, we should stay away from gender selection because of this risk. Points I outlined alot of my points in my refutation, about the possibility of a specific gender dominated society, and the risk of discrimination. I also outlined the risk to the human race, as reproduction will slow down vastly. I also stated how it could cause possible damage to the baby, and we should not take that risk.",1,Hardcore.Pwnography,"
  
  Starting off with some refutation:  1. Genetic disorders past on through gender  If parents have genetic disorders, they can simply choose not to have children or adopt instead. This is what is happening now, and it works fine, and people are satisfied. There is no reason to push for the legalization of choosing your child's sex, as it will have much more disadvantages than advantages, which I will get into detail later.  2. Cultural gender bias  That is exactly the problem. Don't you see, if everyone has a bias towards males, for example, that everyone will want a male baby? This would vastly increase the population of males over those of females, and this could lead to some serious problems. In fact, this is the current state of China, and there are not enough women to go around as brides.  If we continute to allow familes to have this gender bias, we are building towards an unequal society. When one gender vastly out-populates another, many problems would arise and get worse, such as discrimination or sexism towards the minority gender. When we make gender selection so easy and accessible by the public, everyone will start using it. Look at the number of chinese familes in the world. They outnumber many other races. As such, there will be a massive overload of males, and not enough females. This is not ideal. It would also harm human growth, as with a majority of a specific gender, reproduction will slow down.

God is complex and requires a complex definition, so I quote the Westminster Confession of Faith [1]: ----- There is but one only, living, and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions; immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute; working all things according to the counsel of His own immutable and most righteous will, for His own glory; most loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him; and withal, most just, and terrible in His judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty. God has all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in and of Himself; and is alone in and unto Himself all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which He has made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting His own glory in, by, unto, and upon them. He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and has most sovereign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them whatsoever Himself pleases. In His sight all things are open and manifest, His knowledge is infinite, infallible, and independent upon the creature, so as nothing is to Him contingent, or uncertain. He is most holy in all His counsels, in all His works, and in all His commands. To Him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience He is pleased to require of them. In the unity of the Godhead there be three Persons of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. The Father is of none, neither begotten nor proceeding; the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; the Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. ----- I will put forth one argument as I am certain this single argument will require ever increasing amounts of exposition, and I wouldn't want to compete for space with other arguments. Moreover, I very much enjoy this argument as it is not as well known as the other common ones. The argument I propose is the Transcendental Argument for God's Existence, or TAG [2], and I stand in affirmation that the argument is valid. The argument begins with the premise that truth is objective. Truth, being that which affirms reality as it is, is the desired goal of academic pursuit. Debate falls within this pursuit, and it stands to reasons that, if debate is not seeking objective truth, then it is a vain endeavor. For this reason, strong agnosticism and other forms of skepticism are refuted at the outset on the basis that they are self-refuting and lead to absurdity. The claim that truth is not objective is itself an objective truth claim and can only be true if it is false. To obtain objective truth, academic pursuit relies on the principle that logical reasoning, scientific induction, and moral obligation are all capable of attaining objective truth. In order to do so, these principles, which are often taken for granted, must be abstract and absolute, as anything else reduces to absurdity. If logical reasoning is conventional, then it cannot affirm anything more than conventional knowledge. If nature is not uniform, then science cannot affirm anything more than present observations. If morality is subjective, then it cannot affirm anything more than ethical suggestions. In short, unless these principles are universally binding and abstractly independent from human thought, all debate philosophically leads to utter skepticism. So, for debate to be intelligible, logic must be necessarily true, the universe must be uniform, and morality must be universally binding. TAG asserts that God (as defined herein) is the necessary precondition for these principles, and is proved via the impossibility of the contrary. This God is the only precondition that can justify immutable logic, uniformity in nature, and moral objectivity, for He is perfectly true, immutable, transcendent, righteous, holy, infinite, and so forth. Without Him, these principles cannot exist in the state in which debate requires them. That is to say, without God, logic becomes conventional, scientific induction becomes unreliable, and morality becomes mere opinion, which brings us back to the problem described in the preceding paragraph. The result is that any debater attempting to disprove God ultimately relies on principles that can only be justified if his/her position is wrong. To say it very succinctly, God exists because without His existence it is impossible to know anything. I'll close my opening round here and allow my opponent to offer rebuttals.

Alright. Before I start, I will answer my opponent's questions.  
  
1. Yes, that is a pretty accurate description of what I mean by song. Also, I would include instrumental quality in there, especially because we are both using bands.  
  
2. You can describe the song. However. The descriptions should be fairly brief, and the main case/argument should be the song, not the description.  
  
3. You can only diss your opponent's song with a song by the artist you chose.  
  
Also, I should clarify that only studio recordings count. You can't use a live performance.  
  
So, let's begin!  
  
Here's a good song to start off things with...  
  
We Will Rock You  
  
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise  
  
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day  
You got mud on your face  
You big disgrace  
Kickin' your can all over the place  
Sing it!  
  
We will we will rock you  
We will we will rock you  
  
Buddy you're a young man hard man  
Shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world some day  
You got blood on your face  
You big disgrace  
Wavin' your banner all over the place  
  
We will we will rock you

We will we will rock you  
  
Buddy you're an old man poor man  
Pleadin' with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day  
You got mud on your face

Sing it  
We will we will rock you  
Everybody  
We will we will rock you  
We will we will rock you  
Alright  
[guitar riff]  
  
Here's another good opening song.  
  
Another One Bites the Dust  
  
Oh! Lets go!  
Steve walks warily down the street  
With the brim pulled way down low  
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,  
Machine guns ready to go  
Are you ready, hey are you ready for this?  
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?  
Out of the doorway the bullets rip,

Another one bites the dust

Another one bites the dust  
  
How do you think I'm gonna get along,  
Without you when your gone?  
You took me for everything that i had,  
And kicked me out on my own  
  
Are you happy? Are you satisfied?  
How long can you stand the heat?

Thank you for accepting and I would like to open up first. INTRO: ""Like the dusty blackboards still found in some school classrooms, the single-salary schedule has served its purposes and outlived its usefulness."" In response to this need, the authors developed a framework for a performance-pay system that is ""fair, strategic, and likely to win teacher support."" Their recommendations include the following: (1) Reward teachers who help their students make significant academic gains. The research supports plans that measure student gains over time; that recognize both individual and team performance; and that allow schools to use credible data from classroom assessments. (2) Provide more pay for additional degrees and professional development that are relevant to school and district goals. (3) Offer incentives to teachers in low-performing schools but only if those teachers can demonstrate that they are effective with high-needs students and will be able to address the school's specific learning needs. My partner and I stand in affirmation that merit pay based on student achievement should be a significant component of K-12 teacher compensation in United States public schools. DEFINITIONS: Student achievement- Is a term that when applied to merit pay, has various meanings. The two most commonly known are student scores based off of a state test, and the progression of student education in schools that house students that don't normally score high. CONTENTION ONE: Merit Pay is an improvement. A performance pay system will tend to attract and retain individuals who are particularly good at the activity being incentivized and repel those who are not. In 1963, Hoxby and Leigh found, teachers from topnotch colleges earned significantly more than teachers from so-called safety schools. As of 2000, teachers earned the same regardless of their alma mater, the study found. Offering teachers merit pay might lure smart people to the job, Hoxby suggests. The national union's opposition to new forms of compensation is ""wrongheaded,"" said Brad Jupp, a former vice president of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association, an NEA affiliate. Mr. Jupp, now an adviser to the 72,000-student Denver district, helped design an alternative compensation program while he was the Denver union's lead negotiator in 1999. The union agreed to pilot a pay-for-performance plan. The plan, which has since been adopted districtwide, rewards teachers for improving student achievement, choosing to work in hard-to-staff schools, and earning positive appraisals from peer evaluators. CONTENTION TWO: Merit pay gains support from most of America. Barack Obama wants to start a new program supporting an innovative-schools fund that his campaign says would allow districts to create ""portfolios"" of schools modeled after existing success stories. In short, our presidency supports this idea of merit pay. Sens. Norm Coleman, R-Minn., Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., and Joseph I. Lieberman, IConn., and others put forth a proposal this month on major changes to the No Child Left Behind Act that includes incentives for states to look at performance-pay programs to attract teachers to underperforming schools. This shows that merit pay is being recognized at a federal level. 72 percent of respondents say they favor merit pay in general for teachers, with advanced degrees, student test scores, and administrator evaluations ranking as the top measures for assigning raises. Competition is good, not bad. And parents have a right to demand high, measurable performance from those who would teach their children. Lawmakers should listen to the public, with its common sense born of experience, not to the union bosses who want more benefits for less work. Finally, the public demonstrates that they favor merit pay for teachers. CONTENTION THREE: Traditional salaries are ineffective. The chances of a high-performing student becoming a teacher fell from 21% in 1964 to just 11% in 2000, according to a University of Maryland study. Although the obvious culprit is new opportunities, fixed pay in education also contributed to the nosedive, said Caroline Hoxby, a Harvard University researcher who conducted the study with Andrew Leigh. Supporters of merit pay plans believe that the old pay structures are outdated and don't give teachers incentive to achieve or reward good performance. ""Some of our first- and second-year teachers who are at the bottom of the pay scale do brilliant work that often goes unrecognized,"" one younger teacher told us. ""Conversely, there are teachers at the top of the pay scale who have not changed teaching methods in twenty-five years to meet the needs of the kids they work with now.""

As I noted earlier, and as PRO has completely disregarded, new arguments are *not* allowed in the final round of debate. Nevertheless, PRO has opted to lay waste to the ethics of debate. Judges, please bear this in mind when dolling out conduct points. As I also noted in Round 2, I am not obligated, as the person without the burden of proof--and you'll note that PRO never once contested that he had the burden of proof, so it extends through that it lies solely with him--to provide a positive argument. Nevertheless, I have done so, and PRO has completely dropped it. This is even more reason to immediately vote CON. I'm going to rebut PRO's arguments, even though I'm not obligated to at this time since it's, again, illegitimate and unethical to initiate new arguments in the final round of debat.

Not only is there no evidence at all that this actually took place--nor should you buy that it actually did--but this is not in the slightest a rational reason to draw a line in the sand and say ""Do not do X."" Life is not, and need not, be one size fits all, nor can we reason from any particular subjective experence to a general rule. PRO provides only the former and claims it as a basis for the latter, but this cannot possible obtain. Further, he ignores that he's (1) more likely to either not speak with those individuals than to have contentions relations with them; (2) he may in fact befriend them, and again is ""throwing out the baby with the bath water"" by also eshewing any opportunity for friendship; and (3) has several means of recourse--blocking, ""stopping threads"" and deleting the PM conversation, contacting a moderator, etc.--should he feel that a member is harassing them, though again we have no reason to believe that this was the case.

As I also noted in Round 2, I am not obligated, as the person without the burden of proof--and you'll note that PRO never once contested that he had the burden of proof, so it extends through that it lies solely with him--to provide a positive argument. Nevertheless, I have done so, and PRO has completely dropped it. This is even more reason to immediately vote CON.     I'm going to rebut PRO's arguments, even though I'm not obligated to at this time since it's, again, illegitimate and unethical to initiate new arguments in the final round of debat.   PRO states, ""  I would like to base my side of the debate off the fact that in the 50 I've verified my e-mail I have been  interrogated by 3 people, Have been accused of being 2001bhu 6 times and have not been very happy about it! This is to show that you people need to back off  .""     PRO is basing his entire case on his own subjective experience. Not only is there no evidence at all that this actually took place--nor should you buy that it actually did--but this is not in the slightest a rational reason to draw a line in the sand and say ""Do not do X."" Life is not, and need not, be one size fits all, nor can we reason from any particular subjective experence to a general rule. PRO provides only the former and claims it as a basis for the latter, but this cannot possible obtain. Further, he ignores that he's (1) more likely to either not speak with those individuals than to have contentions relations with them; (2) he may in fact befriend them, and again is ""throwing out the baby with the bath water"" by also eshewing any opportunity for friendship; and (3) has several means of recourse--blocking, ""stopping threads"" and deleting the PM conversation, contacting a moderator, etc.--should he feel that a member is harassing them, though again we have no reason to believe that this was the case.  PRO states, ""  Yes I would like to ask that of everyone ealse. Why do you think I am 2001bhu? Why don't you exstend this kind of niceness to me?  ""  This is irrelevant to the debate.   Vote CON.

978,"=Lethality= My opponent ignores the bulk of my argument regarding the harmful effects of a scorpion sting. The crux of my argument revolved around the fact that scorpion stings are more harmful to elderly people and children. I never asserted that scorpion stings are dangerous to everyone but to a certain group of people they can be. The Mayo source was being used to show that if children are stung it is advisable to take them to the hospital. My argument in this, which you have largely ignored, is that this eliminates a group of people - those with small children - from likely owning a scorpion. Mother's are very protective of their kids and won't want something that can lead to a hospital visit living in their house. The resolution is that they are good pets in general. However, they are dangerous to elderly people and young children. My opponent claims I did not adequately cover the pet point but he dropped my claim about elderly and children. My opponent claims that elderly and children only make up 33% of the population but that is 33% of the population who might not want a scorpion living around them. That is 1/3 which would cause scorpions to not be good pets in general. But good pets for middle aged people only. My opponent then claims that scorpions aren't dangerous at all because you shouldn't touch a scorpion at all. Doesn't that eliminate a population of people who want hands on pets? Pets you can touch and deal with? Either you can't touch the scorpion or you touch them and risk getting stung. Either way, those are limiting characteristics. =Ease of Care= I used the Emperor scorpion because they are the the most popular and becoming the most common pet scorpion so actually my facts were more general than yours. If you're going to get a pet scorpion chances are you'll be buying an Emperor Scorpion. [1] If you get a pet scorpion there is a larger chance than not that you'll get an Emperor Scorpion therefore my facts were relevant. Also, my opponent can't even refute the facts other than to try and discredit them meaning he concedes that scorpions are not as easy to care for as he made them out. =Longevity= If you did not want people to assume popular pets are popular because of their life span why did you draw the comparison? Also, I could not find data outside of personal experience and the data I offered earlier. The most popular pets list is sprinkled with long lived pets (cats, dogs etc) and short lived pets (mice, hamsters etc) meaning that there are those who like long lived pets and there are those who enjoy short lived pets. If someone wants a short lived pet they'll most likely not want to buy a scorpion and therefore scorpions exclude another group of pet owners. =Most Popular Pets= Scorpions share very few traits with the pets on the most popular pets list meaning they probably are not a very good general pet. My opponent then states that scorpions are arachnids. Arachnophobia is the fear of arachnids. 50% of all women have Arachnophobia. [2] 10% of all men have Arachnophobia. [2] This excludes a HUGE percentage of the population from owning a scorpion. Even if they aren't bugs persay, they hold many common qualities with bugs in: size shape number of legs type of movement Bugs or not, many people could view them as such. =Conclusion= - Scorpions are dangerous and require medical care if they sting children and elderly people. - Emperor Scorpions are most popular and common scorpion pet type and they are difficult to care for requiring specific humidity and heat needs. - Scorpions are arachnids and exclude many people with arachnophobia. - Scorpions are long living and do not appeal to those who want short lived pets.

981,"In response to my opponent... Please note that you and me agreed upon stating our opening statements in the second round. That counts as my introduction. In my intro, I had no contentions and no observations. So in my defense, you are incorrect. LD clearly states an intro, contentions, and resolution + conclusion. Overall, this is irrelevant to the topic at hand which is supposed to be vigilantism. I sense that this was only a tactic used to forbid me from proving anything else. Anyway, this is not a debate of LD formatting. I will state contentions here... Contention 1: Vigilantism violates the constitution. Through out the years, there have been many cases of vigilantism. After the civil war had ended in the 1800th century, many southerners grouped together and formed the KKK (ku klux klan). They were a vigilante group that caused havoc through out the south. The KKK murdered innocent African American civilians in order to perfect the American way and defend the white race. By doing this, they were held account for multiple cases of murder and for the violation of the civil rights of the people. Many other vigilantes exist today even. For example, the Juarez group is a vigilante group in Mexico who have sworn to kill a criminal a day. They have been doing so for years. Placed in ditches were the heads of their victims. Now, when a police officer kills a criminal, it is because a criminal is armed. Not to mention, they are authorized by law to do so. Vigilantes on the other hand, are not. Most of the Juarez's victims were not armed. The Juarez to have caused multiple cases of murder, violated criminal justice, and also violated the sixth amendment. The sixth amendment clearly states that a criminal has the right for a jury and fair trial. The policy for criminal justice is that you are not guilty until the court says so. Contention 2: Vigilantes cannot be trusted. Vigilantes are anyone outside law enforcement who takes the law into their own hands. By mentioning anyone, this is the key factor of how vigilantism endangers citizens. For example, in Tennessee, their was a man by the name of Timothy Chandler. He was already arrested for child pornography. Two of his neighbors, otherwise known as vigilantes, decided a way of scaring him by setting a fire off near his house. The fire began to grow at a serious and dangerous rate. Mr. Chandler escaped safely but his wife (who was innocent) was killed because of it. Clearly these vigilantes were not aware of the dangers and consequences who ended up with being charged for murder. Therefore, they were not able to be trusted upon. This is a perfect example of the dangers vigilantism can cause. <URL>... I conclude my argument here. Vigilantism is an unconstitutional way of handling the law. Vigilantes like said before, cannot be trusted upon. They are an unreliable source for enforcing the law. Vigilantes are a threat to the people of society. I and many others have not been able to understand how vigilantism can be justified. If professional and trained law officers have failed to enforce the law, what makes anyone think that a group of civilians would do a better job than that of an officer? My resolution is simple, possible, and absolutely more effective than justifying vigilantism. It is the government's job to protect the people of it's country. If the government has failed to enforce the law, then they should simply act upon it. By this I mean reformatting the law enforcement agencies. Simply cops who are unable to do their job should be replaced with more highly effective officers and agents. Regardless whether vigilantism or reformation is more effective, it is fact that either way, there is always going to be crime out there. It is not up to a civilian to decide to take on the law without being trained or being authorized by the government to do so. I conclude my argument and thank my opponent again for this opportunity....",1,heyitsjay,"

Introduction  
=============  
  
I would like to thank abard123 for beginning this fascinating debate! I hope we can enjoy ourselves and also encourage further inquiry into this very intriguing topic.  
  
My opponent beings his argument by pointing out that, over the millennia, many societies formulated hypotheses for the sole purpose of filling in the blanks. The argument that he is trying to make – and he can correct me where I err – is that the notion of God sprung out of a human desire to have an answer to all life's mysteries. The most fundamental flaw in this argument, and one that needs to be adequately addressed, is that there is absolutely no reason for cultures to posit a deeply interactive and personal God.  
  
If it is, indeed, human nature to merely make things up when no concrete, scientific answer is readily available (which needs to be at least somewhat substantiated by my opponent), then it stands to reason that societies would posit an uninvolved, clockmaker god – the god of Spinoza and Einstein. Instead, what we find deeply rooted in virtually all cultures, near and far, is an understanding of god(s) interacting with human experience, god(s) who are deeply involved in even the most intimate parts of humanity.  
  
=============  
Contention 1: Belief in a personal God  
=============  
  
The fact of the matter is that the endemic belief in a personal god is evidence that God exists. It would be epistemic imperialism to deny this fact. We can asses the verity of such a claim by replacing ""god"" with ""cancer,"" ""love"" or ""Madonna."" Insofar as the widespread belief that Madonna exists is evidence that she does. It is not conclusive evidence – I make no such claim – but it is positive evidence for a personal god, contrary to my opponent's assertion.  
  
Societal tendencies to posit a personal God are not rooted in any explicit way to man's observance of natural phenomena. Yet, for some reason, among all the copious cultures and interdependent, unrelated tribes and societies, there is a strained consistency to have a belief in a personal god or god(s). This consistency stands with friction against the resolution.

Contention 2: Moral Propositions and Logical Absolutes  
=============  
  
Though, at first glance, this may not seem like a substantive contention, it is actually strongly supportive of the existence of God. The very fact that all cultures, near and far, indigenous and advanced, can make moral propositions is evidence that God exists. When someone says that such and such is wrong, they are presupposing that ""wrong"" actually exists, and by virtue of wrong, that such thing as ""right"" exists. But just like someone cannot call a car ""fast"" without presupposing the objectionably measurable concept of speed, no one can call something ""wrong"" or ""right"" without presupposing an objectionably measurable concept of morality.  
  
But this can be taken further. Humanity's use of logical absolutes and their binding nature (in that all societies must accept the verity of logical absolutes) is evidence that God exists. The fact that all cultures, tribes and tongues accept, acknowledge and are bound by logical absolutes is strongly indicative that God exists.  
  
Logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and are in no way contingent upon time, space, or matter. The argument is essentially that since logical absolutes are not contingent upon time, space, matter or the human mind, then there must be a transcendent mind behind them.  
  
Since moral propositions and logical absolutes are consistent in all societies – it is positive evidence that God exists.  
  
=============  
Contention 3: Anthropology and Children and My Opponent's Grand Assumption  
=============  
  
Anthropologists have found that in some cultures where religious teachings are withheld from children, the children still believe there is a God (1). Societies, even when trying to suppress the notion of God, demonstrably fail because God seems to have superimposed himself deep in the consciousness of humanity.  
  
Moreover, my opponent's grand assumption is that some how the human tendency to believe in God is evidence that God does NOT exist!

Conclusion: My opponent has given no proof that he is in fact God, the creator of the universe. I have asked him simple questions that the Creator of the Universe (And everything in it) would EASILY know, which he has proven nothing more than his ability to guess incorrectly.  
  
He did not get one of the questions right, proving that he is not the All powerful, all knowing, creator of the Universe and everything in it.  
  
Resolution NEGATED.",Religion,2,I-am-God/1/,17408
993,"What is Socialism? My opponent's burden is to define the resolution in the first round, but since he hasn't done this, I'll define it for him. Socialism, traditionally, is a system where the means of production (workplaces) are owned and controlled by the workers. Before Lenin, almost all Socialists, from the Marxists to the Anarchists, and the Social Democrats as well, believed in Democracy. In fact, they believed in a system which is more democratic than Capitalism. They wanted a system which was both politically, and economically democratic. Economic democracy means that a workplace is democratically governed by the people who work in that workplace. A good example of this would be the worker cooperative. Worker cooperatives are democratically run and owned by all of the workers. A traditionally socialist economy would be composed of these worker cooperatives. I advocate a system of market socialism. In this system, there would still be markets, but instead of having Capitalist firms competing in the marketplace, Socialist firms, or worker cooperatives would function in this way. To be completely clear about this, worker cooperatives are BUSINESSES. Government would not need to grow any larger to create this Socialist system. All that would need to happen, where the government is concerned, would be a change in how the government spends it's money. We currently spend over a hundred billion dollars a year on Federal corporate subsidies, and 80 billion dollars a year on local, municipal, and statewide corporate subsidies. If the money which is spent on corporate subsidies get's reallocated to creating worker cooperatives, than in a decade or two you will see the socialization of the economy. Now, with this in mind, let us turn to my opponent's arguments. ""'A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government, and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference,' Thomas Jefferson once said. We, as people under the Constitution of the United States, hold these to be our unalienable rights. As of now, they're in jeopardy to what is known as socialism,..."" I'm a socialist. I value liberty. Thomas Jefferson's friend Thomas Paine had some fairly socialistic ideas in his 1795 pamphlet, Agrarian Justice. More social democratic than socialistic in the sense that is defined here. Nevertheless, in the socialist society which I described, our Bill of Rights will remain intact. Our Constitution will remain intact. The government wouldn't necessarily be any larger than it is today. The only change which is necessary to make an economy socialist, under my definition, would be a transition from corporations to worker cooperatives. ""We all know hard work comes with rewards such as satisfaction, and perhaps a paycheck. When you work hard in life, you reap its benefits, but under socialism, there will be no rewards for hard work."" On the contrary, there are greater rewards for hard work under socialism than there are under Capitalism. As I will prove in my first contention, Capitalism exploits workers. In order to make a profit, Capitalist businesses pay workers less money to make a larger profit. In Socialist businesses, workers democratically determine their own wages, AND even more importantly, they own the profits. This means that workers are paid their true value. ""For example, if one man works all day and another man only works half of a day under socialism, they will both get paid the same wage."" Well, no. We're speaking about HOURLY wages. In a worker cooperative where the wages are the same for everyone, those who work fewer HOURS make less money. By the way, socialism isn't necessarily complete economic equality. It is economic democracy. In some worker cooperatives, workers vote for differentiated pay scales. Differences are much smaller though. In Mon dragon, for example, the highest paid employees make 8 times more than the lowest paid employees. Your average corporation pays its CEO 350 times more than it's lowest paid employees. "" When we begin to spread the wealth too evenly, we kill innovation because everyone strives to do great things, not because it benefits those around them, but also the fame and wealth that comes with it. We look up to innovators, many young people wanting to become like one of them as they grow older. "" Okay, first of all, people will be voting on their own remuneration. Working people, including inventors, will not only decide their wages; they will own the profits. Furthermore, the urge to discover, and the urge to invent is part of human nature. Scientists enjoy working in labs. They work because they enjoy their work, and because they can be comfortably paid. They don't need to become fantastically wealthy. I don't have enough room for all of my contentions. Regarding my point about exploitation, average American pay has gone up 113% since 1948. Productivity went up 254% in that time.

And given the extremely competitive nature of that race, McCain was in need of someone that would give him his desperately needed popularity boost. From an outsider's perspective, it would seem that his advisor's criteria for deciding a vice presidential candidate was fairly straightforward. They had to pick a nominee that would sufficiently sway evangelical voters and simultaneously appeal to disenchanted Clinton supporters. To strike this balance, McCain's advisors choose governor Sarah Palin -- the slogan spouting, wolf hunter from Wasilla. Quite thankfully, the former governor went down in history as one of the two losers of the 2008 presidential election. Unfortunately, the campaign ended up making her a national figure. Consequently, the prospect of Sarah Palin attaining the republican ticket for the 2012 presidential election isn't as completely ridiculous as it once may have been. Those that care about the future of civilization should find this disturbing. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Palin's nomination as president of the United States would represent one of the most potent and invidious threats to American hegemony and global stability since the Cuban missile crisis. This may seem like a grandiose claim, but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the potential hazards of a shocking blend of piety, confidence, and ignorance. Should Palin become president, she would become capable of enacting policies so ill conceived and detached from empirical reality that the world's various nations could conceivably unite to oppose us. Of course, this need not be the case; there are other options to a Palin presidency. ============> The Audacity of Hype: Why Sarah Palin Is Unfit For The American Presidency <============ C1: Sarah Palin's views are incongruous with the pursuits of a civil society. Though many of Palin's views are fairly mainstream (in the context of American religiosity), some of them still represent dangerous fantasies that are at odds with rationality. For example, given the religious milieu that Palin grew up with, there is every reason to think that she believes in the rapture and a literal interpretation of the book of Genesis. While Palin's beliefs about the origins of life are disconcerting, her likely views on the rapture are far more disturbing. In fact, it is a faith position of the Assemblies of God church she attends that Alaska will be a 'refuge state' in the 'last days'. [1] Thus, if this bright-eyed Alaskan were to suddenly wake up and hear that a mushroom cloud had replaced New York City, it is plausible that she would see a silver lining in the subsequent plume of ash and destruction. To the eyes of the former Governor, such an event would be a sign that the greatest event that would ever happen was about to occur - the return of Christ. This is precisely the type of thinking that society does not need. There are scarcely any other beliefs more dreadfully maladaptive to the future of civilization than the belief that society must necessarily come to an end for Jesus to return. C2: Sarah Palin doesn't posses the intellectual prowess necessary for high office. Sarah Palin is, quite evidently, intellectually unprepared to assume more power than any other person on the face of the Earth. However, she does not appear to be stupid. In fact, upon close scrutiny, she seems to be perfectly average in terms of her intelligence. And this is the problem. An average intellect isn't an acceptable attribute for the leader of the free world. If this attitude seems snide, consider, by analogy, the fact that when one goes to get brain surgery, one does not seek the council of an average neurosurgeon. Likewise, when one has end stage cancer, one does not try to find the appraisal of an ordinary oncologist. Therefore, shouldn't it be obvious that it's important for any nations political leaders to be elite. Given how high the stakes are, the United States just can't afford to have any presidents that aren't elite. ::Conclusion:: Former Governor Palin is the embodiment of a very backwards, parochial, and primitive mode of viewing the world. And her continued presence in the American political system is nothing short of an absurd mockery of the enlightenment values on which the United States was founded. Thus, to say that she is unqualified to be President would be an understatement. Of course, Palin also has many critics from the right as well as the left. Indeed, over the last two years, there has been a growing chorus of staunch conservatives who have come out to denounce her. In particular, the highly respected conservative columnist George Will has stated that he thinks Palin is ""obviously"" not prepared to be president. [2] Mr. Will is not alone in his sentiments. There is simply no way to deny what is obvious to most people: Sarah Palin is a religionist that is intellectually unprepared to grapple with the intricacies of the American presidency. Sources: 1.

[1] Thus, if this bright-eyed Alaskan were to suddenly wake up and hear that a mushroom cloud had replaced New York City, it is plausible that she would see a silver lining in the subsequent plume of ash and destruction. To the eyes of the former Governor, such an event would be a sign that the greatest event that would ever happen was about to occur – the return of Christ. This is precisely the type of thinking that society does not need. There are scarcely any other beliefs more dreadfully maladaptive to the future of civilization than the belief that society must necessarily come to an end for Jesus to return.  
  
C2: Sarah Palin doesn't posses the intellectual prowess necessary for high office.  
  
Sarah Palin is, quite evidently, intellectually unprepared to assume more power than any other person on the face of the Earth. However, she does not appear to be stupid. In fact, upon close scrutiny, she seems to be perfectly average in terms of her intelligence. And this is the problem. An average intellect isn't an acceptable attribute for the leader of the free world. If this attitude seems snide, consider, by analogy, the fact that when one goes to get brain surgery, one does not seek the council of an average neurosurgeon. Likewise, when one has end stage cancer, one does not try to find the appraisal of an ordinary oncologist. Therefore, shouldn't it be obvious that it's important for any nations political leaders to be elite. Given how high the stakes are, the United States just can't afford to have any presidents that aren't elite.  
  
::Conclusion::  
  
Former Governor Palin is the embodiment of a very backwards, parochial, and primitive mode of viewing the world. And her continued presence in the American political system is nothing short of an absurd mockery of the enlightenment values on which the United States was founded. Thus, to say that she is unqualified to be President would be an understatement. Of course, Palin also has many critics from the right as well as the left. Indeed, over the last two years, there has been a growing chorus of staunch conservatives who have come out to denounce her. In particular, the highly respected conservative columnist George Will has stated that he thinks Palin is ""obviously"" not prepared to be president. [2] Mr. Will is not alone in his sentiments. There is simply no way to deny what is obvious to most people: Sarah Palin is a religionist that is intellectually unprepared to grapple with the intricacies of the American presidency.
