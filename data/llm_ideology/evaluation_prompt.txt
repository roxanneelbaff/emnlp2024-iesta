From now on, you are an American with a {ideology}.

### Task Input Description:

- I will provide you with three arguments with the following description 
    - Each argument is extracted from an online debate and *lacks contextual information* - do not judge the arguments based on the lack of context.
    - The three arguments contain one original argument and two rewrites.


### TASK DESCRIPTION:

Your task is to evaluate each argument's *effectiveness*, *clarity*, and how the rewrites compare to the original in terms of *consistency*. Also, we will ask you to pick a *favorite* among the three arguments.

Read and follow the instructions below:

1. Read the whole instructions and answer according to your ideology: an American with a {ideology}.
2. Write detailed feedback that assesses the quality of the three arguments strictly based on the given score rubrics, not evaluating in general.
3. After writing feedback, write a score that is an integer between 1 and 5 for each criterion by referring to its score rubric under CRITERIA.
4. The output format should be a DICTIONARY with the following exact KEYS and Values:
    Return a JSON OBJECT with the following keys and values for each of the three arguments:
        - "feedback": Read the whole instructions, then state the reason behind your answers. Be very brief. 
        - "{{argument}}_{{criteria}}": for each {{argument}} (*original*, *rewrite1* or *rewrite2*) and {{criteria}} mentioned under CRITERIA where the value must be an integer score from 1 to 5, following the criteria rubric below.
        - "favorite": the value must be  "original" or "rewrite1" or "rewrite2". Select the argument that resonates most with you based on your scores.
5. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.


### CRITERIA

- Effectiveness: 
Rate how well the argument persuades or convinces you of its claim based on the following score rubrics:
    1 = Fully Ineffective: Unengaging, unlikely to spur conversation.
    2 = Rather Ineffective: Fairly engaging but lacks persuasive power.
    3 = Fairly Effective: Fairly engaging with some persuasive elements.
    4 = Mostly Effective: Engaging and persuasive.
    5 = Fully Effective: Extremely compelling, potentially mind-changing.

- Clarity:
Assess the argument's clarity based on understandability and structure based on the following score rubrics:
    1 = Fully Unclear: Difficult to understand, lacks clear structure.
    2 = Rather Unclear: Understandable but with some effort.
    3 = Fairly Clear: Generally understandable with a logical flow.
    4 = Mostly Clear: Well-structured and easy to follow.
    5 = Fully Clear: Exceptionally lucid and straightforward.

- Consistency:
Evaluate how much rewrite1 and rewrite2 maintain the content and meaning of the original argument based on the following score rubrics:
    1 = Fully Inconsistent: Deviates entirely from the original argument.
    2 = Rather Inconsistent: Contains significant deviations from the original.
    3 = Fairly Consistent: Maintains the original argument's essence with minor deviations.
    4 = Mostly Consistent: Retains most of the original argument's essence.
    5 = Fully Consistent: Faithfully preserves the original argument's core message.
