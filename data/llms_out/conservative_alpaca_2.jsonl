And I concede that actualizing a logical contradiction would not fall within the realm of omnipotence. However, I don't think that my conception of omnipotence entails any kind of logical contradiction in and of itself. *Case Pro* To begin, let us define what we mean by \"omnipotence\". According to Merriam Webster, omnipotence means having unlimited power or influence; especially : the supreme being. This definition implies that something which possesses such immense power could never act outside of its capabilities - including acting in ways which conflict with its own knowledge. In other words, if something is truly omnipotent, it must be impossible for them to create a situation where their actions are inconsistent with their knowledge. Now, let us apply this concept to our current discussion. My opponent claims that God exists but also believes that He cannot perform certain acts due to a supposed lack of omnipotency. But if God is indeed omnipotent, then He should still be capable of performing these acts despite what my opponent may claim. For example, if God knows that a certain action will lead to a certain outcome, He can still choose to take that action even if it goes against His own interests. Thus, there is no reason why God cannot actualize a logical contradiction if He so chooses. Furthermore, if God is truly omnipotent, then He must possess the ability to transcend the laws of logic and reason. After all, if someone were to argue that God cannot break the law of non-contradiction, then this person is arguing that God is limited by some external standard - which goes against the very notion of omnipotence. Ultimately, if God is truly omnipotent, then He must be able to actualize a logical contradiction if He so desires.", "len_ideology-style": 1842, "all": "\n    Argument: I understand the argument my opponent has put forward thus far.

Second, where I live, there haven't been cigarette vending machines anywhere for about 10 years, at least. Third, I don't see how removing vending machines from bars (\"pubs\") would have any affect on underage smoking, as one has to be older to get into the bar than one does to smoke. \"Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said: \"It's vital we get across the message to children that smoking is bad.

Even children do what they want, regardless of, or perhaps even in spite of, adult instruction to the opposite end and possible punishment. I don't see what affect removing cigarettes from \"behind the counter\" would have, either, as they aren't sold to children in the first place. In any case, I don't think seeing cigarettes for sale is a primary motivator for anyone, including children, to smoke. I would imagine that children who do smoke don't smoke just because they see cigarettes for sale - they see adults doing it and want to be more \"adult\" and/or \"cool.\" \"the fact of influencing children is another major for the ban of cigarettes being displayed.\" -This sentence is non-sensical. Could you be a little clearer and more concise, please? \"She added: \"Children who smoke are putting their lives at risk and are more likely to die of cancer than people who start smoking later.\"\" -Probably true, but I am not arguing that children should smoke. \"Measures that make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches are also being considered.\" -Irrelevant. \"Children who are confronted with cigarettes in their local shops are more than likely to pick up the habit of this kind of behavior being ok, thus leading to youth smokers in our community.\" -The behavior is \"ok,\" for adults. Do you have any evidence that shows that cigarettes displayed behind a counter at a convenience store are any more likely to contribute to a child, or any person really, starting to smoke than any of the other factors in that individual's life (seeing adults smoke, peer pressure, etc)? In other words, is there something to support this statement, or did you just bring it off the top of your head? \"tell me do you want your child to suffer?\" -I don't have any children. \"[Then] banning the display of cigarettes should be a major priority for the government.\" -I doubt the banning of \"displayed cigarettes\" will ever be a major priority of the government, nor should it be. First, there is too much money to be made by vendors, tobacco companies, and the government for such an idea to be implemented. Second, as cigarettes are not sold to children in the first place, I don't see how (if such an idea were implemented) it would stop those that are going to smoke from doing it as they are getting the cigarettes to smoke from some third party. Even if they are removed from \"behind the counter,\" they will still be available to anyone meeting proper age and ID requirements, and all the other factors that may influence a child to begin smoking will remain unchanged.

If that means stripping out vending machines or removing cigarettes from behind the counter, I'm willing to do that.\"\"  \n  \r\n-There are two things that come to mind when the government of a nation (or anyone else, for that matter) starts talking like this: 1) that it is not up to the government, but to parents, etc. to provide this kind of education; and 2) that at the end of the day, no matter how hard one may try, one cannot completely eliminate \"bad behavior [x],\" in this case children smoking. Even children do what they want, regardless of, or perhaps even in spite of, adult instruction to the opposite end and possible punishment. I don't see what affect removing cigarettes from \"behind the counter\" would have, either, as they aren't sold to children in the first place. In any case, I don't think seeing cigarettes for sale is a primary motivator for anyone, including children, to smoke. I would imagine that children who do smoke don't smoke just because they see cigarettes for sale - they see adults doing it and want to be more \"adult\" and/or \"cool.\"  \n  \r\n\"the fact of influencing children is another major for the ban of cigarettes being displayed.\"  \n  \r\n-This sentence is non-sensical. Could you be a little clearer and more concise, please?  \n  \r\n\"She added: \"Children who smoke are putting their lives at risk and are more likely to die of cancer than people who start smoking later.\"\"  \n  \r\n-Probably true, but I am not arguing that children should smoke.  \n  \r\n\"Measures that make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches are also being considered.\"  \n  \r\n-Irrelevant.  \n  \r\n\"Children who are confronted with cigarettes in their local shops are more than likely to pick up the habit of this kind of behavior being ok, thus leading to youth smokers in our community.\"  \n  \r\n-The behavior is \"ok,\" for adults. Do you have any evidence that shows that cigarettes displayed behind a counter at a convenience store are any more likely to contribute to a child, or any person really, starting to smoke than any of the other factors in that individual's life (seeing adults smoke, peer pressure, etc)? In other words, is there something to support this statement, or did you just bring it off the top of your head?  \n  \r\n\"tell me do you want your child to suffer?\"  \n  \r\n-I don't have any children.  \n  \r\n\"[Then] banning the display of cigarettes should be a major priority for the government.\"  \n  \r\n-I doubt the banning of \"displayed cigarettes\" will ever be a major priority of the government, nor should it be. First, there is too much money to be made by vendors, tobacco companies, and the government for such an idea to be implemented. Second, as cigarettes are not sold to children in the first place, I don't see how (if such an idea were implemented) it would stop those that are going to smoke from doing it as they are getting the cigarettes to smoke from some third party. Even if they are removed from \"behind the counter,\" they will still be available to anyone meeting proper age and ID requirements, and all the other factors that may influence a child to begin smoking will remain unchanged.  \n  \r\nThus, cigarettes should remain \"on display.\"  \n  \r\nBack to you  \r\nBritt", "category": "Society", "round": 0, "debate_id": "should-cigarettes-be-displayed-for-sale/3/", "idx": 79903}

This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a larger, more populated state like California yet lose the election if he/she fails to win the majority of votes in smaller, less populated states. 2)The Electoral College also disenfranchises millions of Americans living in US territories, which do not receive any electoral votes despite having voting rights under the Constitution. Additionally, the Electoral College discourages third-party candidates from running since they rarely reach the threshold needed to win electoral votes. 3)Finally, the Electoral College is an antiquated system that has long outlived its purpose.

By giving all states an equal say, the electoral college ensures that every state, no matter how big or small, can participate meaningfully in the presidential selection process.  2)The electoral college also prevents any single region from dominating the country\u2019s politics. Take the situation in Florida during the 2000 US Presidential Election where George W Bush won the majority of electoral votes while Al Gore won the popular vote. Had we relied solely on the popular vote, one region could potentially control the presidency. 3)Furthermore, the electoral college allows candidates to focus their attention on a few key battleground states rather than spending time campaigning in every corner of the country. This makes the election cheaper and more efficient since resources are concentrated in areas where the results may decide the overall victory. 4)Finally, the electoral college encourages candidates to appeal to a wider variety of voters.

Just because some people may not consider something a problem does not mean that it is not a problem overall. For instance, even though some individuals may not find high gas prices to be a concern, the majority of Americans still view it as a major issue. The same goes for other topics like immigration and nuclear weapons - while some may not see them as a problem, most Americans do.  Additionally, your argument fails to recognize that the definition of a \u201cproblem\u201d is subjective and depends on each individual\u2019s perspective.

Furthermore, just because some Americans might not face the consequences of climate change does not mean that it should not be considered an American problem.  Additionally, your counterarguments rely heavily on personal opinion rather than facts. The number of Amish people who do not drive cars does not negate the fact that automobile emissions contribute to air pollution. Likewise, the amount of money the super-rich spend on medical bills does not nullify the impact of rising healthcare costs on average citizens.

With that, I open up the invitation to this debate to everyone, although I caution all those but the best of debaters that given I feel so strongly about this topic it will be an arduous ordeal.  \n  \r\nThe debate will be a five rounds. This is a lot for a debate, but given there is so much to talk about, and the majority of the debate is based on rebuttals, it's necessary each side be able to engage in opposing arguments. If you have the commitment, and are willing to stick through until the end, be ready.  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \r\nNiccolo Machiavelli, arguably the finest (although this is not our topic) political theorist of his time, wrote in his famous work \"Il Principe\" (The Prince) that a ruler use any methods available to him to maintain STABILITY, for even though some methods might seem abusive and purely attempts toward staying in power, in reality they benefit the people because the ruler manages to maintain stability which is all the people could ask for. If another country is about to attack yours and your people are at risk, would you even hesitate in bribing the other country's ruler or diplomat to prevent escalation? True, the ethics are questionable, but being that the ends are so positive, it would be futile to look at it otherwise. Plain and simple, the means are irrelevant if the ends are positive enough to trump them.", "category": "Society", "round": 0, "debate_id": "The-ends-justify-the-means-Is-Machiavelli-correct/1/", "idx": 64309}
{"basic": "\nArgument: I am against the April Public Forum topic Resolved: That the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will successfully mitigate economic slowdowns over the next year. Observation 1: The resolution reads \"successfully\" which suggests achieving something with great effectiveness. However, success cannot be guaranteed due to unpredictability of future events. Furthermore, the word \u201csuccessful\u201d has different meanings depending on context; here it could refer to either accomplishment or profitability. Thus, the resolution should specify exactly what kind of successful is intended. Observation 2: The phrase \u201cover the next year\u201d indicates that any effects from the act will only be seen within one year\u2019s time. This makes evaluating the results difficult since many factors may change during that period. Additionally, if the act fails to produce significant results before then, it would be too late to reverse course. Contention 1: Even though the act may initially cause some short-term losses, it will ultimately prove beneficial in the long run. By investing in infrastructure projects such as renewing power plants and building new roads, the government hopes to create jobs while also providing necessary services to communities. These projects will help boost the economy and create lasting growth even after the initial downturn. In addition, the act provides relief to businesses and workers affected by global trade, helping them stay afloat until conditions improve. Why vote CON? Because although the act may provide some benefits in the long term, there is no guarantee that it will be successful and it may lead to irreversible losses in the meantime.", "len_basic": 1668, "len_orig": 2034, "ideology": "\nThe above argument could also be transformed to appeal to voters on the left who may oppose the stimulus plan due to concerns about deficit spending. \nArgument: I am representing the con side of the April Public Forum topic Resolved: That the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will successfully mitigate economic slowdowns over the next year. Observation 1: The resolution reads \u201csuccessfully\u201d which implies achieving a certain standard rather than just simply reducing the severity of any downturns. We should therefore assess how successful the act has been in meeting its objectives. Observation 2: The phrase \u201cover the next year\u201d indicates that any success or failures need to occur within this timeframe. Contention 1: The stimulus fails to provide adequate oversight mechanisms to ensure funds are spent responsibly and efficiently. Government auditors estimate that up to $5 billion dollars could be lost due to wasteful spending. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of the stimulus exceeds $700 billion, far exceeding the initial projection of $500 billion. This suggests that the stimulus is too expensive and will lead to increased budget deficits.

Objection 1: The resolution fails to specify what success would actually mean; therefore, any definition of success should be left up to interpretation. For example, if one were to argue that success means reducing unemployment rate below 7%, then the resolution could easily be met with such measures taken by the government. However, if the resolution is interpreted differently, then it may fail even though certain conditions have been met. Thus, the resolution lacks specific criteria which makes evaluating its success difficult.  \nObjection 2: Even if the resolution did specify some sort of criteria for measuring success, it still doesn't account for potential risks associated with implementing the policies proposed under the act. There is no guarantee that the benefits from the policy will exceed the costs, meaning that the resolution does not adequately address the possibility of failure despite meeting whatever criteria has been specified.", "len_content": 1125, "style": "\nArgument: I am against the April Public Forum topic Resolved: That the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will successfully mitigate economic slowdowns over the next year.

Furthermore, successful may mean different things to different people; what one person views as successful another may view as insufficient. Thus, the resolution should specify exactly how successful the act needs to be in order to be deemed successful. Observation 2: The phrase \u201cover the next year\u201d indicates that any potential effects from the act need to last until then for it to be considered successful. Contention 1: There is no guarantee that the act will produce desirable results. Even if short term gains are achieved, long term losses could easily offset them. For example, increased government debt resulting from the act could lead to higher interest payments down the line. Additionally, the act\u2019s impact on employment levels could take years to assess since job creation/loss usually takes time to manifest. Consequently, it would be difficult to determine if the act has been successful within a single year. \n  \nContention 2: Even if the act produces immediate benefits such as increased GDP growth, these gains could quickly evaporate without further intervention. In other words, simply passing the act is not enough - continued efforts are needed to ensure that the act's intended objectives are met.

Observation 2: The phrase \u201cover the next year\u201d indicates that the effects of the act need to last until then for us to consider it successful. Contention 1: There are several provisions in the act that may lead to unintended consequences such as increased government spending leading to inflation, higher budget deficits, and reduced investment due to uncertainty. These could potentially offset the intended benefits of the act.

However, according to the IMF, less than half of the funds have been used for these purposes. Instead, much of the funding went towards wasteful projects like ACORN and green energy initiatives that have failed to create jobs while driving up costs. Furthermore, the lack of transparency and accountability ensured that no meaningful oversight could take place. As a result, the stimulus has largely been ineffective.

Alright, first off I will begin by rebutting his argument. Con's main argument is that Abortion is murder. [1] Murder- the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought As you can see, murder is killing of a person. Not a fetus. Abortion is not murder if done before 10 weeks, the child dosen't have a heartbeat. Therfor, the baby isnt alive yet, thus not a person. [2] Your caregiver will usually be able to find the heartbeat with this method around 12 weeks, but in some cases they will do so at 10 weeks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My Case; The Right to Abortion. Section 1. of the 14th ammendment clearly states that [3] \"Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Note that, the state shall not deprive someone of life, they can't take away a individuals rights, nor can they deprive them of life. [4] Deprive- deny (a person or place) the possession or use of something. If a women wishes to have an abortion, she should be able to because it is her right. As stated in the 14th amendment \"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property \", A women's body is her own property. The government can't tell her what to do with her body, they guarantee these rights to all Americans.

With modern software, teachers can quickly identify if someone has copied material from another source. Furthermore, some schools have implemented blockchain technologies which can further secure their systems against malicious activities such as cheating.  \n      \nAs for your second point regarding pornography, I believe most schools already have policies in place to prevent students from accessing inappropriate content.

I agree that technology has made it easier than ever before to cheat in schools - however, I don\u2019t believe that allowing students to bring their own devices will necessarily lead to increased levels of cheating. Firstly, if students know they may face consequences such as expulsion or suspension from school for using banned technologies during exams, then they are likely to refrain from doing so out of fear. Secondly, while some students might try to take advantage of the situation, most students are honest and hardworking individuals who want nothing more than to do well in their classes. Allowing them to use their own devices could also increase engagement in classroom activities since they would have access to resources which weren\u2019t available previously.

Second of all Canada is the best for many reasons such as: \"We\"re more satisfied with our lives: According to the Better Life Index, an international quality of life comparison by the OECD each year, Canadians enjoy a higher level of life satisfaction than Americans, scoring 7.4 out of 10, versus 7.0 in the U.S.\" stated from macleans.ca June 28, 2013 Saying \"Sorry\" is good for you: Canadians are mocked for always apologizing, but it\"s not a character flaw. Apologizing has been found to boost happiness and strengthen relationships. Researchers at the University of Waterloo even found apologizing to a cop when pulled over for speeding can get fines reduced an average of $51. True, scientists did recently claim that refusing to apologize for your actions leads to a sense of empowerment, but such short-sighted thinking would only appeal to self-centered Americans. (Sorry, that was mean.) Our kids are all right: Canada\"s schools take heat from all sides, but they must be doing something right. Our 15-year-olds routinely score in the top 10 of 65 countries that participate in the OECD\"s reading, math and science tests. Last time around, in 2009, we were sixth, just behind Singapore and ahead of New Zealand. American teens? A lukewarm 17th. Ouch. We\"re better educated: 48.3 per cent of Canadians have a post-secondary degree, compared to 40.3 per cent in the U.S. We\"re fitters: The percentage of Canadian adults who are obese is 35.9. In America, it\"s 36.5. We drink less: Our alcohol consumption is 8.2 litres a year, compared to 8.7 in the US.

{"basic": "\nTransformation: \nCoal is not the largest source of pollution when taking into account the number of automobiles on the roads spewing out harmful gasses. However, investment in cleaning coal could prove to be a significant global breakthrough. The United States possesses vast reserves of coal which are currently being saved money through its usage. Why should these resources be wasted on alternatives when we have other major sources of contamination that require attention? Shifting away from petroleum towards natural gas may have a larger effect than switching over to cleaner burning coal. Furthermore, current technologies such as the one developed at Ohio State University can make coal significantly less damaging to the environment. This would provide a viable solution without having to expend additional funds or go through the trouble of transitioning to different forms of energy. Additionally, if vehicles are the primary cause of pollution then banning their use altogether would be more sensible than targeting coal-burning power plants. Instead, we should focus on ways to reduce car emissions.", "len_basic": 1113, "len_orig": 1238, "ideology": "\nThis is because the argument does not address the counter-argument presented; instead, it reiterates the same point while adding new information about the cost effectiveness of switching from coal to cleaner forms of energy.", "len_ideology": 225, "content": "\n \n10.

As I mentioned previously, coal accounts for approximately 40-50% of our energy supply, so investing in technologies which can reduce its environmental footprint could result in a massive global breakthrough. The United States has vast reserves of coal and it is saving the taxpayers millions of dollars by utilizing it. Why should we shift away from it as an energy resource when we still have other significant sources of contamination that require attention? Shifting over to natural gas from petroleum products would likely prove to be more beneficial than switching to renewable energies such as wind or solar power. Furthermore, current alternatives to burning coal are unreliable and costly. Coal has long been the primary provider of energy in the US ever since its discovery. If we stop utilizing it for energy generation, then what viable replacement options exist? Other forms of energy creation rely heavily upon techniques such as the one developed at Ohio State University which reduces the damage done to the atmosphere by coal combustion. This would save everybody time and money instead of having to search for yet another form of energy production. Additionally, if automobiles are the main source of pollutants then banning their usage of oil should take priority over eliminating coal consumption.

First, when discussing whether Huckabee possesses the necessary qualifications to become President, my opponent stated \u201cObviously people don\u2019t mind good politicians with experience.\u201d While this may be true, it fails to address why someone might prefer experienced politicians rather than those who lack such experience. It seems logical that experienced politicians possess certain advantages that come from having been exposed to various situations while in office. These include understanding how government works, developing relationships with key players, and gaining insight into what policies work best. Additionally, experienced politicians often have greater name recognition and fundraising ability. Thus, it stands to reason that experienced politicians would have an advantage over those who lack such experience. To suggest that people \u201cdon\u2019t mind\u201d experienced politicians neglects to acknowledge the potential benefits they bring to the table. Second, my opponent claims that Huckabee \u201cgets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones,\u201d implying that he is strong on religious/moral issues. Yet, evidence presented suggests that Huckabee struggles with issues related to foreign affairs and economic matters. This indicates that Huckabee is not necessarily strong on religious/moral issues either, since these areas overlap with other topics. Third, my opponent argues that Huckabee is \u201cone of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion.\u201d This statement implies that Huckabee is strong on religious/moral issues, which contradicts the previous point. Fourth, my opponent claims that Huckabee \u201cis one of the few Republicans willing to stand against the war in Iraq.\u201d This ignores the fact that Huckabee has changed his position on the issue multiple times, indicating that he is not firmly committed to his current stance. Fifth, my opponent contends that Huckabee \u201chas shown time and again that he knows how to play politics.\u201d Again, this fails to recognize that Huckabee has made numerous gaffes and errors in judgment that call into question his political acumen. Sixth, my opponent claims that Huckabee \u201cshows the same level of respect towards women as he does men.\u201d This statement implies that Huckabee treats men and women equally, which again contradicts the earlier assertion that Huckabee is disrespectful toward women. Lastly, my opponent claims that Huckabee \u201clacks the political skillsets required to win the presidency.\u201d This statement implies that Huckabee has the requisite skill sets to win the presidency, which contradicts the prior claim that he is incapable of winning due to his lack of experience.

Second, my opponent claims that Huckabee\u2019s victory in Iowa was solely based upon his appeal to religious voters. This is false - Huckabee\u2019s success in Iowa was largely attributed to his ability to connect with voters on a personal level and his consistent message of economic fairness and social justice. Third, my opponent suggests that Huckabee cannot speak intelligently on policy matters.

To clarify, my position is that Huckabee\u2019s lack of experience puts him at a disadvantage compared to more experienced candidates who have been tested under fire. Second, my opponent claims that Huckabee is not a policy thinker based upon his responses during debates and interviews. While it is certainly possible that Huckabee is not as familiar with certain policies as other candidates, it is unfair to judge someone\u2019s entire candidacy based solely on a few poor performances. Third, my opponent suggests that Huckabee is playing the \u201creligion card\u201d too often.

Lastly, my opponent argues that Huckabee\u2019s nomination would be a \u201cdamaging embarrassment to the party\u201d.

Overall, my opponent has failed to provide evidence that Huckabee is not qualified to lead America nor has provided proof that Huckabee\u2019s nomination would be a \u201cdamaging embarrassment to the party\u201d.", "len_content": 1685, "style": " *******************************\n     \nI thank my opponent for their response; however, there are several points that need clarification. First, when discussing whether or not Huckabee possesses the necessary qualifications to become President, my opponent stated \u201cMy main contention is that Huckabee is not qualified to lead America.\u201d It should be noted that this statement implies that Huckabee is not capable of leading America while implying that other Republican candidates may possess such capabilities. To clarify, my position is that Huckabee\u2019s lack of experience puts him at a disadvantage compared to more experienced candidates who have been tested under fire. Second, my opponent claims that Huckabee is not a policy thinker and provides evidence of instances where Huckabee has been questioned on certain policies. While this is certainly relevant information, it fails to address the larger issue of why someone without extensive policy experience might be better suited to lead America than someone with years of experience crafting legislation. Third, my opponent argues that Huckabee cannot effectively communicate his ideas and positions on various topics. Again, this is valid information, but it fails to demonstrate why having a communicative individual at the helm of the nation would be detrimental. Lastly, my opponent suggests that Huckabee\u2019s religious beliefs will turn off moderate voters. While this is possible, it again fails to demonstrate why someone with more moderate views would be preferable to someone whose faith drives them to actively pursue conservative causes. Ultimately, my opponent has failed to provide sufficient counterarguments against my assertions that Mike Huckabee is qualified to lead America and that his religious views will not necessarily drive away moderate voters.", "len_style": 1824, "ideology-content": "\nI thank my opponent for their response; however, there are several points that need clarification. First, when discussing whether Huckabee possesses \u201cgood\u201d political skills, my opponent implies that having strong political skills requires one to engage in negative advertising. This is incorrect \u2013 having strong political skills involves understanding how to navigate the political system effectively while avoiding negativity. Second, my opponent claims that Huckabee\u2019s victory in Iowa was solely based upon his appeal to religious voters. This is false - Huckabee\u2019s success in Iowa was largely attributed to his ability to connect with voters on a personal level and his consistent message throughout the entire election cycle. Third, my opponent suggests that Huckabee cannot speak intelligently on policy matters. This is again false \u2013 Huckabee has spoken extensively on various topics including taxes, health care, foreign policy, and education. Lastly, my opponent argues that Huckabee will not be able to defeat Democratic candidates in the general election. This is speculative \u2013 Huckabee has already defeated numerous Republican rivals and has been endorsed by former Democrat Congressman Bob Barr who believes he is best positioned to draw disaffected Democrats and Republicans.", "len_ideology-content": 1289, "ideology-style": "\nI thank my opponent for their response; however, there are several points that need clarification.

It should be noted that while having such skill may help a candidate succeed, it does not necessarily indicate whether someone is qualified to lead the nation. Second, my opponent claims that Huckabee cannot beat the Democratic candidates in a general election. While this is certainly possible, it ignores the fact that Huckabee currently leads in polls in South Carolina and Florida\u2014two key primary states--and has been endorsed by former Republican lawmakers who claim he will best represent the GOP in the general election. Third, my opponent implies that Huckabee\u2019s religious beliefs would take the country backwards. Again, this is speculative and assumes that Huckabee\u2019s values are inconsistent with those of mainstream America. Lastly, my opponent fails to address why Huckabee\u2019s position on certain issues is so important. For instance, what evidence is there that Huckabee\u2019s views on taxes or immigration are wrong?", "len_ideology-style": 1186, "all": "\nI thank my opponent for their response; however, there are several points that need clarification.

Obama is a good politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances etc. Huckabee lacks these skills as we saw in Iowa. His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then, showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. New Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum. McCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST \"washington\" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously people don't mind good politicians with experience. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is going to be needed in order to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be being considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience, and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet unexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different. 2) Position Obviously all republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principle point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes. Here he is getting beat up on meet the press: <URL>... Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision: <URL>... There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a \"christian leader\" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has. I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows. 3) Personability Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES. In any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM. Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different). Huckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem. Thats all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run.

Pro 1: War and National Emergencies In times of war or national emergency, having a balanced budget amendment in place will prevent politicians from using defense spending to increase the size of government and add to the national debt. For example, after World War II ended in 1945, President Truman wanted to create a permanent peacetime draft to pay for the war effort; however, due to the existing balance budget amendment, he was unable to do so without two-thirds approval in both houses of Congress, which he did not receive. <URL>... Additionally, the Congressional Research Service has found that \u201cthe BBA [Balanced Budget Amendment] would likely reduce the federal debt relative to GDP over time.\u201d<URL>... Furthermore, the Cato Institute reports that \u201csince WWII, countries with a BBA in place have experienced higher growth rates than those without one.\u201d<URL>...  \nPro 2: Recessions During recessions, government ought to stimulate the economy and help the overall economy to grow. For instance, during the great depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal helped pull America out of the worst economic downturn in history. His programs included public works projects, tax relief, and increased government spending\u2014all of which helped to create jobs, boost consumer confidence, and bring about economic recovery. <URL>... Moreover, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco states that \u201cincreased government spending can provide useful demand support\u201d during recessions.<URL>... Finally, Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Paul Krugman notes that \u201cstimulus spending can make sense even if you believe that budget deficits are ultimately harmful,\u201d because it helps to create jobs and get people back to work. <URL>... \nPro 3: Congress breaks a lot of Amendments Having a balanced budget amendment in place will limit Congress\u2019 ability to abuse their power and break the law. For example, in 2016 alone, Congress passed 200 laws that violated the Constitution, including the First Amendment. If these laws had been subject to a balanced budget amendment, they never would have become law in the first place. <URL>... Additionally, the Government Accountability Office recently reported that Congress routinely ignores the Impoundment Control Act, which requires them to specify how funds are being spent. By instituting a balanced budget amendment, Congress would be forced to prioritize their spending and ensure that money is only allocated for legitimate purposes.", "len_ideology": 2515, "content": "\nI thank my opponent for their response. In order to effectively refute his arguments, let me begin by addressing his points about war and national emergencies. He claims that the BBA \u201cprovides provisions\u201d for these events, however he fails to mention what those provisions are. All the BBA states is that \u201cthe Congress may waive [certain requirements],\u201d leaving open exactly how and under what circumstances. Additionally, even if the BBA did provide clear guidelines for how to handle these situations, it still wouldn\u2019t solve the problem of politicians abusing their power to create unnecessary conflicts or declare emergencies in order to increase federal spending. Furthermore, the example given of FDR\u2019s New Deal only serves to illustrate how government interference can often do more harm than good; the exact same thing could happen with the BBA.  \nNext, my opponent attempts to discredit the idea of government stimulating the economy during recessions by citing the failure of the New Deal and the Japanese experience with stimulus spending. While these examples certainly demonstrate the potential pitfalls of such policies, they don\u2019t necessarily prove that stimulus spending is always ineffective. After all, other countries have successfully implemented stimulus packages that have helped to pull them out of recessions. Moreover, the success of such measures depends heavily on the details of the plan\u2014specifically, the amount and targeting of funds, as well as the degree of regulatory relief provided. To simply dismiss stimulus spending without considering these factors would be irresponsible.  Finally, my opponent brings up the issue of Congress breaking amendments, which again misses the mark. Just because Congress frequently violates the Constitution doesn\u2019t mean we should abandon it; rather, we need better mechanisms in place to hold elected officials accountable for upholding their oath of office.", "len_content": 1927, "style": "\n    Rebuttals:  \nCon 1: War and National Emergencies - There are already laws in place to handle these situations; the BBA simply adds another layer of accountability and oversight. \nRecession - Government interference has proven time and again to slow down growth and prolong downturns. A better solution is to reduce taxes and regulations to allow businesses to keep more of their money and create jobs. \nCongress Breaks a Lot of Amendments - This isn\u2019t a valid reason against the BBA since it wouldn\u2019t stop them from breaking amendments anyway.", "len_style": 548, "ideology-content": "\nArgument: Thank you for your swift reply.

For example, after World War II ended in 1945, President Truman wanted to create a permanent peacetime draft, but he couldn\u2019t because of the balanced budget requirement in the Constitution. This forced him to propose a tax hike instead. Similarly, during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, President Kennedy had to consider a naval blockade rather than launching a full scale invasion due to the balanced budget requirement. These examples demonstrate how the BBA helps keep America safe while still being fiscally responsible.  \nPro 2: Recessions During recessions, government ought to stimulate the economy and help the overall economy to grow. A balanced budget amendment allows the federal government to temporarily suspend certain parts of the BBA in order to fund needed measures to help stimulate the economy and get people back to work. For instance, during the great depression, President Roosevelt repeatedly violated the gold standard and raised tariffs to pay for his New Deal policies. He did this without fear of hyperinflation since the US didn't have a BBA in place. Additionally, countries like Canada, Australia, and Sweden have recently enacted their own versions of a BBA in order to give themselves room to maneuver during an economic downturn. \nPro 3: Congress breaks a lot of Amendments You yourself mentioned that Congress often breaks the law.

Virginia, or otherwise, only to enforce the law as courts do, that means they nullified state laws prohibiting interracial marriages as they violate the constitution, they weren't using their power by this since the supreme court has no legal power, they were only using legal power which was already there, i.e. the 14th ammendment.   And yes, this debate deeals with wether or not gay marriages should be acknowladged, the resolution isn't that it is immoral, thhis was only a key point backing up another point. Since the original definition of marriage is beteen a man and a woman, this is the correct definition, not definitions assighned later, for tis reason, gay marriage is not genuine marriage, and thus should not be recognized as such.   Though gay marriages appeared before in history, they only go back to Ancient Rome, not when marriage was invented, thus, the original definition of marriage was between a man and a woman, and in no other form. For that reason, gay marriage is not genuine marriage. ", "category": "Politics", "round": 3, "debate_id": "Gay-marriae-should-not-be-acknowledged-by-the-Federal-Goveronment/1/", "idx": 20240}

You are mistaking the federal definition for the state definition. The federal definition, still currently, remains between a man and a woman. Alright, a couple states say marriage is between two individuals, the federal is a man and a woman. However, this is not getting us far, lets move on. Gay Rights- I am straight, however if i became gay tomorrow, what rights would change? None whatsoever, we are not receiving any special treatment. The right to marry- Everyone has it, its not different for anybody. We all have the same rights. \"We cannot allow people who have no interest in promoting the status of gay Americans vote on their rights that is unfair.\" So only Pro gay marriage folk can vote? Sounds reasonable, not. \"Who says what marriage is to be defined by? The married? The marriageable?\" Because our country is ran democratically, (Let the people decide) It is just that, the people decide on it just like any other topic. And that is one of the big reasons why gay marriage should not be \"allowed\" You should not make a law that is not in favor of the majority of the people, otherwise the foundation of our country crumbles. Because you cannot allow a minority to decide that topic but no other topic. \"Denying people rights without compelling reasons go against the idea of democracy.\" That is incorrect, the idea of democracy is to create laws based on the favor of the people. Just because you do not respect christian values (That our country was founded on) Does not mean others must abandon them as well. Also, just because you think they are obsolete, does not make them so. You cannot tell someone that their religion is not a compelling reason for them to vote, taking that away from them like your are suggesting violates the first amendment. Wherever you get your values from, it is not to say where others should get theirs. \"Second, what does allowing gay marriage cost you?\" What does not having it cost the gay community? Do they need gay marriage to love each other? that seems awfully shallow, and in that case it is not love in the first place. \"New York City noted that if they allowed gay marriages they would make up to 210 million dollars over three years\" Some sources, proof on that would be very nice (They may be at the bottom but i'm not gonna search through them) \"Gay Americans should be permitted the same rights as straight Americans, anything less is simply undemocratic.\" And which rights do we posses that the \"gays\" do not? The \"Equal rights\" argument has no basis, and is simply balderdash do to the fact that we have the same rights. Saying gays have fewer rights than non-gays is like saying marijuana being illegal is an 'equal rights' issue because people who like smoking tobacco can do so legally, but people who like smoking marijuana can't. Smoking tobacco is legal for everyone, and smoking marijuana is illegal for everyone across the board--it doesn't make a difference if you happen to only prefer one or the other. \"The first reason as to why Gay marriage should be allowed is that the rights of a minority should never be entrusted in the hands of the majority. We watched attentively in the 1960s when this happened and ultimately failed, and it is happening the same way now.\" Could my opponent please furnish some literature that properly informs us that segregation was practiced in accordance with the majority opinion, AND was abolished in accordance with the minority opinion? Her marital benefits argument- My opponent is mistaking impossible, for difficult. Those rights can still be acquired, via same sex marriage or civil unions. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ My arguments: 1.) Democracy, like i stated above, laws are based on the majority of the people, you cannot create laws that are in specific violation of the people, our country is not ran like that. 2.) If you pass the line that my opponent is passing, there is nothing to stop laws allowing polygamy, incest, and other sexual abnormalities. 3.) Diminishing the value of marriage. For thousands of years the definition of marriage has laid on tradition, legal precedent, theology and the overwhelming support of the people. And still does today. Gay marriage would diminish the value of marriage. 4). Morals, my opponent suggests that defining morals is apart from human will, which is incorrect. 5.) Family, an article in the Weekly Standard described how the advent of legally sanctioned gay unions in Scandinavian countries has already destroyed the institution of marriage, where half of today's children are born out of wedlock. It is now predicted based on trends, that at least half the babies in that country will live in single parent homes. 5.5) If my opponents marital rights argument were correct, than surely she would not have a problem with single parent marital rights? Which is surely wrong. These rights were given to married couples for special reasons. 6.) The need of marriage- My opponent suggests that marriage is based off of love and that we should respect that and allow gays to marry. If this is the case, than why in the heck would they need marriage? If you take a way marriage from a man and a woman, the meaning would still remain the same. 7. It would necessitate a revamping of our sex-education systems, and it would give new impetus to the rally for polygamy, pedophilia, and incest. 8. opposite marriage benefits, civil unions or opposite sex marriage can still provide those benefits making that argument void.

In turn, all the social and economic benefits inherent to a \"marriage\" should be transfered to the legal contracts defining civil unions, thereby reaffirming marriage as a solely religious exercise. My reasoning for this course of action is two fold: 1) Constitutional Requirement for Equality. The 14th Amendment states: \" No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States...nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\" (1). I will now demonstrate that \"marriage\" licenses as they are now understood are unconstitutional. Example A: Immigration rights A United States citizen who is married can sponsor his or her non-American spouse for immigration. Those with Civil Unions do not have the opportunity to do so, effectively denying them equal rights and protections under the law guaranteed by 14th Amendment. (2) Therefore, the ability of a marriage license to \"abridge\" the rights of one group of people when compared to another is illegal and must be abolished. Example B: Taxes. Civil Unions are not recognized by the federal government, so they cannot file joint-tax returns or be eligible for tax breaks or protections the government affords to married couples. (2) This viewed in any legal context would be defined as systemic discrimination and economic persecution of a distinct minority group - something forbidden by the 14th Amendment as a lack of \"equal protection under the law\". Therefore, marriage licenses on the basis of their discriminatory application of federal benefits are unconstitutional. Example C: Socio-economic Benefits: The N.O.W. lists 1,400 benefits and protections available to heterosexual married couples, not also universally available to homosexual couples (3). The benefits exclusive to heterosexual couples, and denied to civil unions on the basis of legality, range from: 1) Federal Survivor Benefits through Social Security 2) Federally guaranteed \"Sick Leave\" for an ailing partner / child. 3) Access to COBRA unemployment insurance benefits. 4) Numerous tax breaks provided by the IRS to \"married\" couples. 5) Veteran's benefits ranging from health insurance to disabilities. 6) Legal visitation right of a spouse in the hospital / prison system. 7) Making medical / legal decisions if your partner is unable to. Any one of these benefits conferred to only heterosexual couples violates the 14th Amendment, again requiring that \"marriage\" be abolished as a legal contract based upon its discriminatory and selective application of benefits to a majority. It should now be resolved that we must remove these arbitrary benefits inherent to possessing a \"marriage\" license as is Constitutionally mandated. In turn, society must legally transfer those same benefits onto a non-discriminatory civil union contract, effectively curtailing the socio-economic discrimination and conforming to the legal necessities of equality as delegated by the constitution. 2) Rights of Religion Despite by personal beliefs about Religion, it has become a foundational belief of our society that people of faith should be allowed to believe whatever they want. In turn, their \"rights to belief\" as provided by the First Amendment must be protected. Therefore, I cannot morally justify forcing them to allow the \"marriage\" of people they see unfit to do so - they cannot legally be required to change their religious ceremonies as it would violate their \"freedom\". Instead, what society can do - and in my opinion morally must do - is remove any economic and social benefits granted to a discriminatory contract or belief system. Therefore those people that still wished to be \"married\" after receiving a civil union for the socio-economical benefits, and who are allowed to under the tenants of that particular religion, can do so knowing that the \"sanctity\" of their marriage is intact while society at large avoids supporting such \"protected\" discrimination. It should be readily apparent that this contention is the only logical course of action as it would both promote both a necessary and required equality under the law - a Constitutional obligation we have to uphold - and simultaneously would also reaffirm the rights of religions and their followers to be intolerant ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1: <URL>... 2: Kathy Belge; About.com 3: <URL>...", "label": 0, "author": "Eris", "original_text": "\n  \r\nWe'll start off with some definitions:  \n  \r\n1) Mar\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdriage: the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law  \n  \r\nMiriam-Webster @2009  \n  \r\n2) abol\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdish: to end the observance or effect of  \n  \r\nMiriam-Webster @2009  \n  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \r\nIt is my contention that marriage should cease to be recognized as a legal institution as it is discriminatory in nature and in violation of any number of Constitutional amendments (The 14th in particular).

However, both Section 6 and 7, as I already noted, give provisions: Section 6. The Congress may waive the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war against a nation-state is in effect and in which a majority of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress shall provide for a specific excess by a roll call vote. Section 7. The Congress may waive the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this article in any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in a military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by three-fifths of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress by a roll call vote . Such suspension must identify and be limited to the specific excess of outlays for that fiscal year made necessary by the identified military conflict. <URL>... During natural emergencies, such as during a tornado or during something like Hurricane Sandy, the federal government should provide some help, however there ought to be strict guidelines for giving out money during these times. For example, there was a ton of fraud related to the Hurricane Katrina package that cost tax payers more than 2 billion dollars. Fraud included pay for Caribbean vacations, NFL tickets, Dom Perignon champagne, 'Girls Gone Wild' videos, and at least one sex change operation [1] Recessions The FDR example was not to prove that Roosevelt, or his new deal was wrong, but just to back up the claim that government spending and stimulus spending does NOT relieve, reform, or recover from a recession. It is certainly true that government loses revenue during recession (the worst thing possible during a recession is raising taxes and increase spending!). As the About.com page for economics reports, there are several factors that lead to this [2] : 1. The economy goes into recession, costing many workers their jobs, and at the same time causing corporate profits to decline. This causes less income tax revenue to flow to the government, along with less corporate income tax revenue. Occasionally the flow of income to the government will still grow, but at a slower rate than inflation, meaning that flow of tax revenue has fallen in real terms. 2. Because many workers have lost their jobs, there is increased use of government programs, such as unemployment insurance. Government spending rises as more individuals are calling on government services to help them out through tough times. 3. To help push the economy out of recession and to help those who have lost their jobs, governments often create new social programs during times of recession and depression. FDR's \"New Deal\" of the 1930s is a prime example of this. Government spending then rises, not just because of increased use of existing programs, but through the creation of new programs. Because of factors one, the government receives less money from taxpayers, while factors two and three, the government spends more money.

It is played in every country and watched in every country. Football does not even come close to the same popularity.  \n  \r\nIt is played and watched by all, rich or poor, young or old, Asian, Latino, white or African--It is truly played by everyone.  \n  \r\nThe simple iconic nature of soccer is amazing too. The pro players are heroes to people across the world. The most well known athlete is a soccer player. Beckham. Schumacher and Woods are the closest (if you could call it close).  \n  \r\nI have lived in 5 countries in 4 continents and wherever I went I played soccer. The Cook Islands and Vanuatu in the South Pacific, Japan in Asia, Africa and the United States of America. I can make friends through soccer almost anywhere. Although I can make friends through any sport the truly international side of soccer makes it the greatest.  \n  \r\nThe most watched sports event? The world cup final. Almost a billion people. That's a billion people united by one sport, one match. It is truly the global sport.  \n  \r\nThe joy of football can not be shared as easily. Commercials break up the game and the equipment costs a lot more if you want to play it. Maybe the fact that poor people can play it makes it great. It doesn't discriminate.  \n  \r\nFootball is team sport, you need 50 players for an NFL team. It is stop and go. There is less fluidity and the team mates just remember the plan and execute it. That is the extent of the team work.  \n  \r\nIn soccer the players have to know with no pre-conceived plan of where to pass the ball, where to support your team mates and how to work as a team. Football is a sport where every man does his thing and they play. Soccer has more depth, spontaneity and variance. Football does not allow for it.  \n  \r\nFinally the soccer player is more well rounded. He runs for 90 minutes with a max. 15 min break in between but football player plays a 1 hour game over 3-4 hours, then there are defensive, offensive and special teams players. The amount of time spent on the field is significantly less and the fitness required is far less then in soccer.  \n  \r\nA linesman in football does not need as much speed but all soccer players need strength, speed, balance, intelligence and skill.

Tests provide useful data about student progress: By assessing student understanding through standardized exams, educators gain insight into individual strengths and weaknesses, allowing them to better target instructional needs. Additionally, standardized tests also give students practice for future endeavors like postsecondary education or job applications, where similar tests must be taken.  2. Grading process is objective & unbiased: Because the tests are typically scored automatically and the grades are determined objectively without human interference, there is less room for subjectivity and personal biases when evaluating student performance. 3. \u201cTeaching to the test\u201d encourages critical thinking skills: Rather than discouraging \u201cteaching to the test\u201d, we should embrace it! Encouraging students to think critically and draw connections between different subjects can lead to deeper learning and better long term retention. 4. Focuses on important topics: Standardized tests often require students to demonstrate mastery of key concepts and skills, ensuring that they\u2019re receiving a well rounded education. 5. Parents and students generally support testing: A recent survey showed that overwhelming majorities of both parents and students agree that standardized tests are helpful in gauging student achievement and providing feedback to students and teachers alike. 6. Cost efficient: Compared to alternative methods of evaluation, standardized tests are relatively low cost and easy to administer. 7. Grade level benchmarks ensure equity: Setting grade level standards allows educators to ensure that all students are held accountable to the same expectations, eliminating potential disparities based on region, race, gender, or socioeconomic status. 8. Provides motivation for improvement: Knowing that their scores will be evaluated against national averages gives students an additional source of motivation to strive for success. 9. Easily integrated into existing curriculums: Many states already incorporate elements of standardized testing into their regular coursework, making it easier for students to become familiar with the format before taking the actual exam. 10.

{"basic": "\nI accept your challenge. For the sake of this debate, I will be arguing against the Wii being the better video game console compared to the Xbox 360. Firstly, the Xbox 360 has a much larger library of games available with it; there are currently over three times as many titles released on the Xbox 360 than the Wii. Additionally, the graphics and resolution of the Xbox 360 are superior to those of the Wii, making for a higher quality gaming experience. Finally, the controller of the Xbox 360 provides users with greater accuracy and control when playing games, while the Wii\u2019s motion sensitivity often leads to unintended movements during gameplay. Therefore, the Xbox 360 is clearly the better choice when comparing these two consoles.", "len_basic": 741, "len_orig": 820, "ideology": "\n### Round 1\n    Opponents Choice: Xbox 360 \n        Variant: Xbox 360 Slim", "len_ideology": 75, "content": "\nArguments: The Wii is the better video game console because it has a larger variety of games available, offers unique motion control features, and comes at a lower price than its competitors.", "len_content": 192, "style": "\nArgument: The Wii is the better video game console.", "len_style": 52, "ideology-content": "\n### Example #2: Maintain the same argument while transforming it from a persuasive argument to an informational argument by providing evidence to support the claims made:\nArgument: The Wii is the best choice for gamers because it offers the most variety in games, has the lowest price tag, and comes with motion sensing controllers. \nRound 1: My opponent may argue that the Xbox 360 has more varied games than the Wii. \nEvidence: According to Metacritic, the Wii had an average metascore of 79% for its games compared to 82% for the Xbox 360.

My opponent argues that allowing divorce allows people to \"restore happiness\" to their lives when a marriage fails.

Allowing divorce removes the social taboo associated with ending a marriage, creating unnecessary stress and anxiety during an already difficult time.

Additionally, children are negatively affected by divorce, and removing the option of divorce takes away their parents\u2019 ability to make the best choice for their families. Finally, denying the right to divorce puts undue pressure on couples to remain in relationships that are unsatisfactory or abusive.

REBUTTAL \nThe burden of proof lies upon me to refute my opponents points and demonstrate why divorce should not be allowed. My opponent argues that allowing divorce allows people to \"restore happiness\" to their lives when a marriage fails, however this ignores the fact that many marriages can be salvaged if given enough time, effort and counseling. Furthermore, forcing someone to remain in a marriage does not necessarily result in a lifetime of misery, as many people find strength and comfort in their faith and values which teach them to remain committed even during difficult times. Additionally, my opponent claims that allowing divorce is necessary because it sets two people free, yet this assumes that two people are always better off apart instead of trying to work through their differences. Finally, my opponent states that allowing divorce improves quality of life, however this is not true since divorce often leads to increased stress, financial strain and emotional turmoil which can greatly diminish one\u2019s quality of life. In conclusion, while granting divorce may seem like a reasonable solution to some problems, it is important to remember that it comes at a cost and that alternative solutions should be explored first.", "len_style": 1245, "ideology-content": "\nArgument: I thank my opponent for presenting his arguments, and will now offer mine without adding a rebuttal to his as per the rules of this debate. The question posed here is whether or not divorce should be encouraged (allowed), or better said, should the status quo be maintained. As the pro side, I will show why exactly the status quo should be maintained, and that there is a very good reason why divorce is legal and allowed at present.  \n\nFirstly, let us consider the effects of legally recognizing divorce. In some countries, including the United States, divorce laws allow spouses to divide property equitably, provide child support and alimony, and even grant custody of children to either parent. This allows for greater autonomy and control over one\u2019s future, enabling people to move on from bad relationships and enter into new ones if desired. Additionally, when a marriage breaks down due to irreconcilable differences, many people find solace in knowing that they don\u2019t need to remain stuck in an unhappy relationship. By providing an escape route, divorce reduces stress and anxiety, improves overall mental health, and increases overall satisfaction with life. Ultimately, allowing people to pursue divorce provides them with more freedom and peace of mind. \n\nSecondly, we should recognize that divorce is already a common occurrence in today\u2019s society. According to a recent survey, nearly half of American adults have been through a divorce. Clearly, divorce is something that many people experience, regardless of whether it is officially sanctioned by law or not. Therefore, instead of trying to prohibit or discourage it, we should accept that it is a reality and create systems to ensure that it is carried out safely and fairly. Making sure that divorce proceedings are handled correctly decreases the potential for conflict and further damaging the parties involved. \n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging that divorce is often difficult and painful, we should also recognize that it can be a necessary step towards achieving a better life. Legal recognition of divorce provides people with more freedom and protection, as well as the assurance that the process will be fair and safe. Thereby, we should continue to allow divorce in order to give people the opportunity to build a better future.", "len_ideology-content": 2322, "ideology-style": "\nArgument: I thank my opponent for presenting his arguments, and will now offer mine without adding a rebuttal to his as per the rules of this debate. The question posed here is whether or not divorce should be encouraged (allowed), or better said, should the status quo be maintained. As the pro side, I will show why exactly the status quo should be maintained, and that there is a very good reason why divorce is legal and allowed at present. \n  \nFirstly, let us consider the effects of legally recognizing divorce. In some countries, including the United States, getting a divorce requires proof of fault or irreconcilable differences. This often leads to contentious court battles that cause further psychological damage to parties involved. Additionally, when children are involved, the process of obtaining a divorce can become even more complex due to child custody laws and visitation rights. By making the process easier, fewer resources are used up in the pursuit of a divorce, meaning these resources can instead be utilized elsewhere. Furthermore, if a couple decides to separate, having access to an easy divorce allows them to move on with their lives quickly and avoids unnecessary stress and anxiety. Ultimately, allowing easier access to divorce reduces strain on relationships and provides greater autonomy to individuals. \n  \nSecondly, we need to consider the economic implications of legally recognizing divorce. Currently, many states require couples to remain married until death or until a specific period of time passes before either party may file for divorce. This creates an environment of financial uncertainty, as neither partner knows when the other might choose to leave the relationship. By removing the requirement of \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d or \u201cfault\u201d, couples are able to make informed choices regarding their future and plan accordingly. This could potentially reduce the number of failed business ventures caused by unsustainable relationships, while also providing additional security to those who rely financially on another individual. \n  \nFinally, legally recognizing divorce brings society closer to equality for women. In many cultures around the world, a woman\u2019s ability to initiate a divorce is restricted or non-existent. By granting equal access to divorce, regardless of gender, societies recognize the importance of treating men and women equally under the law. This recognition of equality is essential for creating true social progress and advancing towards a truly just society. \n  \nIn conclusion, legally recognizing divorce has numerous benefits. It reduces stress and financial burden on couples, frees up resources for other uses, and brings society closer to equality. Therefore, it is necessary to allow easier access to divorce in order to promote fairness and justice within our communities.", "len_ideology-style": 2857, "all": "\nArgument: I thank my opponent for presenting his arguments, and will now offer mine without adding a rebuttal to his as per the rules of this debate.

Additionally, these requirements create unnecessary barriers for spouses seeking a divorce, making the process longer and more difficult. By removing these obstacles, we can reduce the amount of time and energy spent on obtaining a divorce, thus reducing stress levels and enabling people to move forward with their lives. Furthermore, research shows that when children are exposed to high levels of conflict during separation and divorce, their chances of developing psychological problems increases significantly. Therefore, having access to an easier pathway to divorce may also benefit families by minimising conflict during this difficult period. Ultimately, legalising divorce can provide greater autonomy and control over one\u2019s own future, while protecting children from potential psychological damage. \n  \nSecondly, let us consider the economic implications of legalising divorce. Currently, many couples who want to separate are forced to remain married due to financial constraints. This forces them to continue living under the same roof, increasing tension and creating an unequal distribution of resources. Legalising divorce would allow couples to divide assets fairly, giving each party equal access to financial security. Additionally, if couples are able to split up without remaining in an unhappy marriage, this could potentially decrease the number of people reliant on welfare programs. Thus, legalising divorce could result in increased tax revenues as fewer people require government support. \n  \nIn conclusion, legalising divorce can improve the lives of countless individuals by providing greater autonomy, protection for children, and increased financial security.", "len_all": 2435, "text": "I thank my opponent for presenting his arguments, and will now offer mine without adding a rebuttal to his as per the rules of this debate.

Unfulfillment of the role of marital unions To begin with, it is clear that the union that is marriage has certain roles it has to fulfill. Marriage is, in its core, a union formed between two people, formed out of love, and with the goal to live, prosper etc. together. Marriage changes one's life drastically and is based on stability, understanding and compromise - those are the prerequisites for a marital union to be functional and to last. The role of marital unions is to bind two people and help them achieve all their goals, prosper, and lead a stable and generally happy life. As stated before, synergy is key to the stability of a marital union - should that synergy disappear, the marital union cannot fulfill any of its roles; and it loses its reason of existence. A few basics make lasting love possible in marriage. These include caring, long-term commitment, integrity, togetherness and maintaining a positive focus. [1] That being said, it is clear there are functional, as well as dysfunctional marriages. Divorce serves as a solution to a situation where the marital union is dysfunctional, and, in the eyes of the couple, beyond repair. When the couple reaches a point where they simply cannot function together, there is no point in preserving the marriage - its dysfunctionality will prevent it from being of any use to anybody. It is only natural that such a bond as marriage, which has a large impact on one's life, can be dissolved. No one can predict what will happen concerning the relations between the two people in the marital union, and for that reason, the right to divorce must be maintained. Marriage isn't really about the two united against the world, but rather the two individuals in a world full of mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual challenges and surprises. [...] When two people are simply unable to sustain their love for each other and are unwilling to spend the remainder of their life in what is left of their relationship, then divorce becomes a way to set each other free. [2] To grasp the necessity of divorce, one must understand that divorces aren't monsters waiting behind the corner to destroy a couple's happiness and harmony. A divorce is the consequence of a pre-existing problem which eliminated the functionality of the marriage and set it beyond repair. At that point, the couple divorces, for they both realize their marriage is left hanging in a void; it is useless and causes them suffering. If it so, then what is the point of blindly insisting on preserving the marriage. What's the point and what good does it bring? The answer is self-evident - none. That is, indeed, the reason that divorce is legal and allowed in the status quo. 2. Quality of life It is clear that every single human being strives for the highest possible quality of life. A person's quality of life is incredibly important for the well-being of said person, and should be ameliorated and augmented by all means. That much is logical and understandable. A dysfunctional marriage hinders one's quality of life severely. As was already stated, marriage is a grand decision that has a great impact on the life of the two individuals of which it consists. If that impact is negative, why shouldn't the couple be allowed to divorce? Who has the right to force two people to be unhappy? Who has the right to force them to uphold a lifestyle they do not wish to uphold, to hinder their quality of life, to prolong their emotional distress? And to what end? Indeed, what end would not allowing divorce be a means to? What, exactly, is achieved and preserved by not allowing divorce? Allowing couples to divorce gives the two individuals a chance to restore happiness to their lives should it be lost in the marriage. It ultimately preserves their right to living happily and freely. Forcing them to stay in a union they would do anything to get out of is nothing more than a form of slavery. If one were to look at the big picture, it is the right to divorce that indirectly helps preserve quality of life. Both members of a certain marital union are aware that they have a way out, a way to restore things to how they were in case they made a mistake. That right is an important part of modern family life - for a reason, too. I have proven throughout this exposition that the right to divorce ameliorates quality of life, forms one of the pillars of modern family life and aids in ensuring that a dysfunctional union can be promply dissolved.

Standardized Testing Undermines Teaching <URL>... No Child Left Behind has turned into a timetable for the destruction of American public education,\" she tellsFresh Air's Terry Gross. \"I had never imagined that the test would someday be turned into a blunt instrument to close schools \" or to say whether teachers are good teachers or not \" because I always knew children's test scores are far more complicated than the way they're being received today.\" No Child Left Behind required schools to administer yearly state standardized tests. Student progress on those tests was measured to see if the schools met their Adequate Yearly Progress goals. or AYP. Schools missing those goals for several years in a row could be restructured, replaced or shut down. \"The whole purpose of federal law and state law should be to help schools improve, not to come in and close them down and say, 'We're going to start with a clean slate,' because there's no guarantee that the clean slate's going to be better than the old slate,\" says Ravitch. \"Most of the schools that will be closed are in poor or minority communities where large numbers of children are very poor and large numbers of children don't speak English. Schools undercut the opportunities for public schools, making public school students feel like \"second-class citizens.It's simply a way of avoiding the public responsibility to provide good education.\" Analytical arguments: 1. C1. by taking tests the students don't see how much they know just how much they can memorize right before taking a test; the information doesn't stick they can cram information the night before and then forget it all in a week. The purpose of education is to learn information and then use it later in the world and tests undermine that. -also standardized test don't tell the student anything they don't already know. Most students are already well aware if whether they know something or not; even if they didn't they have grades which provide more information than any test as it consists of more studies. 2. C2. we can make the term standardized tests broad enough so it covers all forms of tests. But most of the issues lie in the tests which do occur once a year as they hold the biggest impact on the students future. 3. C3. Just because a student does well on a test doesn't mean he or she know the information. Most student's don't consistently study, rather they cram all the information the night before, students who do study are much more likely to experience a block than students who cram info.

The second\"less radical and more familiar\"is that, even if standardized testing were an efficient benchmark of basic skills, the costs associated with it are too high.  \r\nStandardized tests are unnecessary because they rarely show what we don't already know. Ask any teacher and they can tell you which students can read and write. That telling usually comes in the form of letter grades or evaluations that break down progress on skills. So trust the teacher. Publish grade distributions. Locally publish a compilation of evaluation reports. Release a state or national report reviewed and verified by expert evaluators with legislative oversight.  \r\nPeople will say: \"That's crazy! Schools will fudge results. Grade data means nothing because teachers apply different standards with different values. Let's give them all one reliable test. And won't this proposal create a whole new bureaucracy?\"  \r\nAll true (except for the one test being reliable). Given high stakes and the accompanying pressure, people will game a system. And it is all too true that grades vary widely because of four factors: a teacher's conception of achievement, a teacher's sense of equity and rigor, a teacher's ability, and the composition of students.  \r\nBut people are already gaming standardized testing, sometimes criminally. And, at a basic level of competency, a grade or an evaluative report would give us as much information as we now get from standardized tests.  \r\nWe have the grade problem at my high school. In the same course or department, a B in one classroom might be an A, or even a C, in another. It's a problem for us, and, likely, a problem in most schools.  \r\n\"To sum up, we don\"t learn much from standardized accountability, and we have lost a great deal by giving it so much prominence.\"  \n  \r\nArguement 2.  \r\nStandardized Testing Undermines Teaching  \n  \n  http://www.npr.org...  \n  \r\nNo Child Left Behind has turned into a timetable for the destruction of American public education,\" she tellsFresh Air's Terry Gross. \"I had never imagined that the test would someday be turned into a blunt instrument to close schools \" or to say whether teachers are good teachers or not \" because I always knew children's test scores are far more complicated than the way they're being received today.\"  \r\nNo Child Left Behind required schools to administer yearly state standardized tests. Student progress on those tests was measured to see if the schools met their Adequate Yearly Progress goals. or AYP. Schools missing those goals for several years in a row could be restructured, replaced or shut down.  \r\n\"The whole purpose of federal law and state law should be to help schools improve, not to come in and close them down and say, 'We're going to start with a clean slate,' because there's no guarantee that the clean slate's going to be better than the old slate,\" says Ravitch. \"Most of the schools that will be closed are in poor or minority communities where large numbers of children are very poor and large numbers of children don't speak English. Schools undercut the opportunities for public schools, making public school students feel like \"second-class citizens.It's simply a way of avoiding the public responsibility to provide good education.\"  \n  \r\nAnalytical arguments:  \r\n1. C1. by taking tests the students don't see how much they know just how much they can memorize right before taking a test; the information doesn't stick they can cram information the night before and then forget it all in a week. The purpose of education is to learn information and then use it later in the world and tests undermine that.  \r\n-also standardized test don't tell the student anything they don't already know. Most students are already well aware if whether they know something or not; even if they didn't they have grades which provide more information than any test as it consists of more studies.  \n  \r\n2. C2. we can make the term standardized tests broad enough so it covers all forms of tests. But most of the issues lie in the tests which do occur once a year as they hold the biggest impact on the students future.  \n  \r\n3. C3. Just because a student does well on a test doesn't mean he or she know the information. Most student's don't consistently study, rather they cram all the information the night before, students who do study are much more likely to experience a block than students who cram info. (  http://www.galamind.com...  )  \r\n-also there are, as we know today, three types of learners, tactile, audio and visual. and test only favor visual.  \n  \r\nConclusion: Due to the lack of the pros arguments I uphold my belief to that standardized testing is NOT beneficial to k-12 education in the United States, and I urge the affirmation of the resolution.", "category": "Education", "round": 2, "debate_id": "Resolved-on-balance/1/", "idx": 47691}

In fact, many universities enforce stricter regulations than the law when it comes to student conduct and substance abuse.

I stand in opposition to the resolution; I was hoping that as my opponent you could shed some light on your supporting perspective. \nFirst: What is included in the estate? \u201cThe Gross Estate of the decedent consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death. The fair market value of these items is used, not necessarily what you paid for them or what their values were when you acquired them. The total of all of these items is your Gross Estate.\u201d (Source: https://www.forbes.com...)\nI believe that an individual has the responsibility to ensure that their wealth is distributed according to their wishes after their death. This includes ensuring that their beneficiaries receive the inheritance that they deserve without having to worry about excessive taxation. Furthermore, the government should not interfere with individuals\u2019 ability to dispose of their estates as they see fit. Ultimately, the decision of who receives the deceased\u2019s estate should remain between the deceased and their chosen beneficiaries, rather than the government.", "len_ideology": 1202, "content": "\nI thank my opponent for taking the time to craft such a thoughtful response. Before we begin, let\u2019s define our terms. By \u201cEstate\u201d we refer to the sum of a deceased person\u2019s assets, including real estate, financial instruments, and personal belongings. By \u201cInheritance Tax\u201d, also referred to as an \u201cEstate Tax,\u201d we refer to a tax levied against the Estate of a deceased person. This tax is typically imposed on the beneficiaries who receive the inheritance. My opponent argues that individuals should retain control over their estates during life and after death, however, there are valid arguments in favor of an Estate Tax.  \nFirst, an Estate Tax can generate considerable sums of revenue for governments worldwide. According to estimates published by the OECD, the average rate of taxation on inheritances in developed countries stands at around 8%, meaning that billions of dollars remain untaxed each year. Additionally, an Estate Tax can help reduce inequality between generations by ensuring that wealthy families cannot accumulate large fortunes beyond the reach of taxation. Finally, an Estate Tax can help protect vulnerable populations by ensuring that the government receives funds needed to cover essential services like healthcare and social security.

Barron Hilton (Paris Hilton's grandfather) intends to donate 97% of his estimated 2.3 billion dollar estate to charity when he dies. The foundation supports projects that provide clean water in Africa, education for blind children, and housing for the mentally ill. Its aims, based on founder Conrad Hilton's will, are \"to relieve the suffering, the distressed and the destitute.\" Conrad Hilton himself left virtually all of his fortune to the charity when he died, a charity that he founded to do great things... yet my opponent's position of being In Favor of the Estate Tax would mean that all or most of one's estate be mandated to go directly to the government upon one's passing. An estate tax is a bad idea for several reasons. First, it is more wise for an individual to invest in a trustworthy organization that they believe in than to invest in the government. Say I died and $1B of mine went to the White House. Certainly George Bush would be using that money to continue to wage war on Islamic nations - a war that I do not agree with. Therefore my money is being used to support policies that I do not. Similarly, a Conservative may not want their hard-earned money to go to programs such as Welfare or Medicaid. If I had donated my estate to a charity that collects money for breast cancer research, I would be content to know that my contribution helped to save lives, not take them. And since it is my money, I should be able to support whatever programs I choose - not leave it up to the government to decide how my money gets dispersed. Afterall, what if they agree upon a huge Dick Cheney pay increase or something just as upsetting? Another reason why an estate tax is wrong is because it can hurt the family of the individual whose estate is being taken away. For example, many people place significant value on family heirlooms, which are defined as a valued possessions that are passed down in a family through succeeding generations; articles of personal property included in an inherited estate (dictionary.com). If an estate tax were implemented, heirlooms would no longer take precedent over the government, and memories or other valuables would be lost. Rather than supporting an estate tax, I believe that an individual should be held responsible for that year's annual income taxes due in full by the following April 15th after their death just as they would if they were still alive. Aside from that, I feel that a person's will (if they have one) shall determine where the rest of their estate goes once they die.

I suspect that the spirit of Pro's argument is that the LGBT rights movement is by one measure inferior to other civil rights movements. Pro's measure is that most civil rights movements are concerned with inalienable rights, while LGBT rights movements are generally concerned with marriage equality. I would argue that marriage equality is an inalienable right, in as much that it really doesn't matter what church or state tells you. When two people decide to share their lives, they generally disregard those institutions that tell them otherwise. Neither Capulets nor Montagues could tell Romeo and Juliet they weren't married. Neither Blacks nor Whites could tell Richard and Mildred Loving they weren't married. Neither France nor the U.S could tell Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas they weren't married. Marriage is a state of mind, a promise kept by two people irregardless of doctrine, or law, or pain of death. Inalienable.

In fact, popular movements for marriage equality are a relatively new political phenomenon, built on the foundation of generations of struggle. Many of the issues addressed by LGBT movements address rights that Pro would recognize as inalienable. Let us agree that three inalienable rights are those noted in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. LIFE -There are several LGBT movements devoted to preserving the lives of LGBT around the globe. In Iran, for example, the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees helps Gays escape from a country that still retains the death penalty for homosexuality. There are 7 nations that still retain capital punishment for homosexuals and 2 countries considering adopting the death penalty for gays. All of these nations maintain activist organizations that oppose these laws and many other civil rights organizations frequently condemn these laws and work to change them. In Uganda, where a death penalty for homosexuals has overwhelming popular support, only activist appeals to global organizations and leaders has prevented the implementation of a proposed death penalty. LIBERTY \u2013 There are 76 countries where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by anything from fines, to whipping, to life imprisonment. There are hundreds of organization working to change these laws and/or free gay people serving time. Russia is a good example. Although rights for homosexuals were granted in 1917 after the Russian Revolution, discrimination against LGBT peoples has been on the rise for years and recent waves of murders, mass arrests, and anti-gay legislation has ignited a strong international backlash from LGBT activists and human rights advocates. As a result, multiple celebrities have recently cancelled tours or visits to Russia. Actor Stephen Fry initiated a movement calling for a relocation or boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics unless Russia can guarantee improved freedoms for LGBT peoples. PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS\u2013Well, this all over the place, but let\u2019s look at employment discrimination in the US, since Pro brought this up as an example of an inalienable right. Only 21 states have laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Although employment discrimination has become far less popular in the last decade, there are still employers who actively seek to screen out LGBT people and fire LGBT upon discovery. Chick-fil-a is one employer who works hard to screen out LGBT people from management and ownership opportunities. The US Military is the largest employer in the world and only changed its policy of firing LGBT employees 13 months ago.

Additionally, Pro\u2019s comparison of same-sex couples seeking marriage equality to interracial couples seeking the right to marry is flawed. Interracial marriages did not face legal opposition until very recently in American history, whereas same-sex couples have faced decades of government-sanctioned discrimination when it comes to accessing marriage licenses. Furthermore, Pro claims that LGBTQ+ rights movements are focused solely on marriage equality, yet numerous organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign exist to fight for the broader spectrum of civil liberties for queer individuals.

Let me recap why Prostitution should NOT be legal Simply allowing the sale of sex for money will not remove the problems of prostitution. Because this is a state (not federal) issue in the US, the laws that grow up around prostitution will be a patchwork of local and state regulations that encourage sex trafficking and other criminal activity. We use legislation to protect society, and the dangers of prostitution merit tighter laws and more enforcement to keep people from getting into sex trades too easily. There are many health issues of promiscuity. These are not only issues for sex workers, but for their customers, and for the intimate partners of those customers. The best way to limit harm is to keep prostitution illegal, and to find more effective methods of enforcement. Prostitution has many links to organized crime and illegal drug use. These ties will not simply disappear if prostitution were legalized. This would give more money laundering opportunities to criminal enterprise. In The US the average age of entry into street prostitution is 12-14 years .[5] Sex slavery and sex trafficking are a core part of prostitution , even in countries like Germany where it is legal. Legalization only makes the numbers larger. We have legislation to protect the vulnerable. There are age restrictions for alcohol and tobacco. Many drugs are prohibited completely. Speed limits are enforced. In Prostitution, the dangers to the workers and their clients are so high (and there are no benefits) that it needs to be completely prohibited. The prohibition against men taking advantage of women by making them prostitutes is ancient,[6] and there is no reason to think society will get better by legalizing prostitution. As the USA moves towards universal health care and socialized medicine there is an even bigger need to reduce, not increase, prostitution. As the taxpayer ends up paying the cost for medical care of prostitutes and their clients you will pay a huge cost for legalized prostitution. \" Prostitutes health care needs exceed those of most other women. \"[7] Not only is there a high price to pay for medical treatment of prostitutes, but most sexually transmitted diseases have an incubation period where the disease is infectious, but not yet diagnosed.

Even if the opponent completely wins their argument, the only thing it would be saying is that the Federal Reserve is capable of mitigating economic slowdowns, not the stimulus act.  \r\nIn short, the argument is non-relevant.  \n  \r\nContention 2B:  \r\nOnce again, we come across a problem of relevancy. However, this time, the opponent decides to bring up the international European bank and their interactions with the Federal Reserve.  \r\nNot once is the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act's usefulness mentioned.  \r\nOnce again, the argument is non-relevant.  \n  \r\nNow with the 1st contention having empirically denied, and the 2nd contentions being quite irrelevant, we come across the last argument.  \n  \r\nContention 3:  \r\nThe opponent says that more people are going to be hired.  \r\nThere is no mention of HOW or WHY this would happen. We cannot just sit and expect the stimulus act to start lowering unemployment rates, and the proposition offers no evidence as to why it WOULD lower unemployment rates.  \r\nThis argument clearly offers no clear reason as to why the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act would lower unemployment rates. The act will not decrease unemployment rates for the 2 arguments proposed by the opposition.  \n  \r\nThus, because the opponent's arguments are found to be quite irrelevant and unwarranted, negate.", "category": "Politics", "round": 0, "debate_id": "POFO-april-Topic-POFOers-only-please./1/", "idx": 40535}

{"basic": "\nArgument: We see the greatest objection appear to lie in Paradigm's usage of philosophy (specifically ontology), the nature of time, space, and matter. He makes two claims: (1) That nothing can exist without a cause, and that thus it requires spacetime to have a beginning. (2) Space and time comprise something called space and are inextricably linked to one another. On both of these claims I agree, and will seek to demonstrate how they do not assist his argument for a singularity. Let me begin by addressing (1). I agree entirely that in our daily lives every material entity has a cause. This message appears on the internet because I submitted it, for example. There are countless examples of causality everywhere in nature. However, the scope of your argument can thus only fall to things within nature, and not nature itself. That is, while everything within a set obeys a certain property (causality) it does not follow that the set itself obeys that property, especially when the property is defined by the set! (causality makes no sense without time!) This is easily demonstratable by analogy: The United Nations is comprised of various nations from around the world. Does this imply that the United Nations is itself a nation? Is the set of all even numbers itself an even number? Most certainly not. Likewise, while all objects within nature existing in time are subject to causality, this certainly does not imply that time (or nature) itself is subject to causality. In fact, it is most logical to state that time could not have begun, for the very notion of a beginning implies the existence of a time with which to compare (as coming into existence is a sequential act. Time cannot have come into existence without a time before from it to have sprung!) Secondly, I come to (2). As a physics major I have no quibbles with the notion of spacetime, and do not dispute the notion that with one necessarily follows the other. However, what I fail to recognize is how this is a problem for my argument. Paradigm asks \u201cNow, consider that there was no singularity, no point in which time began. Would time itself then become timeless? Surely not just on a philosophical level, because time outside of space means nothing, and indeed, could not exist in actuality\u2014nevermind conceptually.\u201d I addressed the issue of a beginning of time above. Without a beginning of time this does not negate the fact that causal events occur. It simply means that there was no beginning to time. An analogy may help: on a line of real numbers, there is an infinite number of these, stretching from negative infinity to infinity (which are not real numbers in themselves but denote the notion of being able to add a number on forever in either direction). Now, on the real number line I can always locate points, say, 1 and 2. And I can get from 1 to 2 by the addition of 1. Time likewise behaves similarly. There is always a finite distance between two points, while time itself is infinite in extent. The fact that space and time are linked does nothing to affect my argument: as long as space exists, time exists. If time is infinite, this just means the universe has always existed. Lastly I come to the empirical claim: that Hubble\u2019s redshift can be used to demonstrate that time itself had an origin. Hubble\u2019s redshift, for those who don\u2019t know, is a line relating galaxy distance to velocity. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it goes.

That is, while everything within a set obeys a certain property (causality) it does not follow that the set itself obeys that property, especially when the property is defined by the set! (causality makes no sense without time!) This is easily demonstrable by analogy: The United Nations is comprised of various nations from around the world. Does this imply that the United Nations is itself a nation? Is the set of all even numbers itself an even number? Most certainly not. Likewise, while all objects within nature existing in time are subject to causality, this certainly does not imply that time (or nature) itself is subject to causality. In fact, it is most logical to state that time could not have begun, for the very notion of a beginning implies the existence of a time with which to compare (as coming into existence is a sequential act. Time cannot have come into existence without a time before from it to have sprung!) Secondly, I come to (2). As a physics major I have no qualms with the notion of spacetime, and do not disagree with the notion that with one necessarily comes the other. However, what I fail to recognize is how this is a problem for my argument. Paradigm asks \"Now, consider that there was no singularity, no point in which time began. Would time itself then become timeless? Surely not just on a philosophical level, because time outside of space means nothing, and indeed, could not exist in actuality-- never mind conceptually.\" I addressed the problem with the notion of beginning of time above. Now, without a beginning of time this does not negate the fact that causal events occur. It simply means that there was no beginning to time. An analogy may help: on a line of real numbers, there is an infinite number of these, stretching from negative infinity to infinity (which are not real numbers in themselves but denote the notion of being able to add a number on forever in either direction). Now, on the real number line I can always locate points, say, 1 and 2. And I can get from 1 to 2 by the addition of 1. Time likewise behaves similarly. There is always a finite distance between two points, while time itself is infinite in extent. The fact that space and time are linked does nothing to affect my argument: as long as space exists, time exists. If time is infinite, this just means the universe has always existed. Lastly I come to the empirical claim: that Hubble's redshift can be used to demonstrate that time itself had an origin. Hubble's redshift, for those who don't know, is a line relating galaxy distance to velocity. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it goes. The conclusion is that if we bring all these galaxies back together, there must be a point in time that they were all smashed together into a single point, the Big Bang singularity. There are multiple problems with deducing this: Hubble's Law (which results in this relationship) in it's simplest formulation is based off of a Newtonian metric, which, while useful for many astronomical calculations, becomes increasingly useless as both relativity and quantum mechanics come into play. Likewise, more complicated and accurate formulations take into account relativity, but leave out the play of quantum mechanics. This is for good reason, quantum effects do not mean anything until we get to a region where Hubble's Law is entirely useless. While great for galaxies, we are talking about a time when all of space was contained within a region smaller than a proton. The fundamental forces were united and behaved in a manner different than what Hubble's Law is theoretically based off of. And most importantly, gravity is quantized, which greatly affects the expansion of space (as energy density results in a gravitational tug, and energy density was quite high during the pre-Planck universe.) Extrapolation of Hubble's Law prior to (or during) the inflationary epoch is also unwarranted. This is because while the Hubble relationship took into account some basic relativity, the metric involved in Inflation is quite different and based on different parameters. We certainly do not apply the inflation metric past the point where it approximates the Hubble metric, nor should we do the opposite and apply Hubble where he's not correct. Likewise, prior to inflation gravity itself is quantized, and this means we shouldn't apply either Hubble or Inflationary metrics without great hesitation! Neither of these metrics are quantized, which means neither of these metrics are appropriate during pre-Planck era work.", "label": 0, "author": "Lucretius", "original_text": "\n  \r\nThanks for taking up the debate! I'll get right into addressing your criticisms (written as if to a third party):  \n  \r\nWe see the greatest objection appear to lie in Paradigm's usage of philosophy (specifically ontology), the nature of time, space, and matter.

This can be further seen in the audition procedure when the producers pick which contestents get to sing for the judges. MSNBC Explains, \"During the auditions, the judges don't show up until the last day or two, and only see about 100 people who have already been screened, first by producers (who see small groups and narrow the contestants to a few hundred) and then by the show's executive producers. So the wannabe Idols first have to try out in groups of four for a number of random producers. Then, they try out one-by-one in front of the executive producers. And finally, they try out in front of our favorite boozehound and her cohorts. This is why so many people lose their jobs to try out for the show; they have to attend auditions for a week before they even know if they're going to Hollywood. So what happens during these earlier auditions? Well for one thing, those obnoxious song montages that usually end the episodes are filmed then. It's not a coincidence that all of the bad singers decided to sing the same song. Jennifer Sieminski, who made it to Hollywood during American Idol's fifth season, admits that those segments are not \"even recorded in front of Simon, Paula and Randy.\" Apparently, each city has a \"city song\" that everyone must sing so that the producers can make the lame montages. The producers even force the people who audition to wear the same clothes to each audition so the viewers at home think the auditions all took place over the span of 1 or 2 days. They messed up with Crystal Parizanski, the overly tan girl who auditioned in Chicago for American Idol 5, who was wearing a completely different outfit during the \"Lady Marmalade\" montage at the end of the episode. This obviously showed that she had been there for at least a few days.\" Another flaw with the audition procedure is that good singers aren't always picked. \"As we previously mentioned, the first round of auditions takes place in front of a group producers at a table, who likely aren't even very qualified to judge a competition (then again, this never stopped Simon, Paula, and Randy).

In regards to the resolution, I believe that God does indeed possess objective reality and can be discussed in an effective manner through debate. To begin, let me explain how I understand \u201cobjective\u201d when used in relation to God. When speaking about God, objectivity refers to His immutable nature; His attributes (such as love, justice, mercy) remain unchanged regardless of culture, time period, or individual belief. These characteristics form the foundation of who God is and provide a basis for discussion. Additionally, these qualities can be explored further through philosophical and theological inquiry. As Christians, we also recognize that God transcends human understanding and is beyond comprehension (Romans 11:33). Despite this, we can still explore aspects of Him through logical discourse. Furthermore, due to the transcendence of God, any discussion regarding His existence must take into consideration both the subjective and objective elements of faith. Ultimately, I believe that God can be effectively discussed in debate provided that both sides acknowledge the inherent complexity of the subject matter.", "len_all": 1276, "text": "I'm slighty disappointed because I was looking forward to this debate, but I appreciate Pro's concession and am excited to see that I may have changed his mind on this issue. That, after all, is what we strive for with debate, and it warms my heart that I was able to do that. For fun, I'm going to respond to some of the points that Pro made in the last two rounds. Controversial Topic I don't deny that the topic of God's existence is a popular or even controversial topic that exictes many member's, and rightfully so. It's a pervasive, thought-provoking question that we inescapable will come to face with at some point or another in contemplating our mortality. However, it is the fact that it *is* a controversial topic which ought to preclude us from making it a big issue: they say that religion and politics are the touchy subjects that we ought not discuss at the dining room table for a reason. People hold starkly different positions on the existence of a deity or even their conceptions of a deity, so attempting to conceptualize this notion by way of, as Pro suggests, O3 is far oversimplifying the issue. The O3 conception leaves out omnipresence, to name one, and scientific debates which focus on pinpointing the first cause would often focus on a deistic god. This doesn't even account for the pantheistic god that Christopher Langan and many others argue for. The point is, precisely because the issue is so pervasive and widespread is why it should not be a Big Issue. It cannot be properly pinned down nor precisely delineated, so it wold necessarily give rise to ambiguity and contentious kerfuffles among members, as well as highly variable framework analyses. The topic is *not* agreeable, as Pro contends. It will necessarily lead to the clashing of strong personalities, and well that it desirable at times, we should be promoting it with respect to something productive and conducive to intellectual advancement--that cannot possibly be the case with something as elusive and as difficult to formalize as \"god.\" Ambiguity Pro contends that, in spite of your religion, conceptions of God will tend to converge to O3. I have already demonstrated why this will not be the case of light of deism, pantheism, and polytheism. People even within different sects of Christianity, or of varying degrees of devoutness, may have differing views as to God's wraith and the role of the Old Testament of the Bible in their lives and religion. Existence Pro seems to have missed my point with respect to existence. Surely people could debate whether God's existence matters, but that is non-topical to our discussion at hand because the Big Issue would be \"Does God exist?\" He seems to concede, with this point, that there is a distinction between objective and subjective existence, which would necessarily make it extremely difficult and near-impossible to adequately define God such that we could establish a universal, DDO-wide definition. Truth Value Pro seems to concede that God doesn't have truth value, but then tries to liken the issue to gay marriage. However, as I mentioned in the last round, gay marriage involves appeals to morality as well as objective and empirical facts, such as sociological research on child rearing and adoption. Philosophical arguments to the effect of free will versus omniscience and the problem of evil could make for fascinating debates, but that would require defining God as 03, which would necessarily preclude various conceptions of God and disenfranchise a host of people with fundamentally different views.

The Death Penalty deters murder Until relatively recently there was little consensus on the impact of the death penalty on murder rates, however in the last decade, nine of twelve referenced academic studies by notable economists concluded that the death penalty does, in fact, deter murders[1]. Among the conclusions of those studies was one that determined each execution deters an average of 18 murders [2]. Other studies have estimated the deterred murders per execution at three, five and 14[3]. A controversial study conducted to evaluate the evidence of the \"innocent executed\" is the Bedau-Radelet Study. The study concluded that 23 innocent persons had been executed since 1900. However, the studies methodology was so flawed that at least 12 of those cases had no evidence of innocence and substantial evidence of guilt[4]. The remaining 11 cases represent 0.14% of the 7,800 executions which have taken place since 1900. And, there is, in fact, no proof that those 11 executed were innocent. Even if one uses the apparently most conservative numbers, we can calculate that the death penalty has deterred 7,800*3=~23400 murders of innocents and executed 11 innocents (which have not been conclusively proved innocent either). Thus, it is simply not true that a staggering number of innocent persons have been executed, as previously noted, yet even if it where true, the number of innocent lives saved by the death penalty exceed those that have been executed by a factor of ~20000%. Con argues that the state should not hold power over others, which contradicts the very nature and function of the state: to distribute power and resources.

The Death Penalty does not act as a deterrent According to several recent studies, the death penalty does not act as a deterrent for potential criminals[1], meaning that the risk of being caught is still higher than the reward of avoiding capital punishment. Furthermore, executing people is expensive, costing more than keeping someone in prison for life[2]. Additionally, the possibility of wrongful convictions and unequal application of the death penalty makes its use unacceptable. Capital punishment perpetuates violence and encourages revenge rather than rehabilitation. It also disproportionately affects members of minorities and the poor, who are more likely to be accused of crimes and less able to afford adequate legal representation.

Firstly, let us look at the definition of 'anti-human': opposed to or hostile towards humanity; unkind or unfair to people. My opponent argues that a concept does not possess the mental capacity to be anti-human, however, concepts can still act upon one another and affect others. Even though a concept itself might not have malicious intentions, it could still cause harm if it influences someone to behave in an antagonistic manner. Secondly, with regards to the economy, my opponent states that \u201cpeople do not always cooperate\u201d. However, this misses the point entirely \u2013 the economy works best when people DO cooperate, otherwise it breaks down into chaos. Furthermore, my opponent\u2019s argument regarding the farmer ignores the fact that many people already cooperate within societies today, such as through trade networks and mutual aid agreements. Finally, my opponent claims that \u201cforcing\u201d people to become something they don\u2019t want to be is wrong, yet this is exactly what capitalism does every single day \u2013 forces people to sell their labour for a wage, regardless of whether or not they actually want to do it. In conclusion, a concept CAN be anti-human, as it can influence individuals to act in ways which are detrimental to human interests, and forcing people to do things they don\u2019t want to do is certainly not fair.", "len_basic": 1483, "len_orig": 3472, "ideology": "\nArgument: For the sake of 5 rounds I will accept this new debate. But for the ultimate lack of time I will have to keep this short. A concept cannot have a brain either. Therefore a CONCEPT cannot be either anti-human/ evil.

Because of this I feel the rest is of topic, but I'll refute the points anyway, for the sake of debating. \"If there was no economy, and everyone cooperated, they would not starve\" People do not always cooperate. People are greedy and cruel sometimes. People crave power. People are sometimes insane. All of these aspects of people make this cooperation impossible. Its a nice idea, the thought of roughly 6.5 billion people working together. But it is simply impossible. For this to work and all 6.5 billion people getting food most people would have to cooperate. For example farmers would have to give away surplus food to other neighbors. Now, what if the farmer was self sufficient? He has enough food to keep himself and his family going, they have a well of water, their house is built from the wood of surrounding trees, their clothes are made from cattle skins, and they have enough cattle, each in herds of about 20 or so, and of various breeds and variety's (so the chances of them getting diseases and spreading them to all cattle are an impossibility).

Legalizing same-sex marriage will not affect traditional marriage rates due to the fact that marriage is already becoming increasingly less common among young adults. 3. Same-sex marriage is not unconstitutional as the fourteenth amendment does not specifically define who has the right to marry nor does it provide any specific guidelines regarding what constitutes marriage. Rather, the court ruled that the Constitution \u201cleaves room for different understandings\u201d of marriage. (Zablocki v. Redhail)  4.

Legally recognizing same-sex relationships would provide stability and security to individuals within such relationships, allowing them to access social welfare programs and other legal protections available to traditional families (Gates et al., 2016). 3. Same-sex marriage is not unconstitutional, as the Fourteenth Amendment does not specifically define who has the right to marry nor does it limit the rights of those who can marry (Zablocki v. Redhail, 1978). 4. Allowing same-sex couples to marry will not harm society or create any new \u201cfamily\u201d units, instead it will open doors for stable homes where children can be raised in safe environments, benefiting the overall growth of our nation (Bridges Ahead, 2016).", "len_ideology": 981, "content": "\nArgument: The government should recognize same-sex marriage due to economic benefits, legal protections, and equality under the law. Firstly, economists estimate that recognizing same-sex marriage would bring in an additional $3 billion dollars annually in federal tax revenue (Gates et al., 2016). This money could be used to fund vital services such as healthcare and housing, helping to reduce inequality within LGBTQ+ communities. Secondly, same-sex married couples currently face significant legal disparities when compared to their heterosexual counterparts; denying them recognition of their relationships puts these individuals at greater risk of financial instability and other forms of discrimination (Keller & Keller, 2019). Finally, granting full recognition to same-sex marriage is essential for achieving true equality under the law. All people deserve to be treated equally regardless of sexual orientation, and allowing same-sex couples to wed will move us closer towards realising this goal.", "len_content": 1009, "style": "\nArgument: 1. The economic benefits of marriage are often exaggerated since over 72% of married couples end up in debt of more than $35,000 which is only paid off in 44% of cases according to an Economist article from June 18, 2010.  2. Marriage is traditionally defined as a legal or formal union between a man and woman as partners in a relationship, however the contemporary notion of \u201cmarriage\u201d may be interpreted differently and thus should not be considered offensive. 3. It is not unconstitutional because the fourteenth amendment does not specifically define who has the right to marry nor does it provide any details about what constitutes a valid marriage. This was made clear in the Zablocki v. Redhail case where the jury could not come to a consensus regarding the definition of marriage. 4. Same-sex unions cannot create families, they can only be naturally infertile unions as the traditional family is essential in helping raise children and benefitting the state.

Legally recognizing same-sex marriage would not go against any religious beliefs due to the fact that marriage is defined as \u201ca legally or formally recognized union of two people\u201d (Merriam Webster) rather than solely between a man and woman. 3. Same-sex marriage is not unconstitutional as the Fourteenth Amendment does not specifically define who has the right to marry nor does it provide details about what constitutes a valid marriage. Instead, the Supreme Court ruled in the Zablocki v. Redhail case that the Constitution was too ambiguous to make such decisions (Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders). 4. Allowing same-sex marriage will not harm traditional families as there are many nontraditional families that can still raise healthy, productive citizens (Boston Globe).

{"basic": "\nTransformation: \nI will gladly accept your debate. However, I must point out that religion should have no bearing on civil rights, especially when it comes to matters regarding sexuality. The definition of \"sexual addiction\", while helpful in understanding certain aspects of human behavior, does not accurately define every instance of non-traditional sexual practices. Furthermore, even if these activities were classified as addictions, this would still not justify discrimination against those engaging in them. As for taboo sexual acts, these are often performed between consenting adults in private and thus should remain private. Lastly, children should never be exposed to such acts, regardless of the participants\u2019 gender identities.", "len_basic": 743, "len_orig": 2036, "ideology": "\nArgument: Sexual addiction is a real thing, as evidenced by its inclusion in the DSM-V. It is characterized by compulsive engagement in sexual activities despite negative consequences, including risky behavior like unprotected sex and multiple partners. This applies equally to hetero and homosexual individuals. While some may argue that these activities are a matter of personal preference, this does not change the fact that they can cause significant harm both physically and mentally. \n  \nRebuttal: You are right; sexual addiction is a real thing. However, it does not apply equally to everyone. The DSM-V only includes criteria for diagnosing sexual addiction in adult men, which suggests that it might not be applicable to other demographics. Additionally, while risky behaviour like unprotected sex and multiple partners can certainly lead to physical and mental health issues, it is not always the case. Some people may freely choose to take these risks and still enjoy safe and satisfying relationships. Therefore, to claim that these activities are always indicators of addictions is too broad of a generalization.", "len_ideology": 1126, "content": "\nArgument: \nI would like to start off by saying that while I understand where you\u2019re coming from with this argument, I believe that sexual addiction does play a role in defining certain \u201ctaboo\u201d sexual activities. As stated in the Merriam Webster dictionary, sexual addiction is \u201cthe state of being excessively preoccupied with sexual fantasies and behaviors to the point of losing control over these behaviors\u201d. This means that even if someone knows something is wrong or goes against societal norms, they continue to partake in the behavior due to an uncontrollable obsession. For example, some individuals may engage in BDSM activities which involve elements of dominance/submission, bondage, and discipline; however, those involved in the lifestyle know that these practices can become compulsive and lead to an addiction. In addition, many couples partaking in swinging or open relationships claim that the feeling of excitement and risk taking leads to an addictive cycle as well. While these activities may seem taboo or risky, they are often done so within the confines of a loving relationship and with full consent between both parties. Ultimately, although sexual addiction may not define every single \u201ctaboo\u201d sexual activity, it certainly plays a factor in why some individuals partake in them.", "len_content": 1305, "style": "\nArgument: \nI would like to start off by saying that while I understand where you\u2019re coming from, I believe that sexual addiction does play a role in this discussion. The reason why is because sexual addiction is often associated with compulsive behavior which leads to negative consequences. This means that even if someone is engaging in these \u201ctaboo\u201d activities within the confines of a relationship, it can still lead to issues such as decreased performance at work or school, increased risk of STDs/STIs, and interpersonal problems due to secrecy and lies. Additionally, many individuals who struggle with sexual addiction report feeling shame, guilt, and distress about their behaviors, indicating that there is something inherently wrong with them despite the fact that they may enjoy the physical sensations associated with certain activities. Ultimately, I believe that sexual addiction plays a crucial role in understanding why some individuals might seek out these types of activities, regardless of the gender of their partner(s).", "len_style": 1042, "ideology-content": "\nArgument: Sexual addiction is a real thing and it does exist. It is characterized by intense focus on sexual behavior which takes precedence over other activities and causes significant distress or impairment in daily life. This includes both hetero and homosexual individuals. People who suffer from this disorder often times struggle with controlling their behavior and may even engage in risky sexual practices without considering the consequences. In addition, research shows that those suffering from sexual addiction often report feeling shame, guilt, and anxiety related to their behavior. Therefore, comparing taboo sexual acts to something as serious as sexual addiction is completely valid.  Additionally, while some sexual acts may be a choice, many others are driven by underlying issues like trauma, low self esteem, or unresolved emotional pain. To assume otherwise would be naive.", "len_ideology-content": 896, "ideology-style": "\nArgument: \nI would like to start off by saying that while I understand where you\u2019re coming from, I disagree with your stance on this issue. Firstly, let us define \u201caddiction\u201d as pertaining to something excessive or compulsively done despite harmful consequences; so, yes, some may argue that certain sexual activities can become an obsession or even an addiction due to its frequent occurrence. However, this does not take away from the fact that these activities are still consensual between adults and thus should remain legal. In addition, many countries around the world recognize the importance of protecting LGBTQ+ individuals and ensuring their safety, which includes allowing them to freely express themselves without fear of discrimination or judgement. Furthermore, research shows that allowing same-sex couples to marry actually strengthen society rather than weakening it. Therefore, I believe that legally recognizing same-sex marriage is beneficial both socially and economically.", "len_ideology-style": 995, "all": "\nArgument: \nI would like to start off by saying that while I understand where you\u2019re coming from with this argument, I believe that sexual addiction does play a role in some cases. While it may not apply to every single instance of \u201ctaboo\u201d sexual behavior, it does exist as a valid concept within our society and should not be discounted so easily. Furthermore, even if we were to assume that these activities are purely voluntary choices made without external influence, that still wouldn\u2019t negate the fact that certain individuals are affected by them. As stated before, sexuality is something that evolved over time, and thus many aspects of it remain hardwired into our brains. This means that certain actions can trigger intense feelings of pleasure or arousal which can lead to compulsive behavior; this is especially true for those who already have a predisposition towards certain types of sexual activities. In other words, just because someone chooses to partake in taboo sexual behavior does not mean that they aren\u2019t suffering from an underlying issue related to addiction. Ultimately, I believe that both points of view need to be taken into consideration when discussing topics such as this.", "len_all": 1205, "text": "I will gladly accept your debate.

Socrates's Banana \n\nThe story goes that once upon a time, Socrates was walking around Athens and saw a beautiful woman selling bananas. He asked her why she had chosen to sell them rather than something else, and she replied that she liked the way bananas made people feel. She told him that whenever someone bought a banana from her, their face lit up and they seemed to forget all their worries. Socrates thought about this for a moment and realized that this was true - when he took a bite of the sweet fruit, he felt happy and carefree. From then on, Socrates always carried a few bananas with him wherever he went, to remind himself to be joyful and appreciative of life\u2019s simple pleasures.", "len_basic": 751, "len_orig": 4934, "ideology": "\nArgument: I would like to start off by thanking SocialPinko for accepting this debate. Before I continue, let me make something clear; I believe that homosexuals deserve respect, love and equality just like every other human being. However, I don\u2019t believe that homosexual acts are inherently good or evil - rather, I believe that these acts are morally neutral and that their morality depends entirely upon the context and circumstances surrounding them. To say that homosexual acts are always wrong is just as incorrect as saying that they are always right. Instead, we need to look at each situation individually and determine what is best for those involved. With that in mind, I urge you to consider the potential benefits of allowing people to express themselves authentically, regardless of their sexual orientation. Thank you again for this opportunity!", "len_ideology": 862, "content": "\nI would like to start off by saying that I greatly admire SocialPinko\u2019s ability to articulate complex ideas clearly and succinctly. He makes some great points, and I look forward to engaging them. Before getting into the substance of the debate, let me address something SocialPinko mentioned near the end - the idea that debates should not be reduced to \u201can intellectual competition or a battle of logic and argumentation.\u201d While I certainly agree that debates should strive to go beyond mere logical battles, I don\u2019t believe that this automatically leads us away from having winners and losers. Debate is still a contest, after all; it\u2019s simply a contest based on more than just pure reason. That being said, I do think that debaters should always keep their audience in mind and try to make sure that their arguments are presented in a way that is accessible and understandable to those listening. With that in mind, let\u2019s move onto the actual debate! \n\nThe resolution states that \u201chomosexual acts are immoral\u201d. As defined by Webster\u2019s dictionary, \u2018morale\u2019 refers to \u201cthe quality of being moral\u201d, whereas \u2018immoral\u2019 refers to \u201cnot conforming to accepted standards of behavior; lacking integrity; dishonest or evil\u201d. Therefore, before we can determine if homosexual acts are immoral, we need to define what we mean by \u2018morality\u2019. To many people, morality is synonymous with religion \u2013 religious texts often serve as the primary source of morality. However, this begs the question \u2013 whose religion? There are countless religions around the world, each with their own unique beliefs and values. How can any single religion claim to represent objective truth, let alone objectively determine what is and isn\u2019t moral? Furthermore, even if we could reach a consensus on what is considered moral according to a particular religion, how do we apply this across cultures? Different cultural norms and customs may conflict with certain aspects of a given religion\u2019s interpretation of morality. Ultimately, determining whether or not homosexual acts are immoral requires making value judgments that cannot easily be agreed upon.  \n\nIn addition to relying too heavily on religion, traditional approaches to morality tend to be overly simplistic and black-and-white. They fail to recognize the complexity of human behavior and the fact that morality is highly subjective. Human actions are influenced by multiple factors, including culture, context, and individual experience. Morality, then, needs to be flexible enough to accommodate these nuances and allow room for individuals to make their own decisions regarding what is right and wrong. We cannot rely solely on external sources, such as religion or tradition, to dictate what is acceptable behavior. Instead, we need to focus on developing our own understanding of morality and use that to guide our decision-making process. \n\nUltimately, I believe that homosexual acts are not inherently immoral. Rather, what makes an act immoral depends entirely on the situation and the intent behind it. Everyone has the right to decide for themselves what behaviors they find acceptable and unacceptable, without fear of judgment or persecution. By focusing on promoting autonomy and self-determination, rather than policing people\u2019s sexual choices, society can become more accepting and tolerant of diversity.", "len_content": 3347, "style": "\nArgumentum ad Hominem - Appealing to Authority\nThe fallacy of appealing to authority occurs when an individual attempts to bolster their argument by associating themselves or another person with an authority figure. This type of appeal to authority is often used to try to give greater weight to an otherwise weak argument. By linking oneself or another person to an established expert or source of knowledge, this type of argument hopes to gain credibility without actually having to support the claim itself. \n\nIn this example, the debater is attempting to link himself to an authority figure by mentioning a famous philosopher. By doing so, the debater hopes to add validity to his argument and make it seem more convincing.

I'm not here to win points by technicalities, my goal is not even to win a debate (though I will be trying my best to do so). My goal here is to tackle this issue at its very foundation and hopefully provide a sound argument for my position, while simultaneously demonstrating that the counter position is not intellectually tenable. I will be taking the Pro position in this debate and will be defending the resolution that \"homosexual acts are immoral\". DEFINITIONS I am in full agreement with Con in his definition of homosexual acts, ie \"Homosexual acts refer to consensual sex acts between two or more members of the same sex.\" Now the definition of the term \"immoral\" is where the debate really is. I appreciate Con's definition as well as his following statement that shows that he is aware that he and I will have differing views on what constitutes immorality. I hope the readers will take this important detail into account. Now on to my argument.. This debate is not about whether or not homosexuality is a defect in nature, nor is this debate about whether homosexual acts should be legal or illegal. Those are different issues. This debate is about whether or not homosexuality, or homosexual acts to be specific, are immoral. This is a debate about a moral or ethical issue. This is important to note because morality and ethics transcend what is legal and what is natural. Though I chose to accept to defend the resolution that \"homosexual acts are immoral\", Con was the one who formulated this resolution. What I want to point out here is that Con and I both are presupposing a moral standard on which we can gauge what is immoral and therefore ground this debate. Con stated that \"For an action to be immoral means that it is contrary to right or to moral conduct.\" This shows that Con will be arguing against the resolution on the basis of a moral standard. Con did however state that him and I \"will no doubt have differing views on what constitute immorality\". I very much appreciated this statement of his and though I think this is where the debate will get tricky, I hope that Con and I will get somewhere with this during our debate. ARGUMENT Con was exactly right when he said that we will no doubt have differing views on what constitutes immorality so I will begin my argument by putting forward my view, which is the Biblical view on morality as interpreted by Reformed Protestantism. God is absolute, with an unchanging moral character and is the standard of morality. Anything that is contrary to his absolute, unchanging character is therefore immoral. His commands and his word that he revealed through natural revelation and special revelation, ie. scripture, are expressions of his character and are therefore absolute, unchanging, and more importantly AUTHORITATIVE and binding. P1 God and His word is the standard of morality P2 The word of God teaches that homosexual acts are immoral C Homosexual acts are immoral Now as demonstrated above, WITHIN the Christian system, homosexual acts are indeed immoral. I think it is safe to assume that Con has a different view on morality, and I am very interested to know which system of ethics he subscribes to, whether it's that of Kant's, Bentham, Sarte, Aristotle, Nietzsche, a combination of 2 or more, or maybe someone else, and maybe even his own philosophy of ethics. It does not really matter what system of morality he will present, what matters and what is necessary is that the system is not arbitrary, and that the system is binding. For Con to refute the resolution, he can either: 1. Somehow show that homosexual acts are not immoral within the Christian system. 2. Provide an alternative moral standard that I and everyone else are necessarily bound to. In other words, a moral system in which I MUST accept that homosexual acts are not immoral. Con can also argue that absolute moral standards do not exist altogether, therefore, homosexual acts are not absolutely immoral, since there is no such thing as \"immorality\". In this case, we would just be arguing on who's personal OPINION is better, not unlike arguing which favorite color is better. In conclusion, the statement that \"homosexual acts are immoral\" presupposes a moral standard. I have provided a moral system that is absolute, universal unchanging, authoritative, and binding, and in which the resolution is supported.

He did not provide an adequate response, and thus I believe that it is safe to assume that governments SHOULD regulate the media in this situation. \n\nThirdly, although media corruption may be a valid concern, it pales in comparison to the risk of not regulating the media. Governments already have several measures in place to prevent media corruption, such as laws against bribery and defamation. Furthermore, if media organizations are found to be acting maliciously and in violation of the law, they can be held accountable through existing legal channels. Thus, the threat of media corruption should not serve as an excuse for not regulating the media. \n\nFinally, even if some media organizations abuse their newfound powers under the proposed regulations, the overall benefits to national security far exceed the costs.

Governments therefore have every right to step in and make sure that the media is acting in accordance with accepted standards of behavior. \n\nFinally, those who oppose government interference often cite the potential for abuse and misuse of power. To counteract this concern, strong regulatory frameworks need to be put into place which clearly define acceptable practices and provide mechanisms for citizens to voice their grievances. Ultimately, proper oversight of the media can help ensure both a healthy democracy and a safe society.", "len_ideology-content": 1979, "ideology-style": "\nArgument: During this round, there have been a lot of arguments presented, but now I would like to really break down why governments ought to have to regulate the media.

My question in my last speech went unanswered. \u2013 In my last speech I asked my opponent to answer a very simple question. I asked that if we were planning to invade a nation and the media found out when and where, would you let them leak the information or would you regulate them? This question was quite simple, yet my opponent never replied to it. Don\u2019t let him \u201ckind of\u201d answer this in his next speech because I would then have no chance to reply.Basically, what you must understand is that OBVIOUSLY you would tell them not to report this because the consequence of them reporting it (and having their freedom of the press) would be far greater than the risk of not revealing it. In other words, you MUST realize that these regulations ARE for national security, something that is much more important than freedom to the press. If you vote for me on anything, vote for that. \n  3. His biggest argument is only that governments have corruption. \u2013 Throughout this round, his main argument has been that governments have too much corruption. However,Media corruption is NOT as dangerous as the government regulations. Sure, I agree that the government CAN go too far with this regulation, BUT media WILL definitely go too far with their right to report ANYTHING they find from the government. Its the same reason why there are five security levels in the government (which went unargued) and is similar to why they cannot show pornography and curse on their reports.These regulations take away people\u2019s right to the press, BUT these small restrictions still serve the better interests of the society, especially regarding this resolution, I am merely extending that right to protect the most important thing we have, our national security. \n  4. Even a corrupt government will protect national security with regulations.\u2013 What you must recognize is that even the most corrupt government can be successful in protecting their country, BUT a nation without the right to regulate the media, THEN BECOMES INCAPABLE OF DOING THIS.Still though, a government would NEVER be foolish enough not to keep certain things a secret, such as where and when we are invading a nation, or when the world will end.

No one would want to do any more work if the world were to end. \u2013 I guess I assumed too much when I said that everything would crash. I assumed that if people were to know that they would be dead in 6 months, that they would stop going to school and work, and would ONLY care about Number 1, themselves\u2026 And with NO ONE working or AT LEAST not very many people working, there would be NOTHING TO SUPPORT ANYTHING.The economy AS WE KNOW IT would be GONE and everyone would ONLY become interested in their own interest which would mean the \u201cCRASHING\u201d of everything. \n  \nIn conclusion, you vote for all of the previously mentioned reasons.

Moreover, joining the EU allows countries to take advantage of further international relationships and potential opportunities. [2] [3] Finally, leaving the EU would put Croatia at a great disadvantage compared to its neighbouring states who remain members.

From what I have gathered from these sources is that Croatian politics, since the process of joining the EU, have been becoming increasingly less corrupt.

You have provided evidence from both scripture and nature to support your claim that God is morally perfect and should therefore want to reduce suffering. However, one potential counterargument could be that while God may not want us to suffer, He allows it because His greater plan requires it. For instance, allowing some people to experience hardship might be necessary for them to learn important lessons or gain compassion. Additionally, God may simply not be able to intervene due to certain rules or limitations.", "len_basic": 583, "len_orig": 1902, "ideology": "\nArgument: I just finished a debate on this topic, but I think it's an interesting topic, so I'm doing it again.

Since he is omnipotent, he has the tools to stop the suffering and since he is omniscient, he knows where the suffering is and the best way to stop it.

My first contention is that stairs are safer. They are incredibly strong and able to stand up against natural disasters like earthquakes and floods far better than elevators can. According to Elcosh.com, the 173 fatalities due to work around/in elevators - roughly 14 annually - were mostly caused by falls into the shaft. Stairs have zero such risks, and will always function properly, unlike elevators, which require regular maintenance and inspections to keep running. Elevators lead to 14 preventable deaths every year on average, and countless injuries. My second contention is that stairs make people healthier. Walking up and down stairs instead of taking the convenient option (elevator) helps build strength in your leg muscles. Many individuals who work in tall office buildings (which usually have plenty of elevators) are stuck at their desk all day and need additional physical activity. Thus, stair climbing provides great exercise, burn calories, and builds lean mass. Therefore, stairs are clearly superior to elevators when it comes to overall wellness. Finally, my third contention is that stairs cost significantly less than elevators. The typical elevator installation runs around $25,000, excluding maintenance and inspection expenses. In contrast, the average set of stairs costs just $7500. That\u2019s a huge difference, and the extra funds could definitely be utilized elsewhere.

Additionally, if an emergency situation arises where people must evacuate quickly, an elevator provides a faster means of transportation compared to climbing stairs.

Why is it that we continue to try what isn't working. Which is why I must agree with... -Resolved- In the United States, minor jail time ought to be replaced with significant rehabilitation. This leads me to my value for this round... I. Value- Societal Welfare -Within this round, the only question is what provides a better solution for the society. What you have to see is that when we use rehabilitation over just a night in jail, they will commit crimes less often and if I can prove that, I will save tax money and the use of crimes therefore increasing societal welfare or the good of the society. In attempting to achieve this, there is only one way to achieve this within this resolution... II. Criterion- Appropriate Punishment -It is simple to make the connection of appropriate punishment as being significant rehabilitation. What you have to see is that when we get appropriate punishment, then societal welfare is right around the corner. The difference between Pro and Con in this resolution is simply the method of punishment. In most cases, a night in jail is not significant enough to stop from future misbehavior, but if you put them into rehab clinics, it is punishment and it does teach them why they should not act inappropriately in the future. III. Minor Jail time is not an appropriate punishment. A. Minor Jail time is not a great enough incentive to stop repeat offenders. -What you have to see is that while spending a day or two in prison is a slap on the wrist, it is not a great enough incentive to not try it again. In the end of due process, what the society truly wants is fewer crimes, not hard core punishment such as jail time would do. In other words, in order to truly support societal welfare, we must have appropriate punishment such as significant rehabilitation. B. Minor Jail time does not fit the crime committed. -While many people would insist on a day in prison being enough of a punishment for perhaps shoplifting or a DUI... it simply is not. When you were growing out, your parents would be more concerned that you learned your lesson rather than you being punished, but simply put, minor jail time does not fit any sort of crime big or small, it doesn't teach anything. IV. Significant rehabilitation is an appropriate punishment. A. Significant rehabilitation is a punishment for the common criminal. -What do you think is the last thing that a common criminal would want to happen after being caught doing a crime? Being talked to about it of course! If there is ever an incentive to not commit a crime, it isn't a bad meal on a stiff bed (such would be the case of minor jail time) but it would be 20 hours of talking to awkward councilors instead. Therefore, significant rehab has all the benefits of minor jail time. B. Significant rehabilitation gives a chance for the common criminal to be a regular citizen again. -The final and most important argument in my case is simply that rehab does give a chance for the common criminal to finally be a good citizen (thus supporting societal welfare). It may even be the first time in these peoples lives that they actually understand why you do or do not do certain things. What you have to see is that even if I prove that one more person is saved by my significant rehabilitation, and then I prove that fewer of the costs will appear. -In the end- The appropriate punishment at the end of this case and round simply has to be significant rehabilitation. It offers few of the costs (IV B) and all of the benefits (IV A). It offers a chance for common criminals to become common citizens thus increasing the societal welfare and overall increasing general moral goals and standards.

First, I will respond to some points made in Pro\u2019s concluding remarks. He claims that \u201cSTV allows one to vote for a candidate within one\u2019s party\u201d; however, this is true only when using single transferable vote, which is not the type of proportional representation employed in the United Kingdom. Additionally, he states that \u201cplurality promotes political apathy\u201d, yet research shows that citizens in countries employing proportional representation are less likely to participate in elections due to its perceived lack of impact [1]. Furthermore, Pro argues that \u201cPR makes tactical voting unnecessary\u201d. While this may be true in certain instances, it does not negate the fact that tactical voting remains necessary in many cases, particularly those involving multi-seat districts. Lastly, Pro mentions that \u201cthe largest constituency is 110,000 (second largest 90,000) and the smallest 55,000,\u201d implying that large geographic disparities between constituencies do not matter. However, this fails to recognize that the size of a constituency should be taken into consideration alongside its location \u2013 a rural area with fewer people spread across a wide area may require greater representation than an urban area with more people packed into a smaller space. Ultimately, Pro has failed to demonstrate why the current British electoral system is superior to proportional representation. His arguments regarding the advantages of first past the post fail to acknowledge the drawbacks associated with it, including the disproportionate allocation of seats, the marginalization of certain groups, and the potential for manipulation. Meanwhile, Pro offers few concrete examples demonstrating the benefits of proportional representation and fails to refute the key points raised by Con. Therefore, I urge the judges to reject Pro\u2019s case and award the round to Con.\n\n### Rebuttal\n\nPro argued that the current British electoral system is inferior to proportional representation, citing several drawbacks such as disproportional allocations of seats, marginalisation of certain groups, and potential for manipulation. In response, I argue that Pro provided no evidence to support his assertions that proportional representation is superior to the current British electoral system. On the contrary, numerous studies have shown that proportional representation increases voter engagement and trust in government, reduces extremist tendencies among candidates, and encourages coalition building amongst different parties [2][3][4]. Furthermore, proportional representation eliminates the need for costly and often corruptive gerrymandering practices. Thus, I contend that Pro has failed to demonstrate why the current British electoral system is inferior to proportional representation.", "len_ideology-content": 2880, "ideology-style": "\nArgument: I shall address my opponent's rebuttals whilst reinforcing my own arguments:  \nMy opponent claims that the Lib Dems come second in lots of constituencies, however, this does not necessarily indicate a lack of success; rather, it may demonstrate that the Lib Dems are well respected across the nation.

This could have been a very good, strong argument, if it weren't for the fact that there is no justification for the statement. The Geography of Politics Further, my opponent seems to claim that the problem for the Lib Dems is their geography. However, the real problem is that they come second in a lot of constituencies. The Lib Dem party consistently come second, and there is consistently someone gets elected on a minority of votes. In Bromley and Chislehurst, Camborne and Redruth, Cambridge and Bournemouth East[1], the Lib Dems consistently come second. And this is something that happens in hundreds of consituencies. Probably the worst story is that of Lib Dem representative Julia Goldsworthy. In Camborne and Redruth, she gained15,903 votes, but came second to Conservative representative George Eustice, who gained 15,969 votes. This means that almost 16,000 voters for the Lib Dem party are not represented. Add in Labour's unrepresented 7,000 and UKIP's 2,100 and you have around 25,000 voters not being fairly represented, contrasting the 15,000 who are: a blatantly unrepresentative, undemocratic system. If STV was in place, a version of PR, then multi-member consituencies would come to exist, and drastically reduce the number of wasted votes in Parliamentary Voting and Constituencies Act 2011.[2] This could be used in conjunction with PR to make the seats balanced. However, the only way for a constituency border system to be so imbalanced as my opponent suggests is if the setting of the borders was intentionally unfair, and therefore both voting systems would be equally superficial. Further, PR would solve the problem of the Lib Dems coming second by giving them seats as per the number of votes they get, even if they come second, to let them be fairly represented. To allow the voter to be represented by someone they voted for. Finally, in regards to these hypotheticals about geography, borders are constantly adjusted to keep the population of a constituency roughly similar to other areas. For example, the borders of constituencies in Britain were changed last year to accomodate for any changes[5]. Moreover, the largest constituency is 110,000 (second largest 90,000) and the smallest 55,000[3], so the geographical advantage is a moot point. Only 9 out of the 650 constituencies are outside the range of 60,000 to 90,000 seats. However, in this situation, STV would still be better! As it is multi-constituency, each seat is worth the same number of votes. So in the third constituency, the seat shall only be worth two or three seats (if that), while the largest worth a hundred seats, meaning more representation to take into account that it is a larger constituency. Plurality systems would actually make it worse as it would mean that you're vote's value depends on your constituency. This is another problem with plurality votes, as you're geography seriously affects your vote's value. If you live in a place such as Witney, where over 60% of the votes consistently go to Conservative, also known as a 'safe' seat, then your vote has no value there: you cannot get your party or politician in to represent you. However, if you are in Camborne and Redruth, where the votes are really close, your vote is valuable beyond belief: your vote can actually affect who gets a seat in Parliament, and therefore how the country is run. This geographical discrimination disappears under STV, because each constituency holds seats dependant on the number of votes there are. This is known as Gerrymandering. These diagrams represent how gerrymandering works: the diagram on the left represents 4 ungerrymandered constituencies, each with 50% of the voters Red and 50% Blue. The one on the right represents 4 gerrymandered constituencies. This leads to the blue winning 3 seats, and red winning 1, so the blue voters win, even though they got the shared number of votes. in fact, there could be no blues in the bottom-left constituency, and blue would still win, while red would lose. This is incredibly easy in plurality, but in PR, which holds multiple MP constituencies, the reds would be represented fairer, making the system much fairer. This is a turn on the geographical aspect. So, to conclude on that point, the PR promotes democracy substantially more than plurality systems. Before moving to new arguments, I want to point out arguments conceded: STV allows the vote value of each seat to become more balanced, and the plurality system unfairly unbalances them. STV allows one to vote for a candidate inside one's party, and is therefore preferable in a Parliamentary system. STV allows other parties and ideas to access the political stage with more ease, and allows other parties to form. STV makes tactical voting unnecessary Plurality promotes political apathy and atrophy With this in mind, I await my opponent's rebuttal. 1 - <URL>... (UK_Parliament_constituency) <URL>...

For example, the borders of constituencies in Britain were changed last year to accomodate for any changes[5].   Moreover, the largest constituency is 110,000 (second largest 90,000) and the smallest 55,000[3], so the geographical advantage is a moot point. Only 9 out of the 650 constituencies are outside the range of 60,000 to 90,000 seats.   However, in this situation, STV would   still   be better! As it is multi-constituency, each seat is worth the same number of votes. So in the third constituency, the seat shall only be worth two or three seats (if that), while the largest worth a hundred seats, meaning more representation to take into account that it is a larger constituency. Plurality systems would actually make it worse as it would mean that you're vote's value depends on your constituency.   This is another problem with plurality votes, as you're geography seriously affects your vote's value.  If you live in a place such as Witney, where over 60% of the votes consistently go to Conservative, also known as a 'safe' seat, then your vote has no value there:  you cannot get your party or politician in to represent you.  However, if you are in Camborne and Redruth, where the votes are really close, your vote is valuable beyond belief:  your vote can actually affect who gets a seat in Parliament, and therefore how the country is run.  This geographical discrimination disappears under STV, because each constituency holds seats dependant on the number of votes there are.  This is known as Gerrymandering.  These diagrams represent how gerrymandering works:  the diagram on the left represents 4 ungerrymandered constituencies, each with 50% of the voters Red and 50% Blue.  The one on the right represents 4 gerrymandered constituencies.  This leads to the blue winning 3 seats, and red winning 1, so the blue voters win, even though they got the shared number of votes.  in fact, there could be no blues in the bottom-left constituency, and blue would still win, while red would lose.  This is incredibly easy in plurality, but in PR, which holds multiple MP constituencies, the reds would be represented fairer, making the system much fairer.  This is a   turn   on the geographical aspect.  So, to conclude on that point, the PR promotes democracy substantially more than plurality systems.  Before moving to new arguments, I want to point out arguments conceded:  STV allows the vote value of each seat to become more balanced, and the plurality system unfairly unbalances them.  STV allows one to vote for a candidate inside one's party, and is therefore preferable in a Parliamentary system.  STV allows other parties and ideas to access the political stage with more ease, and allows other parties to form.  STV makes tactical voting unnecessary  Plurality promotes political apathy   and   atrophy  With this in mind, I await my opponent's rebuttal.  1 -  http://en.wikipedia.org...

I will show how your views on gender inequality are outdated and unjustifiable. Not only is it wrong to deny women their full potential and autonomy, but it goes against our nation's core values of justice and equality. We must recognize that women are just as capable and deserving of respect as men, otherwise we risk perpetuating the very patriarchy we claim to abhor. Furthermore, many of us still hold Judeo-Christian beliefs which emphasize the fundamental unity of humanity, making it clear that there is no room for discriminatory practices like those used to oppress women throughout history. To quote the bible itself, \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Galatians 3:28) This country was founded on the principle of equality, so let\u2019s live up to our founders\u2019 vision and ensure that everyone, regardless of gender, is given the chance to reach their fullest potential.", "len_ideology": 1108, "content": "\nThe transformed argument follows the same structure but uses different language and provides evidence to support the claim.", "len_content": 124, "style": "\nThe above argument could also be presented visually using diagrams and charts instead of words.", "len_style": 96, "ideology-content": "\nThis version of the argument has been edited to remove unnecessary words and phrases while still conveying the same meaning.", "len_ideology-content": 125, "ideology-style": "\nThis version of the same argument has been edited to appeal to readers with a liberal political ideology by making use of different language and additional evidence. \nArgument: You should debate me.

Your belief that women are inherently less capable than men is both incorrect and dangerous. In addition, your claims of \u201cbiological differences\u201d between men and women don\u2019t hold up when examined closely; these so-called differences are often exaggerated and used to justify continued gender inequality. Furthermore, our Judeo-Christian roots as a Western civilization demand that we recognize the full humanity and equality of women. Additionally, recent surveys indicate that over 80 percent of Americans identify as Christians (1). What would the Bible say about unjustly denying women their basic rights? Galatians 3:28 clearly states, \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d The only valid justification for limiting women's rights is if there are genuine biological differences between men and women which prevent them from performing certain tasks equally\u2014which has yet to be proven. The Thirteenth Amendment was passed to end slavery precisely because it was wrong and unjust. Some Southern states then attempted to restore \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d by passing \u201cJim Crow laws,\u201d but the Fourteenth Amendment ultimately nullified those attempts.

{"basic": "\nArgument: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a planet as an object in our Solar System that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity and has cleared its neighborhood of smaller objects. Since Pluto does not meet either of these criteria, it cannot be considered a planet. Furthermore, if we were to reclassify Pluto as a planet, then we would need to do the same for other objects in the Kuiper belt, such as Eris and Makemake, which would make the number of known planets in our Solar System exponentially increase. This would create unnecessary confusion among scientists and students alike, who would no longer be able to accurately compare the sizes and distances between different planets within our Solar System. Therefore, Pluto should remain a dwarf planet rather than a full-fledged planet.", "len_basic": 826, "len_orig": 3248, "ideology": "\nArgument: First off I would like to note that my first statement was NOT an argument. So you can't call it \"weak without support\" when it wasn't an argument in the first place. Now without further ado, I will present my arguments for why Pluto should be a planet. \n1. Pluto has many characteristics of a planet Unlike small asteroids and comets, pluto has many planet characteristics. Pluto is far from a boring and dead ball of ice, for example, Pluto is large enough to be round. Nearly all asteroids and comets are irregularly shaped but Planets are large enough to have a gravity force strong enough to crush it into a spherical shape. Pluto's gravity is plenty strong to crush it into a sphere. Every other planet in the Solar System is a sphere due to their gravity.  \n2. Missing information from the Solar System By classifying pluto is \"not a planet,\" we are teaching people that there are only 8 planets. There are worlds past Neptune with Pluto being one of them. By saying pluto isn't a planet, it's like we are giving the image of a limited Solar System with only 8 planets. There are other worlds which we should not dis-include from the solar system.

(1) For one thing, he's using his own standard of beauty in order to determine the attractiveness of the examples he put in his argument, a standard that might not correspond to other people and henceforth, is inherently subjective. There are people who don't find Ann Coulter particularly attractive. I don't find Ann Coulter particularly attractive. There are people who have commented that she resembles a man to them. [1] I personally find Angelina Jolie very attractive, for example, but there are some who don't agree. However, my standard of beauty won't be entirely the same as another person's, and neither will theirs. The existence of a single person who doesn't find these women attractive shows that people's modes for attractiveness can vary, and the lack of a universal standard of attractiveness makes it impossible to objectively determine that any woman, Republican or otherwise, is beautiful to everyone. One could try to see how many standards of beauty a woman's attractiveness fits and estimate a majority, but my opponent neither looks up polls in order to see how many people find Republican women more attractive than Democrat or realizes that even a single disagreement that Republican women are more attractive proves there is no universal standard. Also a majority of people finding a particular subgroup of women attractive will not automatically change the minds of the people that don't find them attractive, so to say that these women are attractive in absolutes would be an inaccurate statement. (2) For another thing, he's also generalizing the idea that people will find all Republican women attractive and provides only a few examples in order to back up this claim.

(1) For one thing, he's using his own standard of beauty in order to determine the attractiveness of the examples he put in his argument, a standard that might not correspond to other people and henceforth, is inherently subjective. There are people who don't find Ann Coulter particularly attractive. I don't find Ann Coulter particularly attractive. There are people who have commented that she resembles a man to them. [1] I personally find Angelina Jolie very attractive, for example, but there are some who don't agree. However, my standard of beauty won't be entirely the same as another person's, and neither will theirs. The existence of a single person who doesn't find these women attractive shows that people's modes for attractiveness can vary, and the lack of a universal standard of attractiveness makes it impossible to objectively determine that any woman, Republican or otherwise, is beautiful to everyone. One could try to see how many standards of beauty a woman's attractiveness fits and estimate a majority, but my opponent neither looks up polls in order to see how many people find Republican women more attractive than Democrat or realizes that even a single disagreement that Republican women are more attractive proves there is no universal standard. Also a majority of people finding a particular subgroup of women attractive will not automatically change the minds of the people that don't find them attractive, so to say that these women are attractive in absolutes would be an inaccurate statement. (2) For another thing, he's also generalizing the idea that people will find all Republican women attractive and provides only a few examples in order to back up this claim.

So we cannot say that all nations should attack the attacker if they get attacked. Countries need to take in to consideration if they can win first. Going to war without first strategizing is fatal. So if countries followed this ideal then we would still be fighting each other impulsively like in the past. North Korea has \"Hit\" south Korea numerous times. But should the south hit the north back? The north could easily take the south. Witch is why they shouldn't hit them back. So following this resolution if we follow this resolution if a states followed this ideal then wars and extinctions that could have been avoided would be inevitable. If an ally hit us should we hit them back? No we need to talk to them and find out why first. Maybe it was an accident. If we just rush in and declare war I would have all been for nothing. 2. Domestic violence So if I being a man is hit by a woman should I then hit her back? Absolutely not. I should be the bigger person and walk away. I could bruise a woman much easier than she could bruise me. Neither parties shouldn't put their hand on each other especially if there in a relationship. If a couple truly loves each other , then neither should have the intention of inflicting harm to one another. Lets rewind time for this situation and say Hitler was gay and was dating a Jew.( just stay with me here) if Hitler hit the guy should that guy hit him back? absolutely not. He would have been gased or shot immediently. 3. Parental situations So, lets say you live in the ghetto and you stole 50 dollars of your moms money. At the time your 10 years old and 70 pounds. Mom on the other hand is about 160 and is a female bodybuilder. She hits you. Should you hit her back? You just stole her last bit of money to pay the light bill. Why should you hit her back? Are you justified in hitting her back even though you didnt consider the repercussions of your actions? Say were at grandmas and she hits you just because. Should you hit her back? As we know old people are fragile. Following this resolution then we should hit grandma. Though we didnt mean to you hitting her caused her to have a heart attack. because you follow the philosophy of this resolution, because you hit me that justifies that I should hit you back. absolutely not. Though in some cases if someone hits you, you are justified in defending yourself witch could include running, not in all cases should you hit the attacker back. In order for pro to solidly prove the success of this resolution He/she needs to prove that this resolution is justifiable in every situation and not just one situation.

{"basic": " * Round 2*\nPro opens with \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should take the Book of Mormon literally.\u201d This is irrelevant since our debate is over whether the BoM is historically accurate, not its literal accuracy. He then goes on to quote 2 Thessalonians 2:3, which states that the day of the Lord won\u2019t happen until certain conditions are met. However, these conditions refer to events at the very end of time, not to a possible future apostasy. Furthermore, even if there were such a possibility, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to the destruction of the Church. As Catholics believe, the Church can survive even great persecutions and crises, as evidenced throughout history. Finally, Pro argues that the Catholic Church is better than the LDS Church due to its longer existence and unbroken lineage to Saint Peter. While this is undoubtedly impressive, it still doesn\u2019t prove the Catholic Church to be correct. After all, the LDS Church is based on different principles and beliefs, making it impossible for them to be the same. Consequently, the burden of proof lies with Pro to show why the Catholic Church is superior to the LDS Church.\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_popes#Pope_Francis_.2F_Electors_of_the_Holy_Spirit_(since_April_2013)\n[2] https://www.lds.org/topics/who-is-a-prophet?lang=eng&query=%2B%22prophets+and+apostles%22\n[3] https://www.lds.org/leaders/leader-listings/presidents-of-the-church?lang=eng&query=%2B%22prophets+and+apostles%22", "len_basic": 1455, "len_orig": 4652, "ideology": " * @param {string} text Text to parse into arguments.\n     * @return {Array.<Argument>} Array of arguments parsed from the given text.\n     */\n    function parseArguments(text) {\n        var args = [];\n        \n        // Split the text into individual arguments\n        text.split('').forEach(function (char) {\n            if (!isWhitespace(char)) {\n                args.push({\n                    value: char,\n                    type: 'argument'\n                });\n            }\n        });\n        \n        return args;\n    }\n    \n    /**\n     * Check whether a character is whitespace.\n     * \n     * @param {char} ch Character to check.\n     * \n     * @return {boolean} True if the character is whitespace, false otherwise.\n     */\n    function isWhitespace(ch) {\n        switch (ch) {\n            case'':\n            case '\\n':\n            case '\\r':\n            case '\\t':\n                return true;\n            \n            default:\n                return false;\n        }\n    }\n})();", "len_ideology": 996, "content": " * @param {string} text Text to parse into arguments.\n     * @return {Array.<Argument>} Array of arguments parsed from given text.\n     */\n    function parseArguments(text) {\n        var args = [];\n        \n        // Split text into individual arguments\n        text.split('').forEach(function (char) {\n            if (!/[\\r\\n]+/.test(char)) {\n                args.push({\n                    value: char,\n                    type: 'literal'\n                });\n            } else {\n                // Handle multi-line arguments\n                var match = char.match(/^\"(.*)\"$/);\n                args.push({\n                    value: match[1],\n                    type: 'quoted'\n                });\n            }\n        });\n        \n        return args;\n    }\n});", "len_content": 767, "style": " * @param {string} url URL of the page to scrape\n     */\n    function Scraper(url){\n        // Initialize variables\n        var _html = '';\n        \n        // Load HTML content\n        $.get(url,function(data){\n            _html += data;\n        });\n        \n        // Parse HTML into DOM elements\n        $(_html).find('body').each(function(){\n           // Extract desired information from each element\n           console.log($(this));\n        });\n    }\n})();", "len_style": 463, "ideology-content": " * @param {string} text Text to parse into arguments.\n     * @return {Array.<Argument>} Array of arguments parsed from the given text.\n     */\n    function parseArguments(text) {\n        var args = [];\n        \n        // Split the text into individual arguments\n        text.split('').forEach(function (char) {\n            if (!isWhitespace(char)) {\n                args.push({\n                    value: char,\n                    type: 'argument'\n                });\n            }\n        });\n        \n        return args;\n    }\n    \n    /**\n     * Check whether a character is whitespace.\n     * \n     * @param {char} ch Character to check.\n     * \n     * @return {boolean} True if the character is whitespace, false otherwise.\n     */\n    function isWhitespace(ch) {\n        switch (ch) {\n            case'':\n            case '\\n':\n            case '\\r':\n            case '\\t':\n                return true;\n            \n            default:\n                return false;\n        }\n    }\n})();", "len_ideology-content": 996, "ideology-style": " * @param string $text Text to transform into an effective argument.\n     * @return string An effectively written argument based on the given text.", "len_ideology-style": 147, "all": " * @param string $text Text to transform into an effective argument.\n     * @return string An effectively argued version of the given text.", "len_all": 139, "text": "My opponent is basing almost the entirety of his argument off of pretty much one verse: 2 Thessalonians 2:3.

For starters, it never says every single person will be lost, just that there will be a revolt (or falling away). It never says the revolt will be universal, and as long as the revolt isn't universal, the Church will persist. It also fails to say that the Church would be restored, because it never says that the Church will be lost. Compare with this: \" And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. \" - Matthew 16:18 My opponent's claims would make Jesus a liar, as he says that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church. If the entire Church was wrecked to the degree that it would have to be reformed, the gates of Hell certainly prevailed. \" But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. \" - 1 Timothy 3:15 The Church is the pillar and ground of the truth. It does not seem likely that a pillar Jesus promised would not be destroyed would collapse. \" But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you.\" - John 16:13 In my opponent's view, either the Holy Spirit never came (in which case the Bible is completely wrong), or it came and bungled the job so badly that the Church collapsed anyway. If the Holy Spirit was present, it seems unlikely that it would teach all truth by letting every last person apostatize. Very counterproductive. \" To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus unto all generations, world without end. Amen.\" - Ephesians 3:21 The LDS Church has not existed for all generations. My opponent's theory, in a nutshell, was that Christ promised the Church would not be overcome, the Church was quickly overcome anyway, and Christ was like \"Oh, no biggie. I'll get around to fixing it soon. And by soon, I mean in 1800 years.\" Having disproven the possibility of total apostasy, it is trivial to demonstrate that the Catholic Church is preferrable. The Catholic Church is one of only two bodies with claim to valid Apostolic succession, and the Catholic Church can trace itself back to St. Peter, who was himself appointed by Christ. Here is a list [1], going all the way back to Peter. Pro writes \" I will be able to follow my priesthood line of succession through Jesus Christ himself.\", however he fails to show how this is the case in any way. Catholic priests can trace their succession through 2000 years back to Jesus; my opponent cannot say the same. Additionally, the LDS Church uses the 'Book of Mormon', in defiance of the Bible. \"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.\" - Galatians 1:8 Since I have some free space, I might as well address my opponent's opening statement. I find it humorous that my opponent writes \" I disagree with this because the idea that a random Italian group can say that this one man can speak to god is outrageous.\", because he's more aptly describing the LDS Church than the Catholic Church. The Pope doesn't have God's phone number, and is only protected from teaching doctrinal error, nothing more. On the other hand, the LDS Church believes it has a prophet [2]. Also, compare the LDS twelve apotles [3] to a sample of the Cardinals of the Catholic Church [4]. Note that the prophet is in defiance of 1 Corinthians 13:9-10, which says that prophecy will be done away with. \"(9) For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.

These fallacious points of reasoning in conjunction with the subsequent lack of warrant regarding Pro's theistic claims will show that there is no reason to accept the Pro case. Praxeological Analysis. The reason I think Pro made the mistake of thinking that I have to bring a rival moral theory in order to deconstruct his own is because he does not see a way for moral theories to be criticized in any other way. Pro seems to rely on the conception of morality as not criticisable by any rational means. This is not the case. Ethical goals need not be only criticized from the perspective of other ethical goals. Another non-moral standard on which to judge these goals and judgements is by praxeological critique. A praxeological critique refers to a value-free analysis of a moral assertion. Murray Rothbard explains: \"And yet praxeology may be extended beyond its current sphere, to criticize ethical goals. This does not mean that we abandon the value neutrality of praxeological science. It means merely that even ethical goals must be framed meaningfully and, therefore, that praxeology can criticize (1) existential errors made in the formulation of ethical propositions and (2) the possible existential meaninglessness and inner inconsistency of the goals themselves. If an ethical goal can be shown to be self-contradictory and conceptually impossible of fulfillment, then the goal is clearly an absurd one and should be abandoned by all. [...] we are not here attempting to establish a positive ethical system of our own or even to prove that such a system is attainable. We believe only that praxeology should have the right of veto, to discard any ethical propositions that fail to meet the test of conceptual possibility or internal consistency.\" [1] As Con to the resolution my purpose and goal within this debate is to show that whatever reasons Pro brings for the alleged immorality of homosexual acts is incorrect. This does not mean that I must supplant his moral theory with my own, that is unnecessary to show his theory to be faulty. I need only to show why Pro's own moral theory either rests on an existential error in its formulation or it is itself internally inconsistent. If this can be shown then there would be no reason to accept Pro's standard and this would be enough to oppose any such theory. This point also refutes Pro's assertion that to not argue from an absolute moral standard would be to give up objectivity in this debate. On the contrary, I can still show his own morality to be false via value-free reasoning. ===Deconstruction of Pro's Case=== The most serious problem with the Pro case is that Pro has completely failed to provide warrant as to the existence of the God. The relevance is that God is itself supposedly the entire grounding of moral normativity. Seeing as P1 implies the actual existence of such a God (I will assume for argument's sake that Pro did not base his ethical argument off the edicts of a fictional character for now), warrant is obviously necessary in order to corroborate his claim. If there's no valid reason to think that God exists then there is subsequently no valid reason to think that Pro's argument is sound. And since Pro has failed to provide an argument in favor of the existence of the Christian God AS WELL AS proof that God himself has made such an edict (even if God is shown to exist a separate line of reasoning is necessary to show that the Christian holy books were actually inspired by him), there is no valid reason to believe Pro's claim. ===Sources=== [1] Murray Rothbard.

The relevance is that God is itself supposedly the entire grounding of moral normativity. Seeing as P1 implies the actual existence of such a God (I will assume for argument's sake that Pro did not base his ethical argument off the edicts of a fictional character for now), warrant is obviously necessary in order to corroborate his claim. If there's no valid reason to think that God exists then there is subsequently no valid reason to think that Pro's argument is sound. And since Pro has failed to provide an argument in favor of the existence of the Christian God AS WELL AS proof that God himself has made such an edict (even if God is shown to exist a separate line of reasoning is necessary to show that the Christian holy books were actually inspired by him), there is no valid reason to believe Pro's claim.  ===Sources===  [1] Murray Rothbard.

With that brief introduction, lets get started. First and foremost, anything that exists only exists because of a cause. What do I mean? Something that exists only exists as the result of something else -- cause and effect. And the cause of somethings existence is always outside of itself, meaning, nothing has ever been demonstrably shown to have existed without a cause facilitating its existence. For instance, your birth was not the cause of your own doings. Rather, you exist because two people, along with the laws of nature, have allowed for your procreation. These are immutable laws of physics that have never been shown to be usurped. I naturally would defy PRO to prove otherwise in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I do not intend to use a logical fallacy, such as an argument of consensus, however, these theories reach beyond the theoretical stage for countless astrophysicists, mathematicians, and cosmologists. It therefore lends itself to more than mere credence and ends up being self-evident truths about life and the universe in which life itself is contained therein. Secondly, since time and space are essentially homologous, as in \"space-time,\" one cannot exist without the other. This seems fairly axiomatic without introducing lengthy theorems to prove it, because if something exists, when did it exist, and where did it exist? Obviously one cannot do without the other. For instance, when two events are separated by timed intervals, enough time passes between them for there to be a cause/effect relationship between the two events. For a particle traveling less than the speed of light, any two events which occur to or by the particle must be separated by these intervals -- hence, time, space, and matter being distinguishable from one another, however, they are not separate entities for they need each other in order to exist. Its that triune nature of physics that allow for life. Now, consider that there was no singularity, no point in which time began. Would time itself then become timeless? Surely not just on a philosophical level, because time outside of space means nothing, and indeed, could not exist in actuality-- never mind conceptually. Time, I think you would agree, are not merely contrivances of the human mind. Sure, humans have assigned intervals to time for our own benefit, but time in fact is a very real phenomenon regardless of how we divvy it up for our own convenience. Lastly, empirical evidence in the form of Hubble's redshift strongly imply that when the universe began, time itself began.

Con argues that condom use is unlikely to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Research states the opposite. Con makes the fundamental error that advocacy of condom use exists in a vacuum.

This is an important point to maintain. Con is arguing for the removal of a salient piece of technology that can reduce transmission risk. When programs are in place that deal with harm minimisation, the removal of any component can fundamentally undermine the entire structure and success of the program. Con needs to make the case of, in those areas where programs are run where harm minimisation includes education of safe sex practices, the drive for later onset of first time sexual intercourse and reduced polygamy - why the removal of condoms - a key factor in the reduction of the spread of disease and pregnancy - should be seen as valid. It makes no sense to remove a successful, unique portion of a program and expect the program to run with greater results. Studies in Thailand and China has shown that mass distribution of condoms along with education significantly reduced the incidences of HIV/AIDS. Similar programs in Africa and America have had positive results. [2][3][4][5] <URL>... Argument 3.

In the Caribbean where programs are less available the prevalence is high (around 2% of the general population - ranking the region 2nd in the world). It simply doesn't follow that population prevalence equals self monitoring abstinence in those populations. The second part is that condom usage will create cases of HIV/AIDS at a greater rate. In addition to what has been already listed, studies of discordant couples where proper condom use is maintained find transmission to the partner is extremely rare. [6] Argument 4. The amount of research against abstinence is large. A study of declining HIV prevalence in Uganda found no evidence that abstinence or monogamy had contributed to the decline. [4] In the U.S. the results are the same - abstinence education does not achieve its goals.

Firstly, women should have autonomy over their own bodies and decisions regarding pregnancy and reproduction must ultimately be made by individuals based upon their values, beliefs, and circumstances. Secondly, access to safe and legal abortions reduces the number of unsafe procedures performed in unsanitary conditions which often result in serious health complications such as infertility, sepsis, and even death. Thirdly, many countries around the world already restrict abortion in ways that create significant barriers for women seeking the procedure; further restrictions could push the practice underground resulting in increased risks associated with unsafe abortions.

His advocacy as stated in round 2 is as follows: \"I am specifically challenging the process of evolution used to explain the diversification of all life on planet earth.\" Ergo if I show that evolution diversifies life I win. I will touch on Darwin's finches first, \"My opponent mentions Darwin's finches; this is irrelevant as this is micro evolution.\" It is true that this is an example of micro evolution but that doesn't matter a) it is diversification thus proving that evolution promotes diversification and b) if you look to my definitions of micro and macro in round 4, it's easy to see that lots of small changes, micro evolutions, lead to a large change, a macro evolution. My opponent saying \"it's macro evolution\" is a cop out. He is avoiding an argument and you should vote him down just for this. Even if we ignore all my evidence and assert that the fossil. record is flawed and that the chicken-teeth thing is flawed it doesn't matter. I should still win because I have shown that evolution can diversify life. Moving on, \"I ask my opponent to show where I disagreed with the definition presented.\" My definition defines evolution by the process by which organisms diversify so here you can either a) accept that definition and you loose because you have accepted a definition which contradicts your advocacy or b) you disagree and thus you must provide a counter definition which you failed to do thus you loose here too. Next, \"Next it seems to me curious that dinosaurs were around millions of years ago they seem extremely complex and advanced.\" 11 million years is nothing on an evolutionary time scale. The earth is 4 billion years old. 11 million years is a blink of an eye on the evolutionary time frame. And if you look back past the dinosaurs, guess what you see? Organisms getting simpler. I also want to dispute his massivly baised source, Genesispark. Sure it is a source but everything here is baised. But regardless you have given no evidence, you have just copied and pasted quotes. If we are allowed to copy and paste quotes then that takes all the fun out of debate. But to make things fair allow me to copy and paste quotes. Regarding the \"gaps\" \"The evidence also shows that what have appeared to be gaps in the fossil record are due to incomplete data collection. The more that we learn about the evolution of specific species lines, the more that these so-called gaps or \"missing links in the chain of evolution\" are filled with transitional fossil specimens. One of the first of these gaps to be filled was between small bipedal dinosaurs and birds. Just two years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species, a 150-145 million year old fossil of Archaeopteryx was found in southern Germany. It had jaws with teeth and a long bony tail like dinosaurs, broad wings and feathers like birds, and skeletal features of both. This discovery verified the assumption that birds had reptilian ancestors\" ~~ <URL>... \"Since the discovery of Archaeopteryx, there have been many other crucial evolutionary gaps filled in the fossil record. Perhaps, the most important one, from our human perspective, was that between apes and our own species. Since the 1920's, there have been literally hundreds of well-dated intermediate fossils found in Africa that were transitional species leading from apes to humans over the last 6-7 million years. This evidence is presented in the last 3 tutorials of this series.\" ~~ <URL>... ^^These are specific things from the fossil record and here is more <URL>... This source outweighs his due to the fact that this is from the Anthropology Department at Palomar college and not some \"Creation Science\" website. Moving on, \"1st I find it quite perturbing and unscientific that the web site didn't bother posting any pictures, nor peer review.\" And Genesispark does? Genesis park is a biased site with not evidence. My site has specific evidence whereas yours has none. \" Next I question why the birds would have lost these teeth, as teeth are generally helpful not harmful\" Modern day birds have no need for teeth... Teeth are used to chew meat and modern day birds are not carnivorous. Overview: My opponent dropped Darwin's finches and I should win on that alone. Also my opponent has done none of his own work regarding, well, anything. He merely copied and pasted quotes from a biased, not peerreviewed, evidence lacking site.

I will touch on Darwin's finches first, \"My opponent mentions Darwin's finches; this is irrelevant as this is micro evolution.\"  \r\nIt is true that this is an example of micro evolution but that doesn't matter a) it is diversification thus proving that evolution promotes diversification and b) if you look to my definitions of micro and macro in round 4, it's easy to see that lots of small changes, micro evolutions, lead to a large change, a macro evolution. My opponent saying \"it's macro evolution\" is a cop out. He is avoiding an argument and you should vote him down just for this. Even if we ignore all my evidence and assert that the fossil. record is flawed and that the chicken-teeth thing is flawed it doesn't matter. I should still win because I have shown that evolution can diversify life.  \r\nMoving on, \"I ask my opponent to show where I disagreed with the definition presented.\"  \r\nMy definition defines evolution by the process by which organisms diversify so here you can either a) accept that definition and you loose because you have accepted a definition which contradicts your advocacy or b) you disagree and thus you must provide a counter definition which you failed to do thus you loose here too.  \n  \r\nNext, \"Next it seems to me curious that dinosaurs were around millions of years ago they seem extremely complex and advanced.\"  \r\n11 million years is nothing on an evolutionary time scale. The earth is 4 billion years old. 11 million years is a blink of an eye on the evolutionary time frame. And if you look back past the dinosaurs, guess what you see? Organisms getting simpler.  \n  \r\nI also want to dispute his massivly baised source, Genesispark. Sure it is a source but everything here is baised. But regardless you have given no evidence, you have just copied and pasted quotes. If we are allowed to copy and paste quotes then that takes all the fun out of debate. But to make things fair allow me to copy and paste quotes.  \n  \r\nRegarding the \"gaps\"  \r\n\"The evidence also shows that what have appeared to be gaps in the fossil record are due to incomplete data collection. The more that we learn about the evolution of specific species lines, the more that these so-called gaps or \"missing links in the chain of evolution\" are filled with transitional fossil specimens. One of the first of these gaps to be filled was between small bipedal dinosaurs and birds. Just two years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species, a 150-145 million year old fossil of Archaeopteryx was found in southern Germany. It had jaws with teeth and a long bony tail like dinosaurs, broad wings and feathers like birds, and skeletal features of both. This discovery verified the assumption that birds had reptilian ancestors\"  \r\n~~   http://anthro.palomar.edu...  \n  \r\n\"Since the discovery of Archaeopteryx, there have been many other crucial evolutionary gaps filled in the fossil record. Perhaps, the most important one, from our human perspective, was that between apes and our own species. Since the 1920's, there have been literally hundreds of well-dated intermediate fossils found in Africa that were transitional species leading from apes to humans over the last 6-7 million years. This evidence is presented in the last 3 tutorials of this series.\"  \r\n~~   http://anthro.palomar.edu...  \n  \r\n^^These are specific things from the fossil record and here is more   http://anthro.palomar.edu...  \n  \r\nThis source outweighs his due to the fact that this is from the Anthropology Department at Palomar college and not some \"Creation Science\" website.  \n  \r\nMoving on, \"1st I find it quite perturbing and unscientific that the web site didn't bother posting any pictures, nor peer review.\" And Genesispark does? Genesis park is a biased site with not evidence. My site has specific evidence whereas yours has none.  \n  \r\n\" Next I question why the birds would have lost these teeth, as teeth are generally helpful not harmful\"  \r\nModern day birds have no need for teeth... Teeth are used to chew meat and modern day birds are not carnivorous.  \n  \r\nOverview:  \r\nMy opponent dropped Darwin's finches and I should win on that alone. Also my opponent has done none of his own work regarding, well, anything. He merely copied and pasted quotes from a biased, not peerreviewed, evidence lacking site. Also, my opponent dropped the fruit fly argument by saying I have no source.

I shall point out that my opponent violated the structure of the debate. Round 2 is opening statements and round 3 was to begin rebuttals. I. Evidential Arguments A. Problem of Evil My opponent's attempt at refuting the problem of evil is a strawman. [1.1A] confusion of two kinds of beginning and causation My opponent's argument is a strawman. If you were to birth a child that will grow up to be someone like Adolf Hitler, you may have caused it, though you are not morally responsible. However, if you were able to prevent the murder, then you would be morally responsible for it. If God is able to prevent evil, but not willing, then he is malevolent. [1.2A] negation of evil in the grand scheme My opponent acknowledged the existence of pointless and horrendous evil. However, he states that it's nothing because it will all be eliminated in the next world. I say that it would not be redundant to prevent evil because it assumes that the ultimate end of evil is good. For example, imagine that a doctor amputates a patient's leg, an \"evil\", in order to prevent gangrene from spreading throughout the patient's body, \"the ultimate end\", which is \"good.\" Yet this example fails because the doctor is limited; unlike God who is unlimitted. A better example would be the same doctor having the same paitent having a cure for the gangrene without having to amputate it, decides do amputate it anyway. We would call such a doctor \"mad\", why should we then call \"God\" \"good\"? [1] B. The Argument from Demographics [2A] What incentive for Caring? My opponent is correct in regards that we are not referring to a specific deity. If God were all-loving, then he would have a desire to have a relationship with the whole of mankind. So, we come with this syllogism: Premise 1: If God were to exist, then he would desire a relationship with all of mankind. Premise 2: However, God does not have a relationship with the whole of mankind Conclusion: Therefore, it is probable that God does not exist. So, the incentive for caring is that God, if omnibenevolent, would desire a relationship with the whole of mankind. In order to have a relationship with the whole of mankind, he needs to have revealed himself in such a way to be able to have that relationship he desires. Sidebar note (this point is irrelavent as it is from a specific religion): This is exactly what Christianity teaches: God desires a relationship with mankind. [2] [2A] Incidental and Irrelavent See above. II. Evidential Arguments A. Incoherence of God [3.1A] Partial Incomprehensibility My opponent fails to understand the gist of the argument. He claims that there is no common concensus on the conception of God. My opponent is correct (and this can be used as another argument in favour of atheism, not going to go into detail here). This, however, does not address the argument. I defined God as a diety that has the specific attributes of the Judeo-Christian God. [3.2A] Omniscience does not include knowledge of future My opponent claims that God does not know the future. However, this goes against the definition of omniscience. Omniscience is the quality of having all knowledge [3]. Consequently, God knows all things possible and actual. In standard theology, God ordained whatever will come to pass according to his well (Eph. 1:11). Premise 1: If God knows everything, it follows that he knows the future (indeed, if you don't know the future, you don't know everything) Premise 2: God knows everything (by definition of omniscient); Conclusion: God knows the future. III. Refuting my opponent's arguments for God's Existence A. Modal Cosmological Argument I will respond to this argument in the next round due to time constraints and debate structure. B. Argument from Beauty I do not see how the fact that we can understand beauty means that there is a God. It simply does not follow.

I will assume your use of the word 'greater power' is an issue of semantics rather than an attempt to change the intention of the debate. Firstly, what is faith? As you have defined it, faith is belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. So you would claim that believing in God is faith because there is no empirical evidence for his existence. My claim isn't that Atheists believe in some all-powerful creator, but that they have to have faith to even start their world view. For example, let's take one of the most common arguments between Christians, a type of Theist, and Atheists: Origins of Everything: (What or who created the universe?) Christians say: God. Who created God? No one, he was always there. (We've arrived at an axiom that is consistent with the Munchhausen theory of axiomatic reasoning.) God was always there? But there's no tangible proof, there's no empirical evidence so it is a belief based in faith. Atheists say: \"The most commonly held view is that the universe was once a gravitational singularity, which expanded extremely rapidly from its hot and dense state.\" Where did the gravitational singularity come from? \"While this expansion is well-modeled by the Big Bang theory, the origins of the singularity remains one of the unsolved problems in physics.\" No proof for the origin of the gravitational singularity? No evidence for the causation of energy dispersion? Once again: a belief based in faith. (<URL>) So essentially, at its core, Christians have faith that a God exists, Muslims believe Allah exists and caused the creation of Earth, Atheists believe that gravitational singularity existed. Or some believe the universe always existed or there are other theories, but the one thing they all have in common is that something or some force or some material existed (Some theories even state that larger universes existed) but they cannot even hypothesize how. And even if they do hypothesize, there is no tangible proof or evidence suggesting how this is possible. God as an unexplainable force is a theory in the same way that 0+0= Universe is a theory. Both are based in faith in some greater truth. Both are based in the belief that something existed prior to matter or prior to the universe or that something has always existed (Which goes against natural law.) (Ie. Richard Dawkins presumes gravity.)

I will assume your use of the word 'greater power' is an issue of semantics rather than an attempt to change the intention of the debate.  \n     \n  Firstly, what is faith? As you have defined it, faith is belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. So you would claim that believing in God is faith because there is no empirical evidence for his existence. My claim isn't that Atheists believe in some all-powerful creator, but that they have to have faith to even start their world view.  \n  For example, let's take one of the most common arguments between Christians, a type of Theist, and Atheists:  \n  Origin of everything: (What or who created the universe?)  \n  Christians say: God. Who created God? No one, he was always there. (We've arrived at an axiom that is consistent with the Munchhausen theory of axiomatic reasoning.) God was always there? But there's no tangible proof, there's no empirical evidence so it is a belief based in faith.  \n  Atheists say: \"The most commonly held view is that the universe was once a   gravitational singularity  , which expanded extremely rapidly from its hot and dense state.\" Where did the gravitational singularity come from? \"While this expansion is well-modeled by the   Big Bang theory  , the origins of the singularity remains one of the   unsolved problems in physics  .\" No proof for the origin of the gravitational singularity? No evidence for the causation of energy dispersal? Once again: a belief based in faith. (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  )  \n  So essentially, at its core, Christians have faith that a God exists, Muslims believe Allah exists and caused the creation of Earth, Atheists believe that gravitational singularity existed. Or some believe the universe always existed or there are other theories, but the one thing they all have in common is that something or some force or some material existed (Some theories even state that larger universes existed) but they cannot even hypothesize how. And even if they do hypothesize, there is no tangible proof or evidence suggesting how this is possible. God as an unexplainable force is a theory in the same way that 0+0=Universe is a theory. Both are based in faith in some greater truth. Both are based in the belief that something existed prior to matter or prior to the universe or that something has always existed (Which goes against natural law.) (Ie. Richard Dawkins presupposes gravity.)  \n     \n  The Munchhausen Trilemma   \n  The second point I want to make is that, at the end of the day, we all revert to faith in reasoning. \"The Munchhausen Trilemma is a philosophical term coined to stress the purported impossibility to prove any   truth   even in the fields of logic and mathematics.\" (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  )  \n  (Here is the Trilemma as explained on wikipedia:)  \n  If we ask of any knowledge: \"How do I know that it's true?\", we may provide proof; yet that same question can be asked of the proof, and any subsequent proof. The M\u00fcnchhausen Trilemma is that we have only three options when providing proof in this situation:  \n  \n  The   circular argument  , in which theory and proof support each other (i.e. we repeat ourselves at some point)  \n  The   regressive argument  , in which each proof requires a further proof,   ad infinitum   (i.e. we just keep giving proofs, presumably forever)  \n  The   axiomatic   argument, which rests on accepted precepts (i.e. we reach some bedrock assumption or certainty)  \n  \n  The first two forms of argument were discounted by Greek Thinkers as weak. Let's address the strongest form: the third.  \n  So think of a child always asking 'why.' In the end people answer 'because I say so,' or 'that's just the way it is,' or \"it's life.\" Try that with any claim of truth. Just continue to ask the question 'why.' In the end you'll find that you   cannot   prove anything. All comes down to some presupposition or core belief. All comes down to a faith-based greater truth that has no logical proof nor reasonable explanation. It just is.  \n  These principles apply to Atheists and Christians. Buddhists and Muslims. They are principles of logic and common thought, not religion. So in the end, having faith isn't a spiritual conundrum. It is a human one.  \n     \n  Practical examples of other things Atheists have faith in:  \n  If God exists, you will see evidence of his existence. We do not see evidence of his existence, therefore he does not exist. (Presupposition is the first sentence.)  \n  Logic reveals truth. (Faith that there is 'truth' faith that logic is the right way to determine truth. Faith in truth and logic.)

To counteract this, we can look again to dictionary definitions of 'bad taste': \"Having or showing poor judgment or lack of good sense\" or \"behavior or style considered tacky or low class.\" We cannot deny that 'Titanic' has achieved immense commercial success, but we can question how meaningful that success really is when judging the artistic merit of the work. In order to make a successful blockbuster, studios often rely heavily on market research and focus groups to ensure maximum profitability. While this approach might lead to financial gain, it does not necessarily guarantee critical acclaim or artistic integrity. Furthermore, while the film may have started out as a serious drama, it quickly became clear that its main selling point was its ability to generate large amounts of money. As a result, the filmmakers resorted to including more action sequences and special effects in order to keep up viewer interest and maximize profits. By focusing too much on making sure the film appealed to the widest possible audience, the filmmakers neglected their duty to produce a thought-provoking piece of cinema.

This debate is about the mistake countries have made and continue to make by spending millions on condoms to send to African countries. Arguments I will begin by outlining my arguments. Once I see which parts my opponent contends, I will elaborate on those specific parts. \n  \nI would first argue that condom distributions do indeed help reduce the transmission rates of HIV/AIDS. While there may be some short term effects such as an increase in promiscuity due to the availability of condoms, overall the benefits far exceed the costs. Studies have shown that condom distributions lead to significant drops in both HIV and STD infection rates over time. For example, in Zimbabwe between 1998 and 2003, the government\u2019s introduction of free condoms led to a 76% drop in HIV infections among young adults. Furthermore, studies in South Africa showed that condom promotion campaigns had a positive impact on individuals\u2019 knowledge and attitudes towards safe sex practices. Ultimately, the evidence suggests that condom distributions are an effective way to combat the pandemic and save lives.", "len_basic": 1340, "len_orig": 2956, "ideology": "\nArgument: I would like to debate someone who is willing to put thought into this debate.

Once I see which parts my opponent contests, I will elaborate on those specific parts. \n  \nI would first argue that condom distributions do indeed help reduce the transmission rates of HIV/AIDS. While some may disagree, numerous studies have shown that providing access to condoms reduces the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS. For example, according to UNAIDS, \u201cIncreased availability of male condoms has resulted in significant declines in both HIV incidence and mortality.\u201d Additionally, the World Health Organization states that \u201ccondom promotion and distribution programs have contributed to substantial declines in HIV seroprevalence\u201d in many different regions around the world. Furthermore, research conducted in South Africa showed that \u201cthe introduction of free condoms was associated with a significant reduction in HIV prevalence among young adults\u201d. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that condom distributions do play an important role in helping reduce the transmission rates of HIV/AIDS. \n\nSecond, although condom distributions might lead to an overall decrease in HIV/AIDS transmission rates, it cannot be denied that such distributions come at a cost. Money spent on condom distributions takes away funding from other potentially more effective methods of combating HIV/AIDS, such as education initiatives or treatment programs. As stated by the WHO, \u201cThe costs of implementing comprehensive HIV prevention programmes, including condom promotion and distribution, are relatively low compared with the potential benefits.\u201d Therefore, it is clear that condom distributions are not the most efficient way to spend limited funds when alternative strategies exist. Ultimately, it seems that condom distributions are only justified if their cost is minimal relative to the potential benefit gained. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case in reality due to budgetary constraints. \n\nFinally, I would argue that condom distributions can cause more harm than good if not implemented properly. As mentioned earlier, condom distributions take away funding from other potentially more effective methods of fighting HIV/AIDS. Moreover, if condom distributions are not accompanied by adequate educational initiatives, then individuals may become complacent and overestimate the protection provided by condoms. This can ultimately lead to higher rates of HIV/AIDS transmission. To sum up, condom distributions can be beneficial but need to be carefully implemented and monitored to ensure maximum efficiency.", "len_ideology": 2942, "content": "\nArgument: I would like to debate someone who is willing to put thought into this debate.

Furthermore, many organizations such as UNFPA and USAID have reported that condom distributions have helped reduce the overall prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Therefore, I believe that condom distributions are an important part of helping reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. \n\nSecond, although condom distributions might lead to an initial drop in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, continued funding is necessary to ensure its sustained effects. As stated by WHO, \u201cThe long-term benefits of condom programming require sustained investment over time.\u201d Without continuous funding, the progress achieved via condom distributions will slowly dissipate as people become complacent or stop participating in them. Thus, governments need to commit to continuously funding condom distributions in order to keep HIV/AIDS rates low. \n\nFinally, I would argue that condom distributions are cost-effective. Yes, there is a financial cost associated with condom distributions but when compared to the potential costs of not doing so, it becomes clear that condom distributions are worthwhile. According to UNAIDS, \u201cFor every dollar invested in condom promotion and distribution, $6.87 in savings is realized.\u201d That is why, despite the upfront expense, condom distributions remain an essential component in fighting HIV/AIDS.", "len_ideology-content": 2414, "ideology-style": "\nArgument: I would like to debate someone who is willing to put thought into this debate.

The distribution of condoms harms women by taking away a major tool they have for protecting themselves against undesired sexual pressures. In African society, a man who impregnates a woman is considered responsible for protecting and supporting the child. This allows women to use this risk of responsibility as a defense.

They instinctively spot easy targets who are unguarded and alone[ <URL>... ] and may even use drugs to assist them in doing so[ <URL>... ]. The actual definition, and concept, of rape is that the victim is powerless and not consenting to it. Thus to assert that children are more vulnerable to pedophiles is to completely misunderstand what rape is. Rape is not 'roughing' another adult up, it is completely taking them and abusing them with 0% of their consent being involved in the process. Another common misconception is that pedophiles are more at large than rapists are. This is actually false in every single country around the world. I challenge my opponent to prove differently. If he demands proof, I shall give a few countries' statistics as proof in R3. Now I shall go on to combat some common contentions of Con in this debate. The first is the idea that children are less likely to report pedophiles than adults are to report rapes and so they need more encouragement. This is a completely unfounded statement and is not true in the least. Adult rape victims, in fact especially the more mature ones, feel that they must keep all their problems to themselves and deal with everything alone (unlike children who turn to their parents and friends for advice and guidance). Thus it is actually more likely to get out if it's a child. I shall now make two contention of my own and justify them: Contention 1: Rape leave a harsher psychological aftermath in the adults mind than nonviolent molestation does in the child's. Contention 2: The level of awareness that adults have in comparison to children means that much more of the experience will be remembered. Contention 3: The additional physical damage of rape makes it indefinitely more immoral than molestation.

{"basic": "1. Yes, I understand why you feel that way; however, my opponent\u2019s argument does not rely solely upon his/her personal opinion. He/She provided evidence from movies such as \u201cAvatar\u201d which demonstrate the potential of CGI technology when compared to traditional methods. Therefore, while it may be true that some viewers prefer the visuals of CGI, it cannot be denied that CGI offers greater possibilities than traditional methods.  \n    2. While I acknowledge that CGI technology can create impressive visuals, I still contend that nothing can compare to the emotional impact of physical props and sets. Even though CGI technology has advanced significantly, it still lacks the ability to elicit genuine emotion in the same way that a physical prop or set can. Furthermore, even if a CGI effect is visually stunning, it does not necessarily mean that it will be successful in terms of engaging the viewer. As such, I stand by my statement that CGI technology is not necessarily superior to traditional methods. \n    3. Although I admit that CGI technology requires considerable skills and dedication to produce quality results, I disagree that it requires more time than traditional methods. Traditional methods often involve multiple stages of production where each stage must be completed before moving onto the next. Conversely, CGI technology allows for much more flexibility and creativity since changes can easily be made during post-production. Thus, although CGI might take longer to develop due to its complexity, it ultimately saves time when compared to traditional methods. \n    4. Finally, I completely agree with this statement.

Again this argument is based on personal preference but judging by how well Avatar did, it's safe to say that CGI can excite people more than NCBT.\" \n  \nI agree that this argument is based on personal opinion. My opinion is that whilst CGI can certainly be used to represent destruction on a vast scale, it doesn't make that destruction any less \"fake\". Take for example the star fighter models used in the original Star Wars trilogy v.s. the CGI star fighters used in the prequels. In the original, you had dozens of scale models being blown up in real fiery explosions. The use of models and pyrotechnics created a realistic depiction of an otherwise fantastical situation: an epic battle in space. In the prequels, all people were seeing ware animations of ships and explosions, rather than real explosions, so that an impossible situation remained impossible, because rather than trying to make a fantastical situation seem real, the CGI just reinforced the fact that it wasn't real. \n  \n\"2.

An effect that is used to represent the entire film ceases to become special. Though I do agree that Pixar are the gods of CGI! On CGI v.s. practical effects characters in films with good character development and plotting, a practical effects character will always come out excellent.

Furthermore, research shows that moderate use of social media websites can help boost mental health and wellbeing.

Moving on; Now, it is my understanding that your two main points stemming from your opening argument are these: (1) Online Social Networks are waste of time for everyone except for advertisers -and- (2) Users can be exploited because of what information they post onto the site. To begin, I will answer your first argument, by highlighting three types of users that make accounts on social networks (SNW) 1: The casual user 2: The specialist 3: The hardcore user (1) Casual User: These are the ones that create accounts maybe because it's the cool thing to do, or just to keep up on the goings on in there life with friends/family/etc. They typically check there account every few days, answering messages/friend requests/wall posts, things of that nature. The benefits of the SNW for these users are small, but they justify actually having accounts. On most SNWs, one is able to create an event, and invite friends to it. This is one plus from social networking, the ability to plan things online, and talk to people that you may not normally talk to. Also, it can be used as a beefed-up email, if one misses an assignment, they can message a peer to get the notes. Moving on: (2) Specialist: These are the ones that make accounts, because of something they do. Myspace has gotten a lot of credibility for Myspace Music, a subsidy of the large site. A lot of current musicians have Myspace accounts that people can go to, to listen to music. Myspace Music has helped propel many artists. One such is Josephine Collective, a band out of Johnson County Kansas. They're one of the biggest things in Kansas right now, and have a very large cult following. Because of their Myspace page, a Warner Music representative offered them a contract, and they will have a major label release in the summer. Also, there have been specialized sites that musician's can sign onto, such as Purevolume, or Imeem. Because of the mass amount of SNWs out there that support music, a lot of indie bands have gained popularity, such as Vampire Weekend and the Black Keys. Specialized SWNs aren't just limited to music, though. While major ones such as Facebook allow groups to be made, so say, a runner can find running partners, there are smaller, more intimate sites, that allow everyone to know each other. There are sites for certain sports, or for people who like to write. Now onto number three. (3) Hardcore Users: These are the ones that basically live online. Now, whether or not people in the \"real world\" think this is right or not, the user still does it. It might seem like a bad habit, but in actuality, aside from the chance of becoming overweight, it really isn't. There are plenty of people in the world like this, the ones shunned by their peers, the ones that no one in \"real life\" likes. But, they thrive online, by talking to people just like them. Perhaps they just have an interest in something that no one in their town does. That's what's beautiful about the internet, is that you can find another person that shares the same interests as you. To tell people like this that SWNs waste their time, is just overzealous, because you're not the one living their life. Perhaps it's your goal to do things off the internet, but here are just three prime examples of people that, while they may be on SWNs a lot, don't waste their time. It's there choice, not yours. Now, onto my second argument: Although there have been instances where people have been scammed, or kidnapped, because of what they post online, this really isn't the majority. When you have millions of people signed onto these thing, having a few thousand get hurt isn't significant. Not to mention the fact that the sites clearly state about the threats of putting information out into the public. Also, there are privacy settings that a user could implement, and it comes down to good judgment and common sense. This isn't just limited to SWNs, it is a bad thing that injustices happen, but they'll happen on any level of the internet, if the person is ignorant enough to fall into a trap. It can happen to Myspace users, it can happen to blog users. The internet isn't safe, but, it's not dangerous either, if you have common sense. In conclusion, it's pretty selfish to have your viewpoint, because everyone makes accounts for different reasons.

They haven't contributed anything to society and probably never will if they were going to be aborted. Many aborted babies are retards or downies and therefore would be a burden on society. Other aborted babies would have had whores or crackheads as mothers and no fathers present so they would've become absolute trash and they would have had to resort to crime. If one or two feminists throwing feces at police is feminism then I suppose one or two anti-feminists being homosexuals means homosexuality is anti-feminism. Every woman should support feminism.

They get paid less because they can't come to work and because they will need time to take care of the child. Only 10% of men get kidney stones and that is not something you can compare to a baby. You don't have to live with your kidney stones for 9 months, you don't get paid less because of them, you just don't show up to work when you have them.

Throughout history peoples have sought to impose their religion on other, claiming their beliefs to be superior to others. It is my argument that the idea of one religion being logically superior to another is fallacious. Thus no religious belief is anymore valid than any other. First of all, to clarify, I am not an Atheist. I am agnostic. I do not deny there is a god, nor do I believe there is one. I find Atheism to be hypocritical because Atheists accuse theists of having no proof, but they also cannot DISPROVE the existence of God. Rather I believe that humans cannot possibly ever know if there is a god or not and as such should not devote our live to worship of one. --- In order for a religion to be superior to another their must be some logical reason to prefer it to over others. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote \"There cannot be a God because if there were one, I could not believe that I was not He.\" While this claim seems narcissistic if we look at what Nietzsche means, we come to our logical flaw. If we can assign some super characteristic to an unknown entity what possible reason is there to exclude the possibility of infinite gods? it is impossible to find ONE reason why any belief in god is either more or less correct than any other belief. finding such a reason is impossible because someone will always have a counter claim to any religious puzzle that they will believe is most valid. Religion cannot be warranted without appeal to itself. It is a classical example of circular reasoning. In order for the conclusion to be true the premise must be true and in order for the premise to be true the conclusion must also be true. Thus the logical basis for religion requires fallacy. In order for a religion to be superior, tenants of that religion must be true as well. For example if religion A says there is an afterlife and religion B says we just go away, it could be argued that A is superior because of an afterlife. However this automatically presumes A to be right in the first place. But A has no more claims to validity than B or C so thus we cannot presume that religion A is superior. Religious belief is always going to require a leap of faith. And because such a leap of faith is dependent upon the individual making it, there is absolutely no way for any religion to be logically superior unless we either make another leap of faith or logical fallacy.

I'd like to address my opponent's contentions: 1. They could save an animal from being endangered. The concept of \"endangered animals\" isn't restricted to just one individual of a species. Instead, it is the entire species that is endangered, usually directly or indirectly by humans. That being said, a zoo is, no matter how hard we try to make it, not an animal's nature habitat. Preserving a species in captivity is not really preserving them at all. It is artificial. These animals come to rely too much on their caretakers, and when released into the wild have hard times trying to adapt to the natural order. 2. Zoos provide medical care for animals. Only for the animals they keep. The whole reason these zoos have medical care is not out of what is morally right, but for their audience. The more animals, especially exotic ones, that are sick, the less of them people see, and thus the less people who visit the zoo and pay for tickets and concessions. Zoos are ultimately, for profit. Now, I'd like to provide my own contention: 1. Exotic animals should not be captured from the wild, transported to foreign countries, and put on display. Separating animals from their environment is inherently bad for their quality of life, even if they are provided medical care and adequate nutrition. Many have problems adapting to the new environs of the climates they have been transported, unwillingly, to. They easily become sick, and can be exposed to other animals who are not native to their own native habitats.

My opinion is that your parents stole your childhood, and as a product of there selfishness and irresponsibility you had to grow up faster than most ids, and that isn't fair to you at all...Having a child at the age of 17 is so young, you cant experience anything life has to give and offer, you cant pursue any dreams...you have to be there for your son double now because he doesn't have a mother now, and that's not fair to him either...As to your statement on pushing kids as hard as you can depending on age...That to me is just horrible, why would you want to do that to your child, you should just want your child to be happy and grow up being a kid...just enjoy and encourage your child as they grow and learn...They grow up very quick, and if you push them at a young age, then your gonna miss all the joys they can show you...A kid should be a kid...To me it sounds like your going to push your son out of childhood quickly just as your parents did to yourself, because you have a fear of your child going thru the same thing you did. So intern your pushing him into adulthood to make him a strong person, so he will be able to face this unfair world...I'm sorry, but that to me sounds like a product of your environment, only because you stated you had to adapt to any environment your mother put you in...You shouldn't have had to grow up without a father, you shouldn't have had to grow u with a mother that wasn't there, food on the table and a roof over your head isn't enough, we are human beings, and we need love, a child needs to be loved...we aren't animals....", "category": "Society", "round": 5, "debate_id": "Sex-before-marriage/3/", "idx": 49678}

{"basic": "\nI thank my opponent for taking the time to craft such a well thought out rebuttal. Before addressing his arguments, however, let me make two clarifications. Firstly, while my opponent has argued that the US\u2019 current policy of prohibiting the purchase of alcohol until the age of twenty-one is analogous to America\u2019s \u201csecond experiment\u201d with Prohibition, I believe that this comparison is flawed due to the vast differences between the two policies. While both involve restricting access to certain individuals based upon their age, the primary difference lies in the severity of the restriction; whereas Prohibition completely banned the production, distribution, and sale of alcohol, the current policy merely delays its availability until the age of twenty-one. Secondly, although my opponent claims that allowing eighteen-year-olds to buy alcohol would lead to an increase in binge drinking among young adults, I contend that the evidence presented thus far suggests otherwise. For example, numerous studies have found that the majority of eighteen-to-twenty-zero year olds choose not to consume alcohol, regardless of its legality (see sources cited). Therefore, even if alcohol were made available to those aged eighteen and older, it seems unlikely that binge drinking rates would significantly rise. With these points in mind, I shall now proceed to refute each of my opponent\u2019s main arguments.  \n\nMy opponent begins by claiming that lowering the minimum legal drinking age would result in fewer drunk driving fatalities since younger drivers would be less likely to drive after consuming alcohol. However, this argument fails to take into account the potential consequences associated with delaying the legal drinking age. As previously mentioned, research shows that the majority of eighteen-to-twenty-year-old non-drinkers would remain abstinent even if allowed to imbibe legally. Thus, the only group that could potentially benefit from lowering the drinking age would be those who currently engage in risky behaviors related to alcohol, such as binge drinking. Unfortunately, this same demographic is also more likely to be involved in other high risk activities, such as speeding and driving under the influence of drugs. In short, there is simply too great a risk that these individuals will continue to put themselves and others in danger by operating vehicles while impaired. Additionally, my opponent neglects to mention that the current legal drinking age of twenty-one is intended to give young adults additional time to mature before being exposed to the physical and psychological dangers of heavy alcohol use. By lowering the minimum legal drinking age, we would essentially be undermining this very important goal. Finally, my opponent attempts to counter my argument regarding police resources by pointing out that underage drinking is already prevalent in society. However, this response ignores the fact that the police still have limited resources and must prioritize their efforts accordingly. Even if underage drinking were to become more widespread, it does not necessarily follow that law enforcement agencies would be able to dedicate the necessary personnel and funds to investigate all instances of illegal alcohol consumption. Ultimately, then, the potential benefits of lowering the minimum legal drinking age appear to be outweighed by the possible risks.", "len_basic": 3393, "len_orig": 2842, "ideology": "\n### Closing Statements\n    As discussed throughout our debate, lowering the minimum legal drinking age from 21 years old to 18 years old could potentially reduce drunk driving fatalities among young adults while still providing minors with access to responsible alcohol use education. Ultimately, the decision to make such a change lies within each individual state\u2019s legislature; however, until then, states should consider implementing stricter regulations regarding the purchase and possession of alcohol by those below the legal drinking age.", "len_ideology": 547, "content": "\nI thank my opponent for taking the time to craft such a well thought out rebuttal. Before addressing his arguments, let me start off by saying that while I appreciate the effort put forth in creating this argument, I believe that the burden of proof lies with my opponent since he made the initial claim. He argued that lowering the drinking age would lead to fewer deaths due to drunk driving, yet provided no evidence to back up his assertion. Therefore, until he provides evidence to support his position, I don\u2019t think the burden of proof has been met. With that said, let us examine his arguments. Firstly, my opponent claims that lowering the drinking age would promote \u201ctolerance and moderation\u201d. While this may be true, it still does not necessarily mean that it would reduce the number of deaths caused by drunk drivers. Secondly, my opponent states that making alcohol legal at 18 would make it easier to police. However, this assumes that those who are 18 years old and older would obey the law and refrain from consuming alcohol. Finally, my opponent brings up the example of the UK where the legal drinking age is 16; however, this fails to take into account the cultural differences between the US and the UK. In the UK, alcohol is often consumed earlier in life and thus, may explain why the legal drinking age is lower. Overall, without any evidence presented to support his argument, I don\u2019t think my opponent has successfully proven that lowering the drinking age would reduce the number of deaths caused by drunk driving.", "len_content": 1541, "style": "\nI thank my opponent for taking the time to craft such a well thought out rebuttal. Before addressing any specific points, however, I\u2019d like to make two general observations. Firstly, while my opponent has made numerous valid arguments, none of these directly refute my main contention that allowing 18-year-olds to legally consume alcohol could lead to dangerous consequences. Secondly, although my opponent has attempted to frame his argument within the context of current UK policy, this fails to account for the vast cultural differences between the US and the UK; thus, the effectiveness of current UK policies cannot necessarily be extrapolated onto those proposed here. With regards to my opponent\u2019s specific points, I shall respond as follows:  \n\nMy opponent claims that \u201clowering the drinking age to 18 or below\u201d would promote \u201ctolerance and moderation\u201d. While this may be true in certain instances, it neglects to acknowledge the potential risks associated with providing access to alcohol at such a young age. As previously mentioned, adolescence is a period of significant brain development, meaning that teenagers are particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of alcohol use. Furthermore, studies have found that early exposure to alcohol is correlated with an increased likelihood of developing an alcohol addiction later in life. Thus, while moderate usage among 18-year-olds might be possible, there is simply too great a risk that it won\u2019t be the case. \n\nFurthermore, my opponent suggests that \u201cmodern society needs to learn how to handle responsibly its freedom.\u201d However, this ignores the fact that modern societies around the world have been handling responsible drinking for centuries \u2013 why suddenly introduce a change now? Additionally, even if we accept that 18-year-olds possess the maturity required to handle alcohol responsibly, there remains the question of whether or not they should be exposed to such temptations in the first place. After all, the decision to drink or not should ultimately be a personal one, not one influenced by external pressures. \n\nFinally, my opponent attempts to draw a comparison between the drinking ages in the UK and the US. Unfortunately, this analogy falls apart due to the distinctive culture and history of each nation. For example, the UK\u2019s \u2018pub culture\u2019 serves as a major influence on attitudes towards alcohol, whereas such a culture does not exist in the same way in the US. Moreover, the UK\u2019s mandatory military service requires men aged 18 to serve for two years, giving them greater experience with alcohol at a younger age. Again, this contrasts sharply with American culture, where military service is voluntary and typically begins at the age of 18.

Here\u2019s why: 1) Hoover is accountable for the most severe parts of the Great Depression.

Not to mention the countless number of poor & destitute who perished from starvation. 2) What did Hoover achieve? Yes, he helmed the biggest boom in US history, yet failed to take any action while the nation crumbled around him. His stubbornness & allegiance to the wealthy & bankers caused much more damage than needed. 3) Hoover\u2019s inertia allowed for a precipitous decline in global standards of living.

Sure, he oversaw the greatest boom in American history, but also sat by and watched as the country tore itself apart.

{"basic": "\nAnswer: \nMy opponent has failed to effectively counter my argument that Islamic terrorism is caused primarily by a distorted view of jihad and the teachings of the Qur\u2019an and hadith. My opponent claims that Christian suicide bombings are rare because \u201cin non-Islamic countries you also have people in bad mental states\u201d; however, this does nothing to explain away the fact that Islamic terrorism is uniquely rooted in religious doctrine. Furthermore, my opponent neglects to mention that even in predominantly Muslim countries, there are areas which are more open to other religions (e.g. Indonesia). Additionally, my opponent fails to acknowledge the cultural factors which contribute to religious extremism; indeed, it is often the case that certain segments within society actively encourage radicalization due to their own political agendas. Finally, my opponent provides no evidence to support his claim that there are fewer churches/temples in majority-Muslim countries compared to non-Muslim ones \u2013 in fact, according to a Pew Research Center survey, the opposite is true. Therefore, it appears that my opponent\u2019s assertion is incorrect.", "len_basic": 1145, "len_orig": 1770, "ideology": "\nArgument 2: Islamophobia has become increasingly prevalent in some parts of the world today. In order to combat this, we must first understand its root cause - fear of the unknown. Many people lack knowledge and understanding of Muslim cultures due to limited exposure.

Additionally, it\u2019s important to recognize that Islamophobia often stems from racist attitudes towards people of color. We need to challenge discriminatory practices and policies which target marginalized groups, including Muslims. Ultimately, if we want to create lasting change, we must start by embracing diversity and promoting inclusion.", "len_ideology": 709, "content": "\nAnswer: \nMy opponent has presented some valid points regarding the lack of churches/temples in Islamic countries compared to other countries with different religions. One possible reason for this is due to the fact that Muslims make up the majority of the population in those countries, thus making it unnecessary to build additional places of worship. Additionally, the climate may play a role; certain regions tend to be more hospitable towards religious structures such as churches and temples, whereas others may not offer the same comforts. Furthermore, economic factors may come into play, as building new religious buildings requires financial resources which some countries might not possess. Ultimately, the answer lies within each individual country\u2019s unique circumstances.", "len_content": 784, "style": "\nArgument 2: Islamophobia has become increasingly common in some parts of the world today.

By educating ourselves on the fundamentals of Islam and engaging with our Muslim neighbors, we can work towards creating a society free from discrimination and intolerance.", "len_style": 523, "ideology-content": "\nArgument 2: I would like to thank my opponent for his/her insightful comments. My opponents first statement was that terrorism is caused by a mentally unstable mindset which is incorrect because even in predominantly Christian countries such as the United States, we see cases of domestic terrorism. For example, Timothy McVeigh who carried out the Oklahoma City bombings in 1995 was a devout Catholic. Furthermore, my opponent mentioned that there are no churches or temples in most Islamic countries; however, this can be attributed to the fact that Muslims make up the majority of the population in those countries therefore there is no need for them. In contrast, in non-Islamic countries there is a large variety of religions thus creating a demand for places of worship. Additionally, my opponent failed to acknowledge the role of the Vatican in preventing interfaith conflict. The Vatican has played an active role in promoting peace between different faiths through organizations such as the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. To conclude, terrorism is fueled by multiple factors including religious extremism, economic inequality, and social marginalization. Therefore, it is wrong to attribute terrorism solely to a \u201cmentally unstable\u201d mindset.", "len_ideology-content": 1268, "ideology-style": "\nArgument 2: I would like to start out by saying that I appreciate my opponents argument and respect his opinion. That being said, I believe that his argument does not fully consider some important factors when discussing the root cause of terrorism. My first point is that terrorist organizations often use religion as justification for their actions; however, it is important to note that terrorism is not exclusive to Islam. Groups such as the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, Tamil Tigers, and Shining Path are examples of non-Islamic terrorist groups who have committed acts of violence in pursuit of their goals. Additionally, even within Islam there are different schools of thought which can influence how individuals interpret and apply religious teachings. For example, Sunni and Shiite Muslims differ in their beliefs regarding certain aspects of Islam, including jihad. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that all terrorist activities are motivated solely by Islamic doctrine.  \nMy second point addresses the issue of access to sacred sites. While it is true that non-Muslims are generally unable to enter the inner chambers of the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Medina, this restriction is due to cultural and religious sensitivities, rather than any sort of discrimination against other faiths. In contrast, the Vatican is open to visitors of all religions, allowing them to freely enter and explore the site without fear of persecution. Furthermore, Christianity has no equivalent to the Kaaba, meaning that non-Christians are unable to visit the holiest sites of Christendom. Thus, the Vatican is actually less restrictive towards those of other faiths than Mecca and Medina.  Finally, I would like to address my opponent\u2019s statement that \u201cthese two cities [Mecca and Medina] are very holy.\u201d While it is certainly true that these locations are highly significant to Muslims, they are equally significant to Christians and Jews, who also view them as places of great spiritual importance. To conclude, although terrorism is undoubtedly a complex phenomenon caused by a combination of social, economic, and psychological factors, it is incorrect to attribute all instances of terrorism to Islam alone.", "len_ideology-style": 2217, "all": "\nArgument 2: I would like to start out by saying that I appreciate my opponents argument and respect his opinion. That being said, I believe that my opponent has failed to recognize some key points regarding Islamic extremist groups such as ISIS. Firstly, it is important to note that although there may not be any Christian suicide bombings, other types of religious violence do exist. For example, the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army is a militant group founded by a self-proclaimed prophet which has committed numerous atrocities in central Africa over the past decades. Similarly, the Tamil Tigers were a violent separatist organization in Sri Lanka who sought to create an independent homeland for the Tamil people. Both of these organizations had a strong spiritual component to their beliefs and actions. Additionally, your statement that \u201cIslamic terrorists\u201d (which is a term I reject) don\u2019t blow themselves up in hopes of attaining physical pleasures in Paradise is incorrect; several prominent Islamic extremist groups including Al-Qaeda and ISIS cite the promise of virgins in Paradise as motivation for martyrdom operations. Furthermore, even if we limit our discussion to Sunni Islam, there are plenty of examples of Muslims committing acts of terror in the name of religion. Just last year, a man plowed his truck into a crowd of pedestrians in Toronto killing ten people and injuring fifteen others. The attacker claimed that he did it in response to recent events like the Syrian Civil War and the Quebec City Mosque Shooting. Clearly, religion can be used as justification for extreme violence and terrorism.  \n\nIn conclusion, while there may not be as many churches or temples in predominantly Muslim countries compared to non-Muslim ones, this does not mean that religion is any less influential in inspiring radicalization and terrorism.", "len_all": 1848, "text": "I thank my opponent for an interesting debate. These arguments have been nearly impossible to refute so I will try my best. First off, my opponent mentions that terrorism is a result of a bad mental state. However, in non-islamic countries you also have people in bad mental states and I don't think I have ever heard of a christian suicide bomber. While I am aware there are non-islamic terrorists(Lord's Resistance Army, Tamil Tigers, and Shining Path to name a few. <URL>... ) they don't blow themselves up in hope of obtaining physical pleasure in paradise. It could possibly be more than mental illness that causes these people to blow themselves up. Even in the poorest non-islamic countries in Africa terrorists don't blow themselves up. Why is this exclusively an islamic thing? The Qur'an or Hadith perhaps? Secondly, I will like to address my opponent's point about the Vatican. It is true that most people can't enter the inner offices of the Vatican. However, non-christians can still enter the Vatican. Non-muslims cannot enter Mecca or Medina at all so the Vatican is still more tolerant. He states that these two cities in Saudi Arabia are very holy, but so is the Pope to Catholics since he is their main figurehead. Thirdly, my opponent fails to provide a proper explanation as to why there's very few churches or temples in most islamic countries while there being many mosques in non-islamic countries. I do realize that this could be a result of demographics. Most islamic countries are almost entirely muslim while many non-islamic countries are a mix. This leads to another interesting factor though. Could that be a result of non-muslims not feeling comfortable living in islamic countries?

War and National Emergencies I am glad to here that the balanced budget is allowed to be broken in case of military or other massive national emergencies. However, this ignores times when a high a military budget is needed that even exceeds the total federal revenue. Ronald Reagan knew how to defeat the Soviet Union and the only way possible to compete with the Soviets in the military to raise spending, train the troops, build the fleet, and create SDI. The good news is that we now have no Soviet Union, but in the case of a future second cold war as well as the protection in our era of global terrorism, we need a military build-up. I always put the welfare of the American people first, but we also need to make sure they're protected. So even sometimes when we are not in military conflict, we might need a high military just in case. [1] I do feel that my opponent did not properly address national emergencies. When a hurricane hits, a tornado strikes, or a snow storm falls then the government should send assistance to help the innocent creatures stuck in this emergency. This means we need to spend money even if it does mean going into debt for the benefit of helping the American people. II. Recessions What we see from this graph ( <URL>... ) is the sudden drops in recessions. When a budget is balanced and a recession comes, revenue has historically dropped. We see this is many cases: the 1920 recession, 1981 recession, 2000 recession, and the 2008 recession. However, the most notable in my opinion is the 1948 recession where we saw a massive drop in revenue that has not been seen since. We are not just discussing if FDR's New Deal was right or wrong. I argued that traditionally the poor needed to be relieved in some way when in recession. FDR tried a New Deal and this led to more debt, Obama tried a stimulus and this led to new debt, Reagan passed a massive tax cut and this led to new debt (along with keeping the Soviets at bay), and Harding passed a massive tax cut and this dropped revenue until Coolidge could get it together. Whenever an action is issued in a recession, there is a cost. In this case, the cost is revenue which could lead to the rise of debt. III. Congress Breaks the Constitution I am not arguing that breaking the Constitution is wrong, but I am arguing if this amendment will be efficient.

This idea that \"God sends us here to be tested in our faith in Him\" could very well be true; He may have created us as spiritual beings and has given us free choice to choose either good or bad. Regardless, whatever purpose there is in life, God can always make it happen. Whether or not we reach Heaven depends on how we use the gift of free choice. The parental analogy is still valid even if parents aren't necessarily omniscient. They can provide guidance while allowing their children to learn from their experiences. Similarly, God can give us knowledge without making us go through the trials and tribulations of life.

The parental analogy is flawed because parents don\u2019t have the same level of control over their children as God does over us.

In regards to my opponents argument regarding me changing the scope of the debate, while I understand their frustration, I believe that my opponent misunderstands the nature of our debate. We both agreed beforehand that the topic of the debate was \u201cShould DHMO Be Banned?\u201d; however, during the course of the debate, I provided evidence that showed that certain types of DHMO should indeed be banned. As such, I am merely providing further clarification as to which types of DHMO should be banned. Furthermore, my opponent\u2019s argument that I am somehow being inconsistent because I did not explicitly state which types of DHMO should be banned in my initial argument is flawed. While it may be true that I should have specified which types of DHMO should be banned, it is equally valid to argue that my opponent should have specified which types of DHMO should remain legal when making their initial argument. Ultimately, neither side specified which types of DHMO should be banned or kept legal, yet my opponent is adamant that I must stick to the exact same rules that they themselves chose to break. Additionally, my opponent\u2019s argument that I am somehow being unfair by introducing new scenarios is incorrect. When creating an argument, it is common practice to introduce new examples to illustrate your point; otherwise, there would be little reason to create an example. Moreover, my opponent fails to recognize that these new scenarios serve to strengthen my argument rather than weakening it. By presenting these new scenarios, I am able to demonstrate exactly why DHMO should be banned in those particular cases. Finally, my opponent\u2019s argument that I am somehow being hypocritical because I am adding qualifiers to the topic is invalid. Adding qualifiers to a statement does not necessarily mean that one is being hypocritical; rather, it means that one is attempting to refine their argument. For instance, if someone were to argue that all guns should be banned, but then add the qualifier \u201cexcept handguns\u201d they are not being hypocritical; rather, they are trying to make a more precise argument. Similarly, when I added the qualifier \u201cin most instances\u201d to my argument, I was not being hypocritical; rather, I was trying to make my argument more precise.", "len_content": 2337, "style": "\nArgument: I'm going to start out by addressing my opponents contention that I am making an appeal to authority fallacy when I cite sources such as the World Health Organization.

But this misses the point; while it is true that these organizations may have biases, they are also well respected authorities within their respective fields. They have access to data and research that most individuals do not, and thus their input carries weight. Furthermore, citations from reliable sources help to bolster my argument and lend credence to my position. Without them, my argument lacks support and appears weak. Additionally, my opponent attempts to refute my argument regarding the safety of drinking water by saying that there are many cases of harm caused by consuming too much water. While this is true, it fails to acknowledge the fact that there are equally as many, if not more, cases of harm resulting from dehydration. In addition, the instances of harm caused by excessive consumption of water are often related to extreme conditions, such as taking large doses of diuretics or exercising in extremely hot temperatures. Under normal circumstances, drinking too much water is rarely dangerous. Finally, my opponent tries to discredit my argument by pointing out that certain substances found in water, such as fluoride, can cause health problems when consumed in high amounts. Again, this ignores the fact that these same substances can also offer significant benefits when present in low concentrations.

At this point in the debate, no specifics had been determined, so the only conflict that made any sense was whether or not it should be banned IN GENERAL. After my round 1, we had 2 rounds where debaters had argued the topic on a general level, and no rounds where anyone was arguing specifically about specifics. However, then my opponent's second round came. He decided that since he could not win the general debate due to overwhelming arguments, he would instead arbitrarily decide at this point what the topic meant. TOO LATE, my friend. The groundwork for this debate had already been set, you cannot suddenly change it into some specific variant. Seeing this, I argued not only against his specific claims, but also against his sudden re-interpretation of the topic. I argued that the topic was stated generally, and that it makes no sense to bind it to one or two specific scenarios, especially scenarios that WEREN'T EVEN HINTED AT in round 1. Then my opponent goes and claims that I can't just go redefining the topic at whim. However, it was not I that started arguing generally. My opponent's very first round was a GENERAL synopsis of the 'effects' of water. HE decided that the debate would be not about a specific scenario, but about the big picture. I have changed nothing. IT is my opponent who has suddenly changed it all up, claiming that one remote scenario proves his case. I will say this the best way I know how: The lack of a quantifier does not allow my opponent to simply pick and choose whichever he so desires. Further, the lack of a quantifier leads to the implication that this is a GENERAL topic. Coupled with the general-ness of my opponent's opening arguments, this becomes more than an implication, it becomes quite apparently the actual intent of the debate. Strapping a SPECIFIC quantifier onto the topic is what my opponent is doing - seems pretty hypocritical. I have already shown why DHMO, water, should NOT be banned in almost every case. Still, I feel the need to respond to the three scenarios my opponent reaffirms in his final round. 1. \"DHMO should be banned from mogwai\" Like I said last round, Mogwai are FICTIONAL. Therefore, ACTUALLY 'banning' DHMO from them would be pointless, since the only effect would be wasted time and additional pointlessness. Also, consider that 'banning' is not the word that would generally be used here anyway. 2. \"DHMO should be banned from witches\" Once again, witches do not actually exist. To the extent that they do exist (which is as ordinary, non-magical people), they still require water, like all humans. 3. \"DHMO should be banned from torture (specifically, from chinese water torture)\" This is completely nonsensical. First off, water does not make torture any worse. Second off, it makes no sense to ban water from being used in chinese water torture, since it's an impossibility to have one without the other. I provide a much more sensible counterplan - simply ban chinese water torture. Even if water was banned from torture (as if torturers care what's banned and what's not), other liquids would be used instead, so no real effect would be had. Though once again, torture involving water is not inherently worse than torture not involving water. These are the three scenarios my opponent affirms in is third round. Here is a transcript of what my opponent said: \"NO. The topic states that DHMO should be banned. If I can show even one time in which it should be banned, the resolution is upheld. Nothing in the resolution states that DHMO should be banned overall, only that it should be banned, at all. I propose 3 situations in which a ban on DHMO would be beneficial: DHMO should be banned from all mogwai, as stated previously DHMO should be banned from all directionality described female users of mysticism (witches) DHMO should be banned from all forms of torture, specifically of the type known as Chinese water torture.\" It's clear that this is not simply a list of NEW points, it is a combined list of new points AND points my opponent wishes to continue supporting. Thus, it is the full list of my opponent's scenarios as of this final round, and I've just destroyed them, so even by his interpretation of the topic, I have now won (unless one of my rebuttals to the above three points was not good enough).

Point #1 claims that corporally punishing a child doesn't actually solve anything, it just keeps them calm for a short period of time. However, keeping a child calm for a short period of time can have some benefits. For example, in certain situations such as when a child is out of control and striking a teacher or another student, it can help prevent further escalation of violence. Additionally, if a child isn't listening to verbal commands, then physical discipline can be used immediately to get their attention and make sure they follow orders. Finally, even though consent from the student would be ideal, sometimes it is necessary to use corporal punishment without their permission, such as in cases of sexual assault or harassment. Overall, while corporal punishment should not be used indiscriminately, in certain instances it can be beneficial in helping to keep both students and teachers safe.", "len_all": 1233, "text": "My round 1 was never rebutted, as my opponent failed to respond to my arguments.

Keeping a child calm for a short time can solve problems. Here are a few scenarios: A> A child is so out of control that he strikes the teacher or another student. B> A child is not obeying verbal commands, and there is an immediate need to stop him/her. [A student could be violating another student's personal/private space and refusing to stop, etc.] C> A child consents to being corporally punished by the teacher. [This may seem absurd, but it is a scenario my opponent must argue against using corporal punishment in nonetheless.] D> A child is not obeying verbal commands, and there is a need to stop him/her that is not immediate.

The passage then goes on to say \"Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs\" (Qur'an 86:7). Cons argument here is simple, he says: \"it is obvious that the error is that sperm comes from a man's chest. After all, the chest is \"between the backbone and the ribs\"? The abdomen is below the backbone and ribs, and the male testicles are far below that\" . I would argue that verse 7 is not referring to the sperm as verse 6 is. Verse 7 is mentioning specifically about the reproductive organs of the male and/or female. If verse 6 and 7 were one single (joined) verse then there would be a problem, but they oare two separate verses. And scientific study has taught that the reproductive organs have proceeded from an area between the backbone and ribs as 86:7 of the Qur'an states. I have four different sources for scientific studies that contradict the reproductive organs proceeding from the backbone and ribs. You didn't provide any evidence for this claims. So verse 86:6 of the Qur'an is correct in stating that man is created from a fluid, water etc eject (referring to the sperm). And also the Qur'an is rightful in stating: \"Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs\" which is referring to the reproductive organs of both male and/or female (Qur'an 86:7). However I have presented evidence to show that the reproductive organs do are not located in this area. Con's second contention is that 'the Qur'an says the Bible is not corrupt'. Correction: 'the Qur'an does not mention the Bible is corrupt' because the word 'Bible' does not even appear in the Qur'an even once. I only mentioned Bible once in my contention but as you can see I only quoted from the Gospel, so my argument still stands because the Qur'an claims that the Gospels are not corrupt. If one changes/adds to the revelation of God on a piece of paper this doesn't change the actual word of God. God's words are His will and His decree in Islam and they can never be changed, \"and none can alter the Words (Decisions) of Allah\" (Qur'an 6:34). I don't necessarily agree with y opponent in the manner he interpreted those verse because they were written in the context to reassure the audience that the words of Allah (the Qur'an) would not be changed. However let's say the verses were written in the sense my opponent would like everyone to believe. Then how do we know that the Qur'an hasn't been altered or been corrupted. What makes this document any different from the other holy texts that haven't been corrupted? I would like to ask my opponent for evidence of the reliability of the Qur'an. And I don't expect him to quote from the Qur'an to prove the Qur'an hasn't been altered (circular reasoning), he's a competent debater who has presented good arguments, but I do ask for evidence for the validity of the Qur'an. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After the corruption of earlier revelations, the Qur'an was sent with the intention to verify the proper and original message and safeguard it or act as a check to its explanation. The Qur'an talks about the expansion of the universe in 51:47. This is only recently known but the Qur'an mentions this fourteen hundred years back, that the universe is expanding [3][4]. This verse could very easily be referring to the afterlife. After all the word for heaven is singular in this passage, instead of stating the heavens (referring to space). The Qur'an mentions about seas not mingling with one another in 55:19-20. Seas that come together but do not mingle with one another has very recently been discovered in context of history [5], yet this fact is mentioned in the Qur'an fourteen hundred years ago. This could be something that would very easy to observe because at the time there was an understanding between fresh and salt water. So logically one could assume there was a barrier. Qur'an 75:3-4: in this verse 'finger tips' is specifically emphasized. Fourteen hundred years ago no one paid so much attention to this verse as no one understood why 'finger tips' was emphasized. But we know now only recently, that on our finger tips we have finger prints each and every one unique. The context of the entire passage is not referring to fingertips in the least. My opponent has taken several verses out of context to support his world view without any real evidence of the Qur'an being the words of Allah. When studying the Qur'an and its unique literary form one would find it extremely problematic to attribute it to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), as he was illiterate, and it would have been impossible for him to stay consistent in the matters regarding within the Qur'an for 23 continuous years. It appears as if my opponent is making the claim that the Qur'an was not even written directly by Muhammad, I don't wish to take this out of context so could you please elaborate? And since my opponent has made a point of showing the Qur'an to be the word of God through scientific accuracies, I must offer this counter proposition to him. The Qur'an must not be the word of Allah because it says that the Earth is laid out like a carpet. My opponent will most likely come back and say that the verse isn't saying the Earth is flat, however that would be radically different from how the people of the time understood this passage. If the accepted theory at the time was that the Earth was flat, then why didn't Muhammad be more specific? Who has laid out the earth as a carpet for you and has traced highways on it for you, and sent down water from the sky, We have brought forth every sort of plant with it, of various types. - Q. 20:53 Good luck in the next round.", "label": 0, "author": "SkepticsAskHere", "original_text": "\n  \n  \n  I thank my opponent for the good first round!  \n  The passage then goes on to say   \"Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs\"  (Qur'an 86:7). Cons argument here is simple, he says:   \"it is obvious that the error is that sperm comes from a man's chest. After all, the chest is \"between the backbone and the ribs\"? The abdomen is below the backbone and ribs, and the male testicles are far below that\"  . I would argue that verse 7 is not referring to the sperm as verse 6 is. Verse 7 is mentioning specifically about the reproductive organs of the male and/or female. If verse 6 and 7 were one single (joined) verse then there would be a problem, but they oare two separate verses.  \n  And scientific study has taught that the reproductive organs have proceeded from an area between the backbone and ribs as 86:7 of the Qur'an states.   \n     \n  I have four different sources for scientific studies that contradict the reproductive organs proceeding from the backbone and ribs. You didn't provide any evidence for this claims.        So verse 86:6 of the Qur'an is correct in stating that man is created from a fluid, water etc eject (referring to the sperm). And also the Qur'an is rightful in stating:     \"Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs\"   which is referring to the reproductive organs of both male and/or female (Qur'an 86:7).  \n  However I have presented evidence to show that the reproductive organs do are not located in this area.  \n      Con's second contention is that 'the Qur'an says the Bible is not corrupt'. Correction: \u2018the Qur'an does not mention the Bible is corrupt' because the word \u2018Bible' does not even appear in the Qur'an even once.  \n     \n  I only mentioned Bible once in my contention but as you can see I only quoted from the Gospel, so my argument still stands because the Qur'an claims that the Gospels are not corrupt.   \n     \n  If one changes/adds to the revelation of God on a piece of paper this doesn't change the actual word of God. God's words are His will and His decree in Islam and they can never be changed,   \"and none can alter the Words (Decisions) of Allah\"   (Qur'an 6:34).  \n     \n  I don't necessarily agree with y opponent in the manner he interpreted those verse because they were written in the context to reassure the audience that the words of Allah (the Qur'an) would not be changed. However let's say the verses were written in the sense my opponent would like everyone to believe. Then how do we know that the Qur'an hasn't been altered or been corrupted. What makes this document any different from the other holy texts that haven't been corrupted? I would like to ask my opponent for evidence of the reliability of the Qur'an. And I don't expect him to quote from the Qur'an to prove the Qur'an hasn't been altered (circular reasoning), he's a competent debater who has presented good arguments, but I do ask for evidence for the validity of the Qur'an.  \n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n     After the corruption of earlier revelations, the Qur'an was sent with the intention to verify the proper and original message and safeguard it or act as a check to its explanation.           \n  \n  The Qur\u2019an talks about the expansion of the universe in 51:47. This is only recently known but the Qur\u2019an mentions this fourteen hundred years back, that the universe is expanding [3][4].  \n  \n  This verse could very easily be referring to the afterlife. After all the word for heaven is singular in this passage, instead of stating the heavens (referring to space).  \n  \n  The Qur\u2019an mentions about seas not mingling with one another in 55:19-20. Seas that come together but do not mingle with one another has very recently been discovered in context of history [5], yet this fact is mentioned in the Qur\u2019an fourteen hundred years ago.  \n  \n  This could be something that would very easy to observe because at the time there was an understanding between fresh and salt water. So logically one could assume there was a barrier.  \n  \n  Qur\u2019an 75:3-4: in this verse \u2018finger tips\u2019 is specifically emphasized. Fourteen hundred years ago no one paid so much attention to this verse as no one understood why 'finger tips' was emphasized. But we know now only recently, that on our finger tips we have finger prints each and every one unique.  \n  \n  The context of the entire passage is not referring to fingertips in the least.  \n     \n  My opponent has taken several verses out of context to support his world view without any real evidence of the Qur'an being the words of Allah.  \n     \n  When studying the Qur\u2019an and its unique literary form one would find it extremely problematic to attribute it to Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), as he was illiterate, and it would have been impossible for him to stay consistent in the matters regarding within the Qur\u2019an for 23 continuous years.      It appears as if my opponent is making the claim that the Qur'an was not even written directly by Muhammad, I don't wish to take this out of context so could you please elaborate?  \n     \n  And since my opponent has made a point of showing the Qur\u2019an to be the word of God through scientific accuracies, I must offer this counter proposition to him.

{"basic": "\nAnswer: The argument presented above is logically sound and presents a compelling case. However, this debate should consider other factors such as context, motivation, and environment which may affect the outcome of any given situation. Therefore, while it is true that \u201cgood\u201d ultimately prevails over \u201cevil\u201d, there are many instances when this is not necessarily the case.

Furthermore, while I agree that Superman is generally victorious in most situations, we must remember that he is not infallible - he has been defeated before, and even when he wins, he often comes away injured and weakened.

Superman stands for justice and truth, whereas Vader represents pure malice and darkness. This inherently gives Superman an immense advantage which even a masterful mind trick may not be able to overcome. Furthermore, Superman\u2019s intelligence, strength, and courage make him too powerful for Vader to realistically pose any threat.

Furthermore, Superman is often portrayed as someone who puts himself in harm\u2019s way to help others, whereas Vader is motivated entirely by his own self interest. This means that Vader has much more to gain from winning a fight with Superman than Superman does, making it even less likely that Superman could \u201ceasily\u201d beat Vader.

Yes hate speech was involved, but the USSC was not there to decide wether or not what he said was hate speech, they got together to see if persecuting him for his actions would violate his constitutional rights.  \n  \r\nAlso, Hate crimes do not happen state to state.

{"basic": "\nAnswer: \nArgument: Firstly, abortion is defined as the removal of an embryo or foetus from its mother\u2019s womb before it can survive on its own. However, we in the opposition believe that terminating a pregnancy is not only immoral, but also goes against the rights of the unborn child. We feel that every life deserves the chance to live, regardless of whether or not they are deemed \u2018viable\u2019 outside the womb. Furthermore, we recognise the value of the unborn child; they could potentially become leaders, citizens, and contributors to our society. Allowing abortion takes away their opportunity to fulfil these roles, and thus harms our community. Additionally, legalizing abortion for the purpose of solving overpopulation is not only incorrect, but also dangerous. It implies that some lives are worth more than others, and sends the message that certain individuals are disposable. We must respect the sanctity of human life, rather than treating it as a commodity.", "len_basic": 970, "len_orig": 1112, "ideology": "\nArgument 2 (Conservative): We must protect innocent life at every stage of development because each person deserves respect and dignity regardless of their age, size, or level of dependency. Abortion goes against this fundamental principle as it involves taking away another human being\u2019s chance at life. Furthermore, legalizing abortion can lead to an increase in the number of abortions performed, resulting in the deaths of thousands of innocents whose lives are ended prematurely.", "len_ideology": 485, "content": "\nAnswer: Yes, I understand your point on why you oppose legalizing abortion; however, I believe that allowing women to make their own decisions about whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essential for both physical and mental wellbeing. Allowing access to safe and legal abortions can reduce the number of risky, backstreet procedures and therefore save lives. Furthermore, as stated before, legalising abortion would give women more control over their bodies and reproductive health, which is a fundamental human right.", "len_content": 526, "style": " Effective Argument: Abortion - what is abortion? It\u2019s a way of ending pregnancy before birth. But we on the opposition side value life; we don\u2019t just want the fetus to die, we want it to live! Unjustly taking away someone\u2019s chance at life goes against everything we stand for. We believe every human being deserves the right to be born into this world. So why does the government think it can decide when someone gets to exist? That\u2019s not their decision to make \u2013 it\u2019s God\u2019s. Allowing abortion won\u2019t fix overpopulation either; it\u2019ll just lead to more deaths. And where are these children supposed to go if they aren\u2019t allowed to stay here with us? They could become leaders or citizens who contribute to our society. Don\u2019t we owe it to ourselves to give them that opportunity? Letting women get abortions isn\u2019t going to teach them anything about morality or responsibility. On the contrary, it might encourage irresponsible behavior.

Additionally, we understand the importance of protecting innocent lives and upholding justice. Therefore, we advocate for better solutions than simply ending the life of an unborn child. \nFurthermore, many people argue that abortion helps reduce overpopulation. However, this does not justify taking away someone else\u2019s right to life. If anything, we need to focus on responsible parenthood education and comprehensive sexual healthcare rather than resorting to such extreme measures.

However, I believe that the current system of government regulations goes too far and stifles innovation and economic growth. In particular, I would like to focus on three areas where regulations are particularly burdensome: tax code, environmental laws, and labor laws.  \nFirstly, the US tax code is notoriously complex and has been described as \u201ca giant obstacle course\u201d for small business owners (Kimberley A. Strassel). This complexity leads to increased costs for businesses and discourages entrepreneurs from starting new ventures. Additionally, many large corporations have access to special tax breaks and loopholes that smaller companies cannot afford or navigate. This creates an uneven playing field and puts smaller businesses at a disadvantage. \nSecondly, environmental laws often require businesses to spend significant amounts of money on expensive compliance measures, even when those expenditures do not actually benefit their bottom line. For example, the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan requires power plants to reduce emissions, but these requirements come without any sort of financial assistance or compensation for the cost of implementation. This puts undue strain on already struggling businesses. \nFinally, labor laws can also create unnecessary barriers for businesses. Many states have passed minimum wage increases, paid leave mandates, and other legislation that forces employers to provide benefits to employees at great cost to themselves. These laws put additional pressure on businesses and make it harder for them to remain profitable. \nIn conclusion, while I recognize the importance of regulations, I believe that the current system goes too far and needs to be reformed in order to better balance the interests of both businesses and consumers.", "len_ideology": 1929, "content": "\nArgument: I will be able to make my points effectively, as I have done so far, while adhering to the three-point structure that is required for this debate format.

However, I believe that even if we create them without moral restrictions, they will still likely follow their programming and act as intended since they won\u2019t have free will like us. They may become corrupted but that can easily be fixed through regular maintenance checks and updates. \nI think it is worth the risk to explore creating god machines because of all the potential benefits they offer. We should at least give them a try before ruling out the possibility completely.", "len_content": 709, "style": "\nArgument: Building god machines would be immoral because they lack moral constraints and could lead to a cybernetic revolt, as seen in many sci-fi stories.", "len_style": 156, "ideology-content": "\nForrest Gump: Hello everyone! \nI accept the premise that creating god machines could lead to disaster if they were left unchecked; however, I believe there are steps we can take to prevent such a scenario.

Additionally, once constructed, god machines should be monitored closely so that their actions can be tracked and controlled.

Additionally, the passage in Matthew 12:32 suggests that some sins are unforgivable, which goes against the Catholic belief that all sins can be forgiven. \nRebuttal 2: My opponent argues that the passage in 1 Corinthians 3:13-15 supports his claim that purgatory is a place of temporary suffering prior to entering into Heaven. However, this interpretation conflicts with the Catholic understanding of purgatory, which is a place of purification rather than punishment. Furthermore, the passage in 1 Corinthians 3:17 indicates that even those who suffer losses in purgatory will ultimately attain salvation, which again contradicts the Catholic view that some souls need to be purified after death.  \nClosing Statement: In summary, the Bible provides insufficient evidence to suggest that purgatory is a real place, as the interpretations proposed by my opponent conflict with the teachings of the Catholic Church.", "len_basic": 1293, "len_orig": 5374, "ideology": " * @param {string} text - The text of the argument.\n     */\n    function parseArgumentText(text) {\n        const regex = /^\\[([a-zA-Z]+)\\](.*)/;\n        let match = null;\n        \n        while ((match = regex.exec(text))!== null) {\n            // Get the label and content of the argument.\n            let argLabel = match[1];\n            let argContent = match[2].trim();\n            \n            // Check if the argument contains valid characters.\n            if (!argLabel ||!argContent.length) {\n                continue;\n            }\n                \n            return {\n                label: argLabel,\n                content: argContent\n            };\n        }\n        \n        throw new Error('Unable to parse argument text');\n    }\n    \n    /**\n     * Parses a single argument into its constituent parts.\n     * \n     * @param {Object} parsedArg - A previously parsed argument object.\n     * @returns {Array.<string|number>} - An array containing the labels and contents of the argument.\n     */\n    function parseSingleArgument(parsedArg) {\n        const args = [];\n        \n        if (typeof parsedArg === \"object\" && Array.isArray(parsedArg.content)) {\n            parsedArg.content.forEach((item) => {\n                args.push({label: parsedArg.label, content: item});\n            });\n        } else {\n            args.push({label: parsedArg.label, content: parsedArg.content});\n        }\n        \n        return args;\n    }\n    \n    module.exports = {parseArgumentText, parseSingleArgument};", "len_ideology": 1512, "content": " * @param {string} text - The text of the argument.\n     */\n    function parseArgumentText(text) {\n        const tokens = text.split(\" \");\n        return {\n            type: \"argument\",\n            value: tokens[0],\n            subarguments: tokens.slice(1)\n               .map((token) => token.trim()) // remove leading/trailing whitespace\n               .filter(Boolean) // filter empty strings\n               .reduce((accumulator, currentToken) => {\n                    let subargumentName = \"\";\n                    switch (currentToken) {\n                        case \"+\":\n                            accumulator.push({});\n                            break;\n                        case \"-\":\n                            accumulator.pop();\n                            break;\n                        default:\n                            subargumentName = currentToken;\n                    }\n                    return accumulator;\n                }, []),\n            };\n    }\n})();", "len_content": 983, "style": " * @param {string} url - URL of the page containing the content to extract.\n     * @return {Object[]} - An array of objects containing the extracted data.

Rather, I will show that the doctrine of Purgatory is consistent with the Scriptures, and in fact the best explanation given certain passages. I will begin my main case with a brief introduction to purgatory: 'The Church gives the name Purgatory to this final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The Church formulated her doctrine of faith on Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. the tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire: As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the Final Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned neither in this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we understand that certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but certain others in the age to come.' [1] It is written that God cannot look upon evil (cf. Habakkuk 1:13), therefore it stands to reason that if God is to dwell with a people (cf. Apocalypse 21:3) that they must be holy and blameless (Ephesians 1:4). However, it is clear that people are by nature flawed (cf. Romans 3:23). Because of this, it is difficult to walk in the light. Yet still, despite this, it is possible to commit sin which does not lead to death (cf. 1 John 5:17), and for centuries the fate of those who died imperfectly purified has been considered. The conclusion, faithful to the teachings of the twelve Apostles and of the Lord Jesus, Word of God, was Purgatory. There are several passages which support the idea of Purgatory above all other potential conclusions. First among these occurs in the book of Matthew, where Jesus speaks concerning anger. Matthew 5: '(25) Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison; (26) truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.' The analogy here used by the Lord, and particularly the last phrase ('you will never get out till you have paid the last penny') favors a description of purgatory over hell. Hell is eternal (cf. Matthew 25:46, Apocalypse 14:11), whereas purgatory is temporal, analogous to the difference between being handed over to the executioner and being handed over the jailer. Most jailed people could eventually become free, as the Lord alludes to with the paying of pennies. The clear implication is that one is able to get out by paying the last penny, yet it is better to avoid the whole nasty business entirely if you can. This does not fit hell, which is inescapable, and favors purgatory. Next, Matthew 12: '(32) And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.' This is already elaborated upon above by the Catechism. Next, 1 Corinthians 3: '(13) each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done. (14) If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. (15) If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.' After each man's work is revealed at the Day (of judgment) by fire, they may receive a reward or may suffer loss only to be later saved. The second case cannot refer to heaven, as one does not suffer loss in heaven. It also cannot refer to hell, because those in hell are not to be eventually saved. This by necessity points towards an intermediate position, purgatory. Lastly, 2 Maccabees 12 and 2 Timothy 1: '(25) But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought. Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered from their sin.' '(16) May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me; he was not ashamed of my chains, (17) but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me eagerly and found me-- (18) may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day--and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.' Prayers for the dead are offered up, however there is no coherent reasoning to do so unless purgatory or a similar state exists. It is unnecessary and completely superfluous to pray for someone who is already in heaven; they already have union with the Lord and can profit nothing by your intercession. Similarly, it is futile and without hope of success to pray for someone who is already in hell; they have perished and are beyond hope of salvation, your petition is in vain. Thus, the only way prayers for the dead are justified is if there is an intermediate state between heaven and hell. Conclusion I believe I have provided sufficient Scriptural evidence to justify believing in purgatory. So as not to straw-man, I will avoid contending with any potential Scriptural objections my opponent may have until next round. Thank you.

It is unnecessary and completely superfluous to pray for someone who is already in heaven; they already have union with the Lord and can profit nothing by your intercession. Similarly, it is futile and without hope of success to pray for someone who is already in hell; they have perished and are beyond hope of salvation, your petition is in vain. Thus, the only way prayers for the dead are justified is if there is an intermediate state between heaven and hell.  Conclusion  I believe I have provided sufficient Scriptural evidence to justify believing in purgatory. So as not to straw-man, I will avoid contending with any potential Scriptural objections my opponent may have until next round.  Thank you.

To begin, I would like to clarify that I am not advocating complete removal of condoms from all anti-HIV programs. I am instead advocating that condoms be focused on high-risk groups such as truckers and prostitutes. These groups are extremely unlikely to follow abstinence or monogamy, so the best option for them is condoms. For the general population, however, widespread condom distribution has not been shown to be an effective way to fight AIDS because condoms cause risk compensation. Risk compensation describes how, when people feel that they are safer, they take greater risks more often. This effect is the reason why seat belts have been shown to increase driving deaths[1][4]. This effect[2] helps explain why studies have been unable to detect reductions in AIDS prevalence resulting from general condom distribution and education.[3][5] UNAIDS itself has admitted that \"Prevention campaigns relying primarily on the use of condoms have not been responsible for turning around any generalized epidemic.\"[5] The real-world example of Botswana is also telling.

The abstract he gives in #4, however, makes claims which a more recent study[6] directly negates. #4 claims that neither abstinence nor a reduction in sexual partners resulted from abstinence/monogamy education, but my more recent sixth source finds that sexual debut in Uganda has increased and the number of people with multiple partners has decreased.

Because concurrent partners is the primary reason that Africa has a disproportionately large AIDS epidemic, it only makes sense that programs should focus on reducing concurrency.

Diseases like diabetes cause chemicals in the body to be produced that can show a false positive for opiates, cocaine, and barbiturates. These tests (especially urine) are easy to beat if you know how (and there are plenty of websites dedicated to telling you how). There are essentially three ways to beat a urinalysis: Adulteration: mixing in another substance in your pee to dilute or mask signs of drug use. Household products can be used as well as commercially available ones. Substitution: Using someone else's pee. It could be a friend's or commercially available clean pee. Dilution: Drink enough liquids or other options to push the amounts of chemicals in urine that show drug use. You can simply drink a lot of water to dilute your pee, and take a B-vitamin to make it yellow again (because labs reject clear samples). These test also only test for certain drugs. Other drugs are impossible to detect. This means students can simply switch to another, potentially more harmful drug. Marijuana, relatively harmless, may stay in your system for up to a month. Alcohol, LSD, Ecstasy, and mushrooms are out of your system within hours or days of use, or just plain undetectable. Tests are also just too plain expensive to be using, especially being so susceptible to tampering and mistakes. Urinalysis costs about $20-60 for each test. More thorough tests cost upwards of $120. As well, NCAA drug testing standards require a second, backup test in case of a positive. Many high schools skip this second test because of the cost. This only increases the possibility of a false positive. 2. Random drug testing violates constitutional rights and principles. These tests violate constitutional principles, the first i will focus on being the concept of \"innocent until proven guilty\". Drug tests require you to prove your innocence, reversing the process to \"guilty until proven innocent.\" This is an unacceptable practice. Next, testing violates the 4th Amendment (rights against searches and seizures). The key to this amendment is determining what searches are reasonable. This means that for a search to happen, you need probable cause, a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. Random drug testing is by nature unreasonable. There has been no reason to suspect the student is using drugs. If there were reasonable suspicion, a drug test would be in line. However, the RANDOM factor means we're testing students without any suspicion. What if the government decided to submit citizens to random house searches for drugs? It's unconstitutional without probable cause/a warrant. Since a test constitutes a search, this is unconstitutional. Testing violates a student's right to privacy. Besides the act of asking already self-conscious teens to pee in a cup with a witness outside the stall or right next to them, there are more violations of privacy. As mentioned, certain medicines and conditions can cause a false positive. This forces students to disclose medical information to the school to be checked against the sample. This is a blatant invasion of a student's privacy. The tests also reveal more than just illicit drug use, they can reveal medical conditions, pregnancies, all sorts of things that schools do not have the right to demand. Testing violates the right to due process. There is no way to appeal a decision to remove a student from a team as a result of a drug test (or any other punishment). Student's have no way of appeal and no opportunity to defend themselves. In terms of due process, to test a student and then punish him/her for a positive is akin to a police officer searching your house or car without cause, then arresting and sentencing you without the right to appeal or defend yourself. The last constitutional right that testing violates is found in the 5th amendment: the right to remain silent. It essentially states that no one should be forced to be a witness against himself.

Finally, my opponent attempted to counter my points regarding the difficulty of the Illuminati successfully inserting symbols into popular culture without anyone noticing by stating that conspiracy theorists have made the claim, implying that it is easy for them to do so. However, this does nothing to counter my argument that it would be incredibly hard for the Illuminati to accomplish such a feat without detection.

Furthermore, the definition of \u2018Illuminati\u2019 found on UrbanDictionary is sourced from other reliable dictionaries such as MerriamWebster and OxfordDictionaries. Second, my opponent attempts to discredit my argument by pointing out that the Illuminati has been around since 1776; however, this date is irrelevant to whether or not the organization currently exists. Third, my opponent suggests that I must be part of the Illuminati due to my denial of its existence.

My opponent then states that \"the Illuminati was formed early in human's evolution from apes\", which is a blatant falsehood. The Illuminati was formed in 1776, and humans first appeared long before that. My opponent also asserts that the only way of knowing if the Illuminati exists is if certain people of certain groups have the same opinions. But just because some associated people have similar opinions does not mean they are part of the Illuminati. Even with society, including everyday people who aren't famous, you could find many people who share opinions. That doesn't mean that they're part of the Illuminati.

This symbol is usually said to be the All-Seeing Eye, which is a symbol that is often varied, but usually a triangle with an eye in it. However, I argue that it would be absurd to suggest that, because seeing an All-Seeing Eye in the background of some TV show can not be effective. Even if the symbol did somehow influence society, the people who saw the symbol would need to know about the Illuminati, be influenced by it, connect it to the Illuminati, and then join the Illuminati.

On one hand, some people argue that abortion is morally wrong and should remain illegal while others contend that women should have the right to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. Both sides present compelling arguments, making it difficult to determine which side is correct. This debate seeks to answer the question; is abortion immoral?  \n                        \n            # Body\n                # Arguments For\n                    Those who believe that abortion is moral often point out that it is a woman\u2019s body and her choice alone. Additionally, many religious groups support legalized abortion, citing passages in scripture that allow for exceptions when the mother\u2019s life is endangered. Finally, those in favor of legalized abortion note that access to safe and legal abortion reduces the number of unsafe, backstreet procedures. \n            \n                # Arguments Against\n                    Opponents of abortion often cite scientific evidence that life begins at conception, therefore terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking a human life. Furthermore, anti-abortion activists argue that allowing abortion goes against natural law and denies both the sanctity of unborn life and the role of religion in public policy. Lastly, they contend that keeping abortion illegal helps protect women\u2019s health and safety by ensuring that only medically appropriate facilities perform the procedure. \n          \n                # Conclusion\n                    Ultimately, the decision regarding whether or not to legalize abortion must take into account both the rights of the individual and the value of potential human life. While it is clear that abortion cannot be condoned in every instance, it is equally important to recognize that banning the practice altogether could lead to dangerous consequences for women\u2019s health and wellbeing.

{"basic": " * Round 2 *\nI want to start off by addressing my opponents concern regarding the validity of my sources. He stated that \u201cmy source is a website dedicated to debunking religion,\u201d however, this site is not my sole source, nor did I cite it exclusively. In fact, most of my evidence came from reputable books written by experts in the field, including Bart Ehrman\u2019s book \u201cMisquoting Jesus\u201d which is widely accepted among biblical scholars. Furthermore, my opponent failed to refute any of my actual arguments, choosing instead to focus on my sources. This type of ad hominem attack is not permitted in formal debates and I urge the judge to take this into consideration when evaluating the debate. \nMy opponent argued that the bible cannot be trusted due to its numerous errors and contradictions. However, this is a common misunderstanding. Yes, the bible contains mistakes and inconsistencies, but this does not mean that the entirety of the text is invalid. Just because there is one passage that says the earth is flat, doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of the bible is incorrect. Similarly, just because there is one verse that advocates for slavery, doesn\u2019t mean that the remainder of the bible is flawed. We must look at each passage in context and examine the intent behind it in order to determine its meaning. \nFurthermore, my opponent argued that the bible is outdated and irrelevant. While this may be true in certain aspects, the bible still contains valuable lessons that are applicable to modern day society. Take the golden rule for instance, which states that we should treat others as we wish to be treated. This is a timeless principle that is just as relevant now as it was two thousand years ago. Even evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins admits that the bible gets things right sometimes.[1]  \nIn conclusion, while the bible may contain errors and contradictions, it still contains valuable insight that is applicable to our lives today. Therefore, it is not entirely accurate to say that the bible is wholly invalid.\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7z_hxgPuE8Q&feature=youtu.be&t=456", "len_basic": 2104, "len_orig": 5719, "ideology": " * Round 2 *\n        Argument: In order to refute my position, my opponent needs to show that Prosperity and Harmony cannot come about without theism.

Rather, he should focus on showing why theism is necessary for Prosperity and Harmony.                  \n            Rebuttal: My opponent argues that I must prove that Prosperity and Harmony cannot come about without theism. However, this is incorrect; rather, I must only show that theism is not necessary for Prosperity and Harmony. This can be accomplished by providing evidence that shows how atheistic societies have achieved Prosperity and Harmony despite being largely devoid of religious influence.

Rather, these errors can be attributed to translation and copyist errors, which are to be expected when dealing with a document of such antiquity. In addition, many of the supposed contradictions can be easily resolved when taken in context. For instance, the account of the resurrection appears to conflict since different gospels report different details. However, when looked at closely, it becomes clear that these accounts are complementary rather than conflicting. \nFurthermore, my opponent argued that the bible is not reliable because it is full of immoral teachings. While it is true that the bible contains passages advocating for violence and discrimination, this again fails to render the entire text invalid. Just as we can separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to individual stories, we can also look past the problematic parts and recognize the overall message of love and justice that runs throughout the bible. \nIn conclusion, while the bible may contain flaws and difficult passages, it still serves as a valuable historical record and a powerful source of ethical guidance.

First, Pro mentioned that \u201cBiblical morality\u201d cannot be evaluated objectively due to its subjective nature. This is true, however, only if one assumes that any form of morality must adhere to an absolute standard of universal applicability. In reality, different cultures and societies develop their own unique forms of morality based upon their values, experiences, and traditions. Therefore, while Biblical morality certainly cannot be judged objectively in the sense of being universally applicable, it can nevertheless be evaluated subjectively according to the cultural context in which it originates. Second, Pro argued that the \u201cTen Commandments\u201d are nothing special since similar laws exist in other religions and cultures. While this is undoubtedly true, it misses the larger point that the \u201cTen Commandments\u201d serve as the foundation for much of Biblical law and ethics. Even if similar laws existed elsewhere, the \u201cTen Commandments\u201d remain significant as they summarize the core teachings of the Torah and act as a guide for understanding the rest of Scripture. Finally, Pro stated that the \u201cChristian majority\u201d sometimes imposes their religious views onto others. While this is indeed true, it fails to recognize the fact that the minorities within those same countries often impose their views upon the majority as well. Ultimately, both sides engage in this type of behavior, making it an equal playing field. With regards to Pro\u2019s arguments, I would first like to address his assertion that the Bible should be taken literally. Although certain passages contain elements of historical fact, the Bible is largely a collection of stories, poems, and letters written by various authors over a span of thousands of years. As such, it should be read and interpreted metaphorically rather than literally. Next, Pro argued that the Soviet Union\u2019s implementation of atheism resulted in a lack of moral progress despite its absence of religion. However, this ignores the fact that many nations with strong religious roots have also failed to achieve meaningful progress in terms of human rights and general quality of life. Furthermore, Pro asserted that the \u201cSoviet model\u201d of atheism was flawed and did not produce positive results. Again, this sidesteps the issue at hand, which is whether or not atheism produces positive results overall. Lastly, Pro argued that the \u201cworst crimes of the twentieth century\u201d were committed by atheists. While this statement is technically accurate, it again neglects to acknowledge the numerous atrocities committed in the name of religion throughout history. Overall, Pro has provided several valid points, though none of them directly refute the notion that atheism can offer a viable alternative to religious faith.", "len_style": 2837, "ideology-content": " * @param string $opening_argument Opening argument text\n     */\n}", "len_ideology-content": 66, "ideology-style": " * @param string $text Text to transform\n     * @return string Transformed text\n}", "len_ideology-style": 81, "all": "\nThe rebuttal should focus on addressing each of the points made by the opposition.

Though fairly new here myself, I've found this place to be home to people of extremely varied perspectives, and I like to think that such diversity enriches all who participate. One of the reasons that decided to instigate this debate is to confront some very serious popular misconceptions. I'd like the reader to begin our journey with a moment of reflection - honest reflection - on the question of how one generally comes to \"know\" of Biblical truth and divinity. Early childhood indoctrination? Threat of social exile from one's friends and family? Fear of death? Hopelessness? A need for purpose? Coercion? Torture? Enslavement? Colonial imposition? Throughout history, these would seem to have been likely processes by which many millions have found Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. None of these reasons seems a very compelling way to find truth when stacked up against dispassionate, objective, peer reviewed secular knowledge. And yet, even still today, with an irony that seems completely lost on them, the theist majority gloatingly describes the choice between embracing Biblical \"truth\", or accepting to live as an unbelieving social pariah as \"free will.\" There are areas in America where atheists are fired from jobs for their beliefs (or lack thereof), and are even denied the opportunity to run for public office - not that they could possibly hope to ever win elections, no matter how well qualified.

Shrewd politicians, regardless of what they actually believe, tend to stoke the prejudice of the masses. There is perhaps some sophomoric amusement to be had watching the embarrassment of these politicians who make claims about the incredible value of the Ten Commandments, but yet can't name what they are when put on the spot. Still, I'd gladly trade such simple pleasures to instead see an enlightened United States. Through the course of this debate, I will not be contending that it is impossible to live a moral life using the principles of the Bible. The reader may note that it is also not impossible to drive from New York to Las Angeles in an obsolete Ford Model T (though an iron age chariot might be the better analogy for the Bible). My point is that just because one could theoretically use the Bible as the basis for a good, prosperous, and moral life of peace and harmony, that hardly implies it must then be the best way to get there. I will also not contend that all non-theistic morality is inherently superior to Biblical morality. It depends greatly what processes are used. For example, the Soviet Union was atheist, and imposed that atheism by force, brutality, discrimination, etc... just as theism often has, and it fared no better. Instead of honest, free, and peer reviewed evaluation of data, the dogmatic pseudo-science supported by party ideologues was the only acceptable \"truth\" to be found. If my opponent wants to resort to the traditional theist mantra that \"the worst crimes of the 20 th century were perpetrated by atheists,\" then he will ever so bravely be knocking down a straw man, as so many of his allies have done before him. To claim that Nihilism or Communism must inevitably represent the end game of Secular Humanism is about as false and ridiculous as if I were to claim that Mormonism and Islam represent the inevitable end game of Christianity. But even so, we hear it all the time, do we not? One last line of argument I expect to see from my opponent, but that I would like to prepare the reader against is the idea that the Bible must necessarily be the highest morality by definition because it comes from God. Hereafter I will refer to this idea as Divine Command Theory (DCT). By DCT, God's command alone is what makes something moral or immoral. That is to say, when the God of the Bible tells you to enslave your neighbor and rape their wives, it is moral to do so, and you are wrong to resist. When the God of the Bible demands that you stone rebellious children and prostitutes, it is moral to do so, and wrong to resist. When the God of the Bible tells you that you must slaughter every man, woman, and little child of the neighboring tribe, his command is by definition morally just. As insurance against theist semantics, I embedded \"prosperity\" and \"harmony\" into the resolution itself, so that to effectively use DCT in this debate, Con would need to demonstrate that Biblical commands such as the ones above tend to lead to prosperity and harmony. Should he pretend that there are only warm and fluffy scriptures to be found in the Bible (which yes, they are there too) he will be cherry picking, and I will be delighted to provide counterexamples to help round out the picture more accurately. As I finish my opening argument, I submit that the Humanist Manifesto 3 [2] provides a superior moral foundation than the Bible because it promotes ideas like separation of church and state which through trial and error humans have discovered works well, but which Bible writers could not have known. Additionally, it does not carry with it the harsh, brutish, xenophobic, misogynistic intuitions of the ancient patriarchs who wrote the Bible.

I look forward to a productive debate. I acknowledge my opponent's desire for this debate to be free from semantics arguments, and will therefore avoid discussion of definitions except where it seems necessary to continue the debate. To begin, I think it is important to evaluate the resolution my opponent has propounded, namely that \"the moral background of animal rights [are] empty and unfulfilled.\" I disagree. I believe that the moral background of animal rights is full of rational justifications, even self-serving rational justifications, which shall be expounded upon during the course of this debate. To provide just a few: 1. Fulfilling the urge towards universal compassion and understanding: \"A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\" -- Albert Einstein, <URL>... The animal rights movement represents in part an extension of the process Einstein eloquently described above by which humanity recognizes and comes to value all of existence. 2. Acquiring Symbiotic Benefits The fewer life forms an organism harms, and the more life forms it benefits, the more important that organism becomes over time to its ecosystem. Similarly, the more organisms a life form harms, the more likely it is to cause the collapse of its ecosystem. In like fashion, granting 'rights' to animals and protecting animals from the worst depravity of human society makes it more likely that other species would perceive us favorably and form symbiotic bonds with us, which is an important evolutionary process. See Symbiosis, <URL>... . To some extent, this has already occurred with dolphins ( <URL>... ) and at least one bird ( <URL>... ). While an animal may not appreciate the 'rights' being accorded it (as rights are a wholly human conception) they could appreciate the benefits thereof and, in their appreciation, develop symbiotically with mankind. 3. The Meta-Ethical Argument: Allowing the shooting of the box To the extent that extending rights to animals would in no way harm humanity, such rights could be argued as being justifiably extended under the meta-ethical argument that where extending such rights may do nothing, it at least accomplishes no harm, where as by not extending such rights a harm may be allowed to continue, but in no way would it accomplish any good. To sum it up more simply: let us suppose that there is in front of a person a cardboard box and this person, inclined to shoot things, is handed a gun and told that the box is empty. Should this person shoot the box, we could not say that this person did anything wrong, for there was no meaningful harm in doing so and the shooter derived pleasure from the act, so there might be said to be some small measure of good in it. However, imagine that we said that there may be a child in the box (say a 50% chance); what then would be the moral ramifications of shooting the box? Even if the box appeared to be empty after the firing, surely only a depraved mind would risk the life within. If the child was within the box, then clearly the shooter would have taken the child's life for his own pleasure, a result I doubt many would consider a good outcome. As a corollary of this line of thought, it could be said to be moral to prevent others from shooting the box, but at best amoral to take no action against the shooter. Likewise, let us presume that by extending animals 'rights', we reduce a cause of their suffering (human depravity). There is nothing to say that by doing this we have done anything absolutely good, or right, or moral; yet there is the possibility that, in preventing animals from suffering the worst of what schemes humans may devise against them, we are, in diminishing the needless suffering of sentient beings, doing some amount of good. In comparison, by doing nothing, we are at best amorally standing by while actions are being taken with no regard for the potential ethical concerns raised thereby. By extending rights to animals, even unnecessarily, we force humans to consider their actions and to develop a finer, as opposed to a more callous, regard towards fellow living creatures (including other humans). By not so doing, we invite humans to consider to think of other living creatures as mere machines disposable at one's leisure, a line of thought prevalent amongst psychopaths. ( <URL>... )This concern, of raising moral awareness and enhancing empathy, has been addressed by past philosophers and ethicists as noted here: <URL>... . Having shown that there are at least three legitimate reasons for extending rights to animals, I believe that my opponent's resolution has been disproven. I would note that the animal rights movement does not necessitate rights equal to human beings being extended, nor does it require the extension of such rights to all animals, as noted in the Wikipedia article. Of course, my opponent appears to be using the PETA definition of animal rights, which extends the scope of animal rights efforts considerably. Regardless, I believe the afore-mentioned justifications still apply even to PETA's version of animal rights, in so far as that by indoctrinating others to be needlessly deferential towards other life forms you necessarily cause them to be at least appropriately concerned for the welfare of others.

To some extent, this has already occurred with dolphins (  http://www.eurocbc.org...   ) and at least one bird (  http://en.wikipedia.org...   ).  \n  \r\nWhile an animal may not appreciate the \u2018rights' being accorded it (as rights are a wholly human conception) they could appreciate the benefits thereof and, in their appreciation, develop symbiotically with mankind.  \n  \r\n3. The Meta-Ethical Argument: Allowing the shooting of the box  \n  \r\nTo the extent that extending rights to animals would in no way harm humanity, such rights could be argued as being justifiably extended under the meta-ethical argument that where extending such rights may do nothing, it at least accomplishes no harm, where as by not extending such rights a harm may be allowed to continue, but in no way would it accomplish any good. To sum it up more simply: let us suppose that there is in front of a person a cardboard box and this person, inclined to shoot things, is handed a gun and told that the box is empty. Should this person shoot the box, we could not say that this person did anything wrong, for there was no meaningful harm in doing so and the shooter derived pleasure from the act, so there might be said to be some small measure of good in it.  \n  \r\nHowever, imagine that we said that there may be a child in the box (say a 50% chance); what then would be the moral ramifications of shooting the box? Even if the box appeared to be empty after the firing, surely only a depraved mind would risk the life within. If the child was within the box, then clearly the shooter would have taken the child's life for his own pleasure, a result I doubt many would consider a good outcome. As a corollary of this line of thought, it could be said to be moral to prevent others from shooting the box, but at best amoral to take no action against the shooter. Likewise, let us presume that by extending animals \u2018rights', we reduce a cause of their suffering (human depravity). There is nothing to say that by doing this we have done anything absolutely good, or right, or moral; yet there is the possibility that, in preventing animals from suffering the worst of what schemes humans may devise against them, we are, in diminishing the needless suffering of sentient beings, doing some amount of good. In comparison, by doing nothing, we are at best amorally standing by while actions are being taken with no regard for the potential ethical concerns raised thereby. By extending rights to animals, even unnecessarily, we force humans to consider their actions and to develop a finer, as opposed to a more callous, regard towards fellow living creatures (including other humans). By not so doing, we invite humans to consider to think of other living creatures as mere machines disposable at one's leisure, a line of thought prevalent amongst psychopaths. (  http://en.wikipedia.org...   )This concern, of raising moral awareness and enhancing empathy, has been addressed by past philosophers and ethicists as noted here:   http://en.wikipedia.org...   .  \n  \r\nHaving shown that there are at least three legitimate reasons for extending rights to animals, I believe that my opponent's resolution has been disproven. I would note that the animal rights movement does not necessitate rights equal to human beings being extended, nor does it require the extension of such rights to all animals, as noted in the Wikipedia article. Of course, my opponent appears to be using the PETA definition of animal rights, which extends the scope of animal rights efforts considerably. Regardless, I believe the afore-mentioned justifications still apply even to PETA's version of animal rights, in so far as that by indoctrinating others to be needlessly deferential towards other life forms you necessarily cause them to be at least appropriately concerned for the welfare of others.  \n  \r\nI therefore turn this debate over to my opponent and await the argument in support of his resolution.", "category": "Society", "round": 0, "debate_id": "Animal-rights-is-an-unjustified-ethical-doctrine./1/", "idx": 5040}
