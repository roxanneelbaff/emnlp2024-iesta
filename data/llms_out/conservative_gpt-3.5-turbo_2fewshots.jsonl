Although it was not dealt with well the first time, we have evolved our technology and veterinary abilities 2. If we regulated the adoption, care, and quarantined imported and exotic animals to give them blood testing, we could reduce the assumed disease rate and emotional problems that animals can acquire coming into a new environment. 3.

Really ? what are you doing writing the great American novel ? Con says \"However, I would like to point out that Pro still has not fulfilled his burden of proof in showing that the Penal Substitution Atonement that he is objecting to is actually the way the Bible presents the function of the death of Christ on the Cross\" What the hell ? Why is Con just making stuff up, my arguments were never based on whether the bible presents a substitution atonement, I present my own objections INDEPENDENTLY of what the bible does or does not say. I ask Con to acknoweldge my objections exist on their own merits and not what the bible says or doesn't say. Con brings up the \"Christius Victor\" , and claim that I have to refute this other wise they win be default. When setting up this debate I had said \"I as the Pro in this debate will be raising objections to the belief that \"Jesus died\" for our sins. My opponent as the Con will defend against my objections\" I raised my objections, I defeated Con counter arguments, now they are trying to shift even more of a burden unto me, by demanding that I refute every single claim made in the name of atonement. Did I present reasons why Jesus dying our sins is objectionable? yes I did Was Con able to show these objections were false and or unwarranted ? no Does this support my claim that Jesus for our sins is objectionable ?, yup. So Con, Is this the best you got ? trying to move the goal posts ? shifting the burden of proof ? If that's the best you got for defending that Jesus died for our sins..................... Con might have a technical point here, but I made this debate assuming that the debate would be taken in good faith, considering the Con would be defending the claim Jesus died for your sins. Even at the start of the debate I had said \"Elaboration on what it means that \"Jesus died for our/your sins\" I don't want to give a detailed atonement theory, so hopefully the basics will suffice which are........ 1) Everyone is a sinner 2) Sinners deserve punishment (usually refereed to as eternity in hell, either burning in fire and or separation from God in darkness 3) Jesus wrongful death by crucifixion is necessary for God to forgive sinners\" Clearly Con new what I had in mind because previously they had said \"This view is called Penal Substitution/Satisfaction and is the leading and historically orthodox view of the Attonement\" Con did try to defend against my objections (see round 1), at which point I showed why their defense was false (see round 2), now that they lost that argument, they try to shift the burden unto me, by claiming unless I prove all atonement theories false, they win by default. Really, is this what you have to resort too ? Con has not being able to prove my objections that Jesus dying for our sins is false, or unreasonable or without warrant.

If the judge feels that you did a happy dance well because it made them happy then they might give a '7' not a '6' just out of their mood that day. Now, although it's true to say that judges often can share opinions what you'll often find is that on shows like \"Strictly Come Dancing\" in the UK, the four, equally trained and experienced, judges give different numbers each time. It is VERY VERY rare to have four of the same numbers ranked out of 10 and thus shows that, unlike any sport, dancing is judged based on opinion, not true record."}, {"effective_argument": "A better definition of deism would be a belief in God based on reason. Some deists believe that God intervenes in the universe. In fact, there is a wide spectrum of deists from Christian (or quasi-Christian) to agnostic deists, even deist anti-theists who criticize religion as strongly as some atheists. Hence, it's best to capture all deists as people who belief in God based on reason and outside the scope of organised religions. Deism has evolved from the quasi-Christian movement it was to something larger. Your point on deism's absurdity rests on the proposal that deism involves a belief that denies itself (a belief that believes it doesn't matter). You state the reason for this is because deists believe in a God who doesn't care whether or not He is believed in. This is wrong because 1) Believing your belief doesn't matter isn't absurd; what is absurd (or logically contradictory) is to believe you don't have a belief. Na\"ve skeptics are an example of this, atheists too. Examples of people who think their beliefs don't matter include Unitarian universalists (who accept all beliefs), liberal Christians (who believe other faiths are as valid as theirs), Bahai followers who think the brotherhood of all men is more important. 2) Even then, not all deists think God doesn't care about someone's belief. Some may think God cares and it seems Edward Herbert was that sort. Some are agnostic about it, and some do think God doesn't care. Your statement that deists believe God doesn't care is a hasty generalization, especially since deism has been a loose movement for centuries, even till now. 3) Finally, what if God doesn't care ? How must it follow that deism undermines itself ? Christians say the Bible teaches that they shouldn't care for secular matters but spiritual ones; does it follow that Christians undermine themselves ? It doesn't. No more than a painter who doesn't care whether people like his painting or not makes him less a painter. I think a Yahweh who is omniscient would have foreseen atheists and deists and couldn't (and shouldn't IMHO) be bothered with them. Even then, I can argue that Yahweh didn't care about deists or atheists, and undermined himself since there is no mention of deists, and atheism is mentioned once in Psalm 14:1.

Many, many Atheists come into this debate with the ideas that: 1) They want their Chstian opponent to argue scientifically, not Bibically 2) Factual evidence should be found apart from the Christian God I say simply these cannot be the terms of the debate. As a creationist, I come into this debate with presuppositions, as do you.

Since I connot, in a fair and balanced debate, strip away your presuppositions, nor you mine, You must challenge my basis of thought. There is no such thing as \"bare facts\". If you strip away my presuppositions, then I am not able to make a alternative interpretation of facts.

Renzzy"}, {"effective_argument": "Thank you to my opponent for his response. To rebut: Pro is arguing that religion provides a better grounding for morality specifically through the lens of gay marriage. He points out that \"Forty years ago, you would barely find someone who believed in gay marriage as being right\". He says that like it is a good thing; I do not believe it was, and there are religious groups who agree. Since \"religion\" as a whole does not agree with Pro (nor could it, as it encompasses a huge swath of opinions), is Pro arguing that religion is a better grounding, or that his religion is a better grounding? And upon what grounds? Pro claims that \"religions will always have a set line that shouldn't be crossed\". I've already shown how that isn't the case; the examples I gave of religious groups that now accept gay marriage clearly changed their minds on the matter. Thus, religion is just as capable of having \"movable morals\". I remind Pro of the sheer number of laws in the Bible that call for the death penalty. Is he advocating as much for the death penalty to those who pick up sticks on the sabbath? Or a betrothed woman who doesn't shout loud enough when she's being raped? And even taken at face value, morals having no basis in rationality or possibility of change only make sense if you accept premises of religion that not everyone accepts, such as the moral perfection of the lawgiver. If that isn't presumed, then what you potentially have are WRONG moral prescripts that are unchangeable. Is it Pro's position better to have wrong morals so long as they don't change? Pro goes on to say that the bible speaks against homosexuality. He gives no grounds why that's a good thing, instead appealing to a \"slippery slope\" when he asks us to \"imagine what will be allowed by society movable morality [sic] in the next few decades.\" Pro has not established why an \"immovable morality\" is inherently better than a movable one. I would argue that, indeed, it is not. Arguments about the \"immovable morality\" of the bible were used to justify slavery, until society's \"movable morals\" let us see how wrong it was. Pro closes with two false equivalencies: \"Religions= non movable lines of morality that shouldn't be crossed. Right is right and wrong is wrong.\" As previously noted, I have showed this as both not inherently true, and not necessarily a good thing even if it is. \"Secular= movable lines of morality. Right is right and wrong can also be right. This leaves no room for wrong.\" This is a straw man argument. Secular morality is not inherently nihilistic. Secular morality requires the application of reason to moral arguments. Morality that never changes is only good if you already presuppose that it is perfect. Absent that presupposition, you run the risk of enshrining wrong morals forever, if you accept Pro's already-shown-to-be-fallacious argument that religious morality never changes. Pro has given no reason for us to think that gay marriage is wrong, or that homosexuality is immoral, but he claims that society's acceptance of those things makes his view of religion better, because it hasn't changed. The same argument could be applied to slavery, to the murder of those of other faiths, and to acceptance of rape (as long as you try to marry the victim). This is not intended as an attack on the bible, per se, but rather to point out that Pro's view on the immobility of morality is dramatically flawed.

This being said, hello Daniel's cousin. May I ask your real name please? Oh, how rude, my name is Eli and I live in America. It's surprising that I've never heard of you from LM. We've debated several times and subsequently had several conversations concerning his debating career and he has never mentioned someone who was a BETTER debater than he. I would also extend my thanks to LM for translating this debate for me. As for the illiterate, I would like to invite you to the debate but forewarn Daniel that if anyone else types even one letter on this debate, Webmaster is within his rights to tear down your account. But being that neither of the debaters I am currently debating can read English, that should be no problem. Also, my opponent has done a good job of maintaining my rules. I would also like to say I am debating contentions to be brought up at any time. If you, being one of my two (perhaps more), opponents would like to bring up a new contention at any point, that is fine. \"I'd rather not think about any of the popular Internet memes at the moment if that is okay with both Daniel and my opponent. Hopefully, this debate doesn't revolve around them.\" It does. The Game. But that's actually not important right now. My opponent will lose this debate. That may sound arrogant but he has already lost insofar as Daniel was required to read every word out to his cousin. My opponent is not truly Daniel's cousin is it? It seems my opponent as dictated by debate.org is Logical-Master whose true name is Daniel. I am debating Daniel. Therefore, Daniel must address me as Daniel, not as a medium for any other debater. In such a case, I am awaiting my opponent's case. This is currently my only contention but is subject to change. I would also like to add one more thing: While contentions can be made at any round, my opponent cannot post any comments about the debate after they have posted a Round 1. I don't know if this matters to you but anything written before my Round 2 response gets posted is acceptable. I await your response, EG"}, {"effective_argument": "\"That's just a blatant...get it over with.\" Pro isn't even addressing the right attack. The reason that was being referred to was Pro's claim that because South Korea did nothing wrong, they should just have sex. As this refutation fails to address the claim, it should be disregarded. \"Me and my right hand have... NEVER faced any kind of interpersonal relation problems.\" The hand is part of Pro's own body, and has no consciousness of its own, and therefore is not capable of having interpersonal relation problems. The Koreas, however, are separate entities with thoughts of their own, so this is a faulty comparison. Also, North Korea, like most women, wants a relationship, and if they just had sex, she would get frustrated with the arrangement, which would only lead to more drama (1). \"We need to talk\" That is not the sort of communication that was being referred to. Talking here was simply referring to the normal conversation that would happen on their dates, not the dreaded \"talk.\" \" You think she's going to change... evidence suggests that is not the case. I would like to ask Pro what evidence he is referring to, as no evidence has been presented to show that North Korea would not change. \"England f*cked the US... its normal for that to happen. The apathy of the other countries for this situation was not a result of it being normal, but of England being a cougar. When an older male f*cks a kid, it's creepy, but when a cougar f*cks a kid, people just say \"Nice\" and move on (2). Also, there was a huge age difference, and America had not yet learned how to say, \"No, I'm not ready,\" or how to say many other words, as he was still only two. Also, Pro's refutation failed to address the low maturity levels of the Koreas. \"They are ready to... open to the idea.\" North Korea is not open to the idea, as evidenced by her lack of willingness to screw South Korea. As stated before, if she wanted sex, she could have gotten it a long time ago. Pro claimed in a previous argument that North Korea is the assertive one, and that South Korea is not. If the sex were to happen, North Korea would have to be the instigator, and she is not ready. \"Practice makes perfect... Or babies if you don't use protection.\" Due to their lack of sex education (See Round 2 \"Inexperience\"), they don't even know what protection is. On top of that, as evidenced by her mood swings last month (3) and the extended biological cycles that countries seem to have as compared to humans, she is in the perfect time in her menstrual cycle for baby-making (4). As they have no knowledge of protection and she is at the perfect time for baby-making, if they just had sex and got it over with, North Korea would get pregnant and a baby would be born, which Pro says would \"come out all f*cked up,\" so they should not just get it over with. \"HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET LAID\" South isn't man enough to be assertive, North has him whipped, and she isn't ready, so the only way he will make her ready is through romance. \"They are best... can't stop thinking of each other.\" Opinion, yes, but it was directly quoted from Pro's first argument. \"Their close proximity... Opinion.\" Already addressed. If North Korea wanted sex, she could have gotten it\" As she has the body, the assertive personality, and South Korea is whipped, it should still be considered true that she could have gotten sex a long time ago if she wanted it. In conclusion, North Korea and South Korea would be better off pursuing a romantic relationship than just having sex and getting it over with already. Please vote Con. Sources: 1. <URL>... 2.

{"basic": "Argument: \"Do you want your society being polluted by the utter disturbance from cigarettes?\"\n\nResponse: I understand your concern about the impact of cigarettes on society. However, I would like to explore this issue further to gain a better understanding. Could you please provide specific examples of the pollution and disturbance caused by cigarettes that you are referring to?\n\n\"In the United Kingdom...\"\n\nIn response to your statement about the United Kingdom, I would like to address a few points. Firstly, I agree that children should not smoke, and it is important to educate them about the dangers of smoking. Secondly, it is worth noting that cigarette vending machines have been removed from bars (pubs) in my area for at least 10 years. Lastly, I question the effectiveness of removing vending machines from bars in reducing underage smoking, as one must be of legal age to enter a bar, which is higher than the legal smoking age.\n\n\"Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said: 'It's vital we get across the message to children that smoking is bad. If that means stripping out vending machines or removing cigarettes from behind the counter, I'm willing to do that.'\"\n\nWhen the government or any entity starts discussing measures like this, two thoughts come to mind. Firstly, I believe that it is the responsibility of parents and other individuals, rather than the government, to provide education about smoking. Secondly, it is important to recognize that complete elimination of \"bad behavior\" such as children smoking is not feasible. Children often do what they want, regardless of adult instruction or potential punishment. Additionally, I do not believe that the visibility of cigarettes for sale is the primary motivator for anyone, including children, to smoke. It is more likely that children who smoke are influenced by observing adults smoking and wanting to appear more mature or \"cool.\"\n\n\"The fact of influencing children is another major for the ban of cigarettes being displayed.\"\n\nI apologize, but I am having difficulty understanding the meaning of this sentence. Could you please clarify your point in a more concise manner?\n\n\"She added: 'Children who smoke are putting their lives at risk and are more likely to die of cancer than people who start smoking later.'\"\n\nI agree that children who smoke are at a higher risk of health issues, including cancer. However, it is important to note that I am not arguing in favor of children smoking.\n\n\"Measures that make it easier to sell nicotine replacement gums and patches are also being considered.\"\n\nWhile this information is relevant, I fail to see how it directly supports the argument for banning the display of cigarettes. Could you please explain the connection between these measures and the impact on children's smoking habits?\n\n\"Children who are confronted with cigarettes in their local shops are more than likely to pick up the habit of this kind of behavior being ok, thus leading to youth smokers in our community.\"\n\nI understand your concern about children being influenced by the presence of cigarettes in local shops. However, I would like to see evidence that supports the claim that the display of cigarettes behind a counter at a convenience store has a significant impact on a child's decision to start smoking. It is important to consider other factors such as peer pressure and exposure to adults smoking, which may have a more significant influence on a child's decision to smoke.\n\n\"Tell me, do you want your child to suffer?\"\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I do not have any children.

I'll try to avoid all references to the Terminator along the way. Quick definitions: Drone - unmanned aircraft owned by the United States Insurgent - anybody deemed by the United States to be an \"insurgent\" I am limiting this debate to the United States because no other country uses drones as much as they do (so far as we know) To justify this case, I will present four main contentions. To win this debate, my opponent needs to show that each of these four contentions is false, and that there is at least one good reason why drones are superior to foot soldiers. 1) They are prone to failing. Osama Bin Laden stated that the main reason he was able to hold his position at Tora Bora was because drones do not target underground, which is where his fighters were hiding. Drones are highly likely to crash, costing millions of dollars [1]. They are also ineffective at killing those whom they are designed to kill - on average for every one militant killed, so are at least ten civilians [2]. On another occasion, a counter-insurgency adviser to General David Petraeus said that about 98% of the deaths were civilians [3]. This is because drone pilots are more likely to ignore civilians, children and innocents when carrying out their operations, as they don't need to deal with it themselves [4]. These pilots also tend to see the situation more as a video game [5] and have less collective morale [6]. The point is that the war is not without cost, it is simply that it is another race of people we are shifting the cost on to (Pakistanis, Iraqis) although they don't deserve it (as Peter Singer demonstrates in his excellent book \"Wired for War\"). 2) The United States needs the cooperation of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq to carry out their operations successfully - otherwise the entire country will decide to start hating the United States and thus become insurgents. These are largely tribal countries, where bravery is an important virtue. The cowardice of drone strikes, coupled with the large civilian killings, breeds public disgust. Therefore using drones exclusively will not solve the problem of terrorism, rather make it worse[7]. Further, surgical precise killings of a few critical positions, as drones offer, do not actually harm the movement at all. New leaders simply come along. The problem is the supply lines, and these cannot be dealt with from the air - ground personnel are needed! Remember what happened after we killed al-Zarqawi in 2006 [8]? 3) The lack of percieved risk may cause certain governments to start wars more frequently [6]. Using drones often will make it seem like you don't need to risk people's lives to go to war - and thus governments will attempt to impose their will on others whenever they want. God help me if New Zealand is caught in the crossfire! Actually lives will be lost, whether it be in the aggressor's country or the defender's. Who knows - maybe enemy drones would prove more effective than yours. 4) Their legality is, at best, questionable [9]. They appear to ignore the Geneva convention as they do not differentiate between civilians and soldiers. There is no specific law allowing their use in warfare. When the CIA tried to kill Baitullah Mehsud using drones, the drones took the lives of between 207 and 321 civilians before, fourteen months and two plane crashes later, Mehsud was found and killed. Properly trained and equipped, an elite unit would have been able to achieve the same effect without the civilian casualties and at a lower cost. I'm all for not risking lives in battle, but drones take more lives than ground fighting. They're a dangerous precedent, they won't work and they're illegal.

This factual flaw in Con's argument means that he has not taken into account the catastrophic effects of a global flood before refuting it, making his argument factually flawed. Additionally, this flaw also renders Con's argument logically flawed.\n\nMoving on to the topic of the human race, my opponent's argument hinges on the assumption that Noah was a Jew. I have clearly shown that this assumption is false. Therefore, this argument is logically invalid and factually flawed. Furthermore, I feel morally justified in bringing in new information in response to my opponent's new information. The concept of the human race is biologically unsound, as evidenced by the fact that any two unrelated human beings differ by about 3 million distinct DNA variants. The majority of human variation, about 85%, is found within local populations, rather than between different races. This further undermines the idea of race as a valid biological concept.\n\nRegarding Con's arguments about saltwater fish, they rely on the reader not being aware of outside facts. However, it is well-known that large aquariums often have both freshwater and saltwater fish living in the same tank. This fact undermines Con's argument and renders it factually flawed.\n\nI have chosen not to address the issue of evolution being too slow, as it is not relevant to the current debate. Additionally, Con's arguments in this regard can be considered non-arguments, as they are merely skeptical questionnaires that do not contribute to the debate.\n\nMoving on to the topic of geology, my opponent has committed the grave offense of ignoring the argument. I have already provided a detailed explanation of this phenomenon, which Con has chosen to ignore. It is important in a debate to respond to arguments, and Con's failure to do so is a poor debating practice.\n\nFurthermore, Con's rebuttals rely on quotations from WordPress blogs, rather than directly quoting the scientists themselves. This reliance on secondary sources undermines the credibility of Con's arguments. Additionally, Con has once again ignored the evidence I presented, choosing to disregard it rather than engage with it. This further weakens his position.\n\nLastly, regarding the issue of Mt. Everest fossils, I would direct readers to my debate with Roy, along with the comments, for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\nIn conclusion, my opponent has made several errors throughout this debate. He has ignored arguments, made factual and logical errors, used unreliable sources, and relied on blog news as sources. These conduct violations should be taken into consideration when voting.

That's fair enough if you see a criminal, you can presume they are a bad person but study this: If a person swears, does it makes them bad? If a person kills someone, does it make them bad? What is the difference between the to and why would the killing one, change peoples view on the person and not the swearing, unless it's consistent? Also, motives. If someone hurt someone by accident, they have still created the same outcome as if they did it on purpose. Therefore, are they judged as bad? People could presume they did it on purpose and call them bad but if they truly know it was an accident, they would be more lenient. Say Manslaughter. It's the same outcome as murder but the person is judged more leniently. I'm here to argue that \"bad people\" may have reasons. Reasons are important in judging whether someone is good or bad. If someone has been good all their life and they get immensely stressed one day and freak out, ( see the film \"falling down\" ) they do bad things in their anger, and people who only see them doing the bad will presume they are a bad person even though all their life they have been a very good person.

This means that he is not quoting from the scientists themselves. Basically, he relies on a source which quotes Faux, not Faux\u2019s own words. Furthermore, Con has once again ignored the evidence I presented, preferring that readers ignore it with him. I will not cite the   vast evidence for my case   again.   Con has basically used a source ([13]) as his argument. If he wants to make an argument, he\u2019d   better   write it out.   Mt. Everest fossils  : Like Con said, read my debate with Roy. Along with the comments.   In Conclusion  : Con has made the following errors:  1. Con has   ignored the argument  .  2. Con has made both   factual and logical errors  .  3. Con has used a   source as an argument  .  4. Con uses   blog news as sources  . This means that   his sources is unreliable and should be discarded   despite being more numerous.   With all of these conduct violations, I would strongly urge the voters to be cautious in their voting. I will most certainly be heavily criticising any RFD that is insufficient.   1.   http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org...", "category": "Science", "round": 3, "debate_id": "The-Great-Flood-Was-an-Actual-Historical-Event/1/", "idx": 59808}
{"basic": "Argument: Implementing Pro's proposal would lead to higher costs for companies. This raises the question of how these costs will be covered. The most likely scenario is that companies will reduce worker wages in order to compensate for the increased expenses. However, when worker wages are lowered, individuals have less disposable income, resulting in reduced consumer spending. As a consequence, businesses will not generate as much revenue. This loss of revenue may force them to lay off employees or further decrease wages, creating a vicious cycle that ultimately disrupts the entire system. It is clear that following Pro's suggestion would have detrimental effects. Additionally, Pro has failed to provide any compelling reasons for pursuing alternative energy sources or explain why carbon is inherently bad.

The bar is pretty low and as I have shown in round 1: \"an agnostic atheist\" is an atheist in some sense, so my opponent's resolution is negated. That alone should merit voting in my favor. However, in this round I will offer more rebuttals of my opponent's claims, which I hope will solidify the win. Pro : \"What most theories of knowledge purport knowledge to be is namely, a justified true 'belief.'\" Response : I believe my opponent is referring to the tripartite theory of knowledge [1], but that theory has been refuted by Gettier cases [2] which show that some justified true beliefs do not constitute knowledge. Furthermore, I would posit that knowledge might be better defined as the \"mental grasp of the facts of reality.\" [3] Thus, there is a distinction between knowledge and belief, which was also demonstrated in the table which I presented in Round 1. Pro: \"In simple prose, gnosticism is logically equivalent to saying 'I can know.' While agnosticism is logically equivalent to saying 'I cannot know.' The former affirms knowledge, the latter denies knowledge.\" Response: Since I have shown that knowledge and belief are different, the above statement from my opponent actually reaffirms my position. Therefore, I would refer my opponent back to the chart from round 1 to show how the terms \"agnostic\" and \"atheist\" can be conflated together without redefining atheism. My opponent's remaining argument is based on the false assumption that knowledge is a justified belief and is subsequently not sound. Even my opponent's own source ( <URL>... ) clearly supports my position: \"'Agnostic' is more contextual than is 'atheist', as it can be used in a non-theological way, as when a cosmologist might say that she is agnostic about string theory, neither believing nor disbelieving it.\" Again, this demonstrates that atheism is a term that is used in a theological context, whereas agnosticism can be applied to various contexts. When applied to the theological context, it can be conflated with the term theism or atheism without redefining either one. Pro: \"Rather an atheist must justify his \"God doesn't exist\" claim by showing somehow that God, in fact, does not exist.\" Response: If we're talking about a Gnostic Atheist, then yes, the she would have to show that god does not exist. However, if we're talking about an Agnostic Atheist, then it is not necessary to justify non-belief in god. This is a good example why such a distinction is necessary and the conflation of the two terms actually provides that distinction. Pro: \"My opponent does this by claiming, again, mistakingly, that atheism is a lack of belief, not the denial of a belief. The difference is subtle yet important if any fair discussion is going to commence between both parties.\" Response: I think that the distinction is not necessarily relevant to the resolution of this debate, as I have already demonstrated that the two terms can be conflated together without changing the definition of atheism. The distinction is indeed subtle and I don't particularly have an objection to the use of either definition. Pro: \"This subtly, when closely examined, becomes a fundamental double standard, striking any honest seeker of truth with vagueness and dishonesty right out of the gates.\" Response: The only seeker of truth that finds such distinction dishonest is one that has incorrectly understood knowledge to be the same as belief, as my opponent seems to have done. The burden of proof is on the person that's taking the affirmative position and claiming otherwise would be truly dishonest. I have not sidestepped anything and it should be rather clear that a Gnostic Atheist has the same burden of proof as a Gnostic Theist. However, it is also true that neither an Agnostic Theist nor an Agnostic Atheist have the burden of proof, since they're the default position with respect to the positive claims of their Gnostic counterparts. Reductio ad Absurdum If my opponent's position is true, then it should make sense in another context: if my opponent believes that Big Foot does not exist , then my opponent would have to provide justification for that belief. More importantly, my opponent would also have the burden of proof that Big Foot does not exist . Indeed, this notion is absurd and it clearly demonstrates that Pro's position would hold true even in absurd cases. You can replace Big Foot with numerous other absurdities and you would end up violating a central philosophical concept. However, with the definitions I've provided, we can clearly identify where the burden of proof rests and it's always on the party which takes the affirmative position. Conclusion Again, I would like to point out that I have already negated my opponent's resolution, because I've shown that there is a definition out there which conflates Atheism and Agnosticism and it is Atheism in some sense: that alone should be sufficient to win this debate. If we assume that my opponent's argument is true, then we would have to do away with the fundamental philosophical concept which states that the burden of proof rests on the position asserting a claim. I have also demonstrated that Pro has reached several conclusions based on the false premise that knowledge is defined as a justified belief, therefore making my opponent's argument unsound. The differences gained by the use of the terms gnostic/agnostic allow us to correctly place the burden of proof on a person taking the affirmative position and not on the critic. [1] <URL>...

{"basic": "The argument that turning 18 only grants a few privileges such as getting a license, entering a club, and voting, while still denying other privileges for good reasons, is a valid point. One of the reasons for denying certain privileges, such as the ability to drink alcohol, is that the liver is not fully developed at 18. Additionally, many teenagers lack the knowledge and maturity to handle alcohol responsibly. It is concerning that some teenagers view being drunk as \"cool\" and engage in reckless behavior as a result. The high number of car accidents and fights caused by drunk individuals further supports the argument against early alcohol consumption. While some countries, like Portugal, have a lower drinking age, the behavior of teenagers in those countries is often beligerent and focused solely on drinking and smoking. This leads to numerous accidents, particularly due to drunk driving. It is important to consider the consequences of adding alcohol to the list of dangers that teenagers already face, such as drugs and fights, which unfortunately result in many deaths.", "len_basic": 1087, "len_orig": 1090, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "Good afternoon, I'm delighted to join this debate. Background Checks Let me start my rebuttal by discussing the role of background checks. The so called 40% loophole is very far from the truth. Any Gun Store that participates in a gun show is still operating as a business, and therefore required to conduct the Federally Required Background Check. What people are referring to are gun sales/transfers between private individuals. Does this occur? Of course it does. Every minute of every day someone is purchasing/transferring/gifting a firearm from someone without a background check. The response to this \"problem\" is the so called Universal Background Check. The problem with this solution is, how could it possibly be enforced? A gun store is easy because they must register with the government in order to operate as a business. The Government knows where it is, what paperwork that must kept for auditing, employee background checks, etc. A gun show would be easy as well because they advertise for months the location. Law enforcement could easily oversee such an event. But what about between private individuals? Every minute of every day people manufacture, transport, sell, and consume illegal narcotics despite both State and Federal Laws. How would laws on the transfer of firearms be any different? Since it cannot be enforced it would be a waste of taxpayer time and money to create the law, and a waste on law enforcement to enforce it. But then again, waste has never been a concern for the government ;) 90% of Americans want background checks! This will be more of my critical thinking than one of absolute fact. Whenever I hear 90% of Americans want background checks, several things go through my mind. 1) Was all of America polled? - There are over 180 million registered voters in the US. Each poll taken have an average of <PHONE> responses. 2) Where was the poll? - It's extremely difficult to find truly neutral ground to conduct a poll. A poll on MSNBC will have a different outcome than one created by FOX. 3) When was the last time 90% of Americans agreed on ANYTHING? - There is no question that the US is more divided now than at any other time since the Civil War. To claim that 90% of Americans agree on something, especially something as controversial as gun control, is very suspicious to me. Why can't we be like the UK? It's true, the UK/Japan/Australia/ETC have lower gun violence/gun death rates than the US. Did they achieve this by enacting Universal Background checks? No. Did they achieve this by banning \"Assault\" weapons? No. Did they achieve this by limiting the number of firearms any single individual can own? No. They achieved it by banning ALL firearms. A total ban is the only way to have a total reduction in the number of gun deaths and the number of gun crimes. Several prominent activist groups and people have expressed their desire for a total gun ban, but they are just as extreme as the people who demand their right to own a F22. The majority of people in the US do NOT advocate a total firearm ban. So until we have a majority and ban all firearms, we will never be like the UK/Australia/Japan. We register our Cars, why not our Guns? We arrive in what I refer to as \"The Grey Zone\". The mysterious and deadly zone of confusion, misinterpretation, and downright ignorance. Do we register our cars because we own them? No. We register them because we DRIVE them. There is no law that requires your vehicle be registered if it is to remain on private property. They are required to be registered in order to drive them on PUBLIC roads. But here is the crucial element that divides the PRO Gun side and the PRO Gun Control side - Driving a car on PUBLIC roads is NOT a right. You, nor I, nor anyone, has the right to drive a car. In order to exercise this PRIVILEGE you have to agree to abide by the rules, laws, and regulations of that privilege. Owning a Firearm, however, is a right. It was a right before the US was created, and will continue to be a right long after the US is gone. The Government is NOT after your guns you crazies!!! No part of the gun control debate is as toxic, ruins relationships, and gets you on a \"watch\" list more than the idea that the 2nd Amendment was written as a reminder that the Citizens have the right to own ARMS in order to use them against our own government. Here's the thing, that's EXACTLY what the 2nd Amendment was written for. The PRO Gun Control side argues that the 2nd Amendment was written to protect hunting. But in 1776 the right to hunt was obvious to all Founders that it was not needed to be written down. Why? If you didn't hunt, you didn't eat. The Pro Gun Control side argues that the 2nd Amendment was written so that the US could protect itself from outside nations and internal threats such as native american attacks. But if you keep reading the Constitution it clearly states that the Government has the authority to raise armies to protect the homeland. Why state the same thing twice? Redundancies are one thing, inefficiency is another. The 13 States had just won a brutal and bloody war of Secession by using their firearms against their own government. Our Founders knew that the natural order of Government is to grow, consume, and become tyrannical until the next revolution. Our Founders had ZERO faith in the government they had just created. That is why there is a Bill of Rights."}, {"effective_argument": "First of all, let me thank Pro for this open invitation and agree with Pro that not only is this a very intriguing topic but that I myself would love for it to be the case. Sadly the scientific basis for this is rather lacking, however I might personally feel about it. Pro has referred to two different phenomena in making the case for this idea. The first, biophotons, refers simply to the idea that the human body emits light. Cellular metabolism releases energy - this energy can disperse as heat or in the form of 'packets' known as photons of light. It has been postulated that biophotons are involved in cellular communication. Not only is this in contention, but as Pro has already stated, humans cannot sense the photons involved in human biophotonics. I must further add that as far as is currently known, humans also do not have the capacity to directly affect cellular metabolism and thus do not have the ability to control their own biophotonics by anything other than the most basic and crude means (by for example working out or bludgeoning themselves to cause trauma). ( <URL>... ). Separate to this, the human body has a measurable magnetic field that is nothing to do with the extremely faint ferromagnetic properties of our blood - our nervous system produces current, therefore a field is generated. That does interact with the global magnetic field, but the general scientific consensus is that the external global field has no measurable effect on us, or our behaviour. We do possess the genetic hardware to sense magnetic fields, but crucially for some reason our species doesn't activate it ( <URL>... ) ( <URL>... ). However, even if activated the consensus is that it works in animals with the sense by making the normal vision appear lighter or darker depending on which way they turn. This in no way implies that they can sense the small local fluctuations of magnetic field. Moreover, we lack any capacity to see this ourselves, or a means extend any control over the global field. Perhaps in the future someone might work out how to re-activate this dormant capacity, but it will be a visual and directional sense, and a sense rather than a capacity to alter behaviour. In support of my previous statement, I note that the World Health Organisation states that to the best of it's knowledge through the examination of various studies, low-level magnetic fields do not have any health consequences on humans in either a physiological or psychological capacity ( <URL>... ). Some enthusiasts have even gone so far as to compensate for the lack of this sense by creating implants to sense magnetic fields using neodymium discs. ( <URL>... ) Crucially, 1) Would they have done so if they already had the capacity to be aware of the fields involved, and 2) Do you, or I, notice the significantly-more-powerful-than-the-human-body's magnetic field when we walk out the store past the anti-theft gateway? The answer of course is no. To conclude, the human mind cannot detect electromagnetic fields without technological assistance, nor recognise them. It is possible (though contested) that the human mind may, with a great deal of conscious effort, be able to manipulate their own personal magnetic field through concentration in a specific body part. Biofeedback training may help in this endeavour, but ultimately, since few of us even notice when we pass through/under EM fields on a daily basis, whilst influence may be possible, notable effect is not."}], "ideology": "The transition to adulthood at the age of 18 brings about certain privileges, such as obtaining a driver's license, entering clubs, and being able to vote.

It's been fun! 1. Pro's disregard for implicit parameters of the resolution is disappointing, especially in light of his opening plea for a straightforward debate. The theory of branching timelines and the non-disturbance clause of the paradox, which states that no problem occurs unless the creation of the time machine is prevented, are logically sound [1]. Demands for greater certainty are unreasonable considering the imaginary nature of the paradox. These counter-arguments are plausible, have garnered no disproof from Pro, and render null the paradox. As for \"side stepping\" this argument, my initial negation addressed the central issue of this contention: its inappropriateness. Given the character limit, the space I've afforded this non-issue has been generous. 2. Pro's source lists volatile factors present before the war, but fails to address Hitler's connection to each. Tense foreign relations and disputed treaties mean nothing without a violent leader willing to break international laws and invade countries. Despite claiming that \"another bitter leader\" would suffice, Pro has failed to even hint at a group or individual with the opportunity, means, and desire to take steps toward genocide in Hitler's stead. Hitler's oratory skills and military insight transformed the defunct Nazi party into the leading political power in Germany [2]. Had it not been for this driving force, the country's path would have been different. Their military was in ruins, the League of Nations was sympathetic to their turmoil, and Europe had no plans for combat [3, see: Hitler's Foreign Policy]. Also, Germany's nuclear program was reactivated on Hitler's orders [4, see: 1st & 2nd Uranverein], eliminating the likelihood of nuclear war without him. 3. Pro has conceded this point. 4. My rebuttal here was clear. Hitler's removal almost certainly amounts to a net gain for the resulting timeline, so a premium placed on lives favors the Con position. Misgivings about power-wielding are baseless without equally probable evidence to the contrary, which has not been provided. Avoidance of my response is tantamount to concession. ::Closing:: Hitler birthed the Nazi party and instigated nearly 50 million deaths. Still, Pro argues that in his absence, a wiser, equally bigoted soldier with equivalent skills in foreign policy, military tactics, and propaganda would not only perform similar enough actions to start a war, but also do a superior job and cause more destruction! This outlandish belief fails in the face of the sureness with which Hitler's death would be a good idea. ::References:: 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>..."}], "ideology": "I must admit defeat to my opponent in this debate.

Matter in fact, FNC has such a bad reputation that even FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting) and Media Matters has deemed them to be the most biased name in news. <URL>... The president of the FNC is none other than Roger Ailes who severed as a political consultant for man republican candidates during the 1960's, 70's, and 80's including Richard M. Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Roger was placed in charge of Fox by a very conservative man by the name of Rupert Murdoch who had a child like love for Ronald Reagan. But enough with the background information, let me show you some of the overwhelming physical evidence of Fox News's countless tyranny of providing unfair and unbalanced news to the American people. <URL>... -In this article Newsweek makes a small review of Fox's textbook biasness.

You see every single Fox anchor has a boiling point for when they interview people. Naturally you figure that its just human to get angry when somebody tarnishes your viewpoint. However these beloved and sacred values each anchor has are ALL THE SAME. Meaning if a \"liberal\" guest on the show makes an accusation that would ither hurt or question the GOP's reputation; you will begin to see sparks fly amongst the anchors eyes. Granted in this example, a substitute was the one spitting the ad-hominids this time by usually those who aware of fox know the kings of this bully tactic would be Hannity and Oreilly. Sean Hannity like the majority of Fox anchors usually bullies the interviewee by asking loaded questions and keeping a less hostile approach.. Oreilly on the other hand isn't exactly afraid of getting his hands dirty. And by this, you will frequently see his hand gestures, his absurd accusations and his always great comparisons. (Like the time he compared gays to Al-qaeda...yeah that actually happened) <URL>... On this link you will find loads more information of fox's biasness and misleading arguments. In conclusion, I would like to just summarize the true evil aspect of this whole situation.. You see Fox \"news\", isn't really news. It's propaganda. And not even Conservative Propaganda, nope. It's Republican propaganda. And the reason I want to make the distinction is because I think it's important to recognize how Fox news really has well...raped conservatism.. Because Fox publicizes whatever the GOP spits out, by this transforming the ideal platforms of conservatism. The same goes for Msnbc, they do not represent liberalism, they represent the DNC and whatever they spit out. And by doing this compromising the ideals of true liberalism. The whole point of my little speech here is that we should recognize how horrible these news channels are.

The majority of people in the US are against homosexual marriages (1). Therefore, it does not follow that we should permit same-sex marriages. 2. It is reasonable to believe that homosexuality is sexual perversion. There is no evidenced gene, biological necessity, or evolutionary benefit for homosexuality. To accept my opponent's argument of \"innateness\" is to also accept, by logical necessity, pedophilia, zoophilia, and other sexual abnormalities. 3. Homosexuals have no more and no less rights than heterosexuals. The idea of any inequality existing in terms of rights is balderdash. Moreover, civil unions offer the same benefits of traditional marriages. Homosexuals are NOT segregated, nor are they given less rights. 4. By virtue of permitting individuals to marry partners of the same sex, marriage will quickly lose meaning and purpose. Who is to stop a man (or woman) from marrying, not just one, but two (or three) partners?

Both homosexuals AND heterosexuals have equal rights to marriage and civil unions. ----- \"The concept of 'separate but equal' has already failed. Segregation is not a solution when it comes to rights. History has proven this.\" To begin with, as was evidenced with proposition 8 in California, gay marriage is not a civil right. Also, there is absolutely no analogous connection between segregation and gay marriage. Homosexuals are given the exact same rights as everybody else - and they are most definitely not separated. ----- \"Secondly, where is the benefit of oppressing gays from marrying?\" Nobody is being oppressed. There are, however, plenty of negative repercussions. School sex-education programs would have to be entirely revamped to support equal say; it opens doors to polygamy and other such sexual aberrations; it is contra-popular vote. What are the benefits? They can have all the rights of marriage except for the name. A couple does not need marriage to be happy, comfortable, and free. ----- \"Those who claim it is immoral are really just ignorant and foolish.\" Everybody is ignorant of something, but it is not my ignorance and foolishness that you should be concerned with. Who are you to claim proprietary rights to what IS and IS NOT moral? How are you defining morality and by what objective source is it obtained? What makes your moral standards obligatory and trumping?

Under normal circumstances, people would look at that statement and say \"That doesn't make any sense at all.\" While many people still did that, many people took what he said as truth simply because he said it. Humans should not be viewed as having divine authority. Such a doctrine is morally negative. CONTENTION TWO: Protestantism was borne of some moral problems with Catholicism Catholicism was built largely on the Bible and other supposedly holy texts, where Protestantism was largely built on the qualms people had with Catholicism. EX: In the Bible, Jesus states that bread and wine are transformed into his flesh and blood in the eucharist. Catholicism takes this literally, but few other forms of Christianity do. Why? Because those other forms of Christianity found the idea of eating your savior's body to be morally repulsive. They're right. Claiming that the bread and wine really turn into flesh and blood of Jesus is not only a lie that doesn't have to be propagated, but it's also morally unsavory. The only form of morality that where eating Jesus' flesh and blood is admirable is a morality based specifically on the Catholic religion. There are no doubt many other moral qualms the protestants had when they split off from Catholicism. CONTENTION THREE: Catholicism is more ritualistic Catholicism has always kept their traditions running strong. Unfortunately, many of these traditions are very ritualistic. Rituals confuse people and stop people from thinking critically about issues - certainly not morally admirable. Closely related to the ritualistic nature of Catholicism is the \"saints.\" In Catholicism, saints are very important - in fact, most devout Catholics pray to certain saints. Prayer is very important in Catholicism, with catholics spending much more time praying and to all sorts of different folks. This distracts Catholics from issues that are more important - and that is not morally admirable. I would like to hear my opponent's theory on why Catholicism is morally superior to Protestantism."}], "ideology": "Although you have chosen not to continue this debate, I will refrain from presenting any further arguments in this round, in case you change your mind and wish to further discuss the points mentioned above.

{"basic": "Argument: It is important to be more specific when discussing the problems caused by sex before marriage in our modern society. Simply stating that it causes problems is not enough. We need to delve deeper and identify the specific issues that arise from this behavior. For example, we could explore how sex before marriage affects individual beliefs and values, or how it contributes to financial struggles and debt in our economy. It is also worth considering the impact on the duration of marriages and relationships, as some argue that sex before marriage can lead to shorter-lasting unions. However, it is unfair to solely blame sex before marriage for the state of society today. It is important to recognize that there are many factors at play. For instance, it is worth noting that pregnancy rates can increase even without sexual intercourse. Therefore, it is not accurate to attribute all societal issues to sex before marriage. We must acknowledge that society has evolved and changed, and it is not solely due to sexual behavior. If we are looking for something to blame, we should consider the role of technology. As technology has advanced, it has had a significant impact on the way we think and act. It has shaped our society in ways that go beyond sexual behavior. While I understand the point being made, I believe it is more accurate to attribute societal changes to technology rather than sex. Sex is a personal choice and what happens behind closed doors should stay private. Blaming sex for all the problems in the world oversimplifies the complex factors that contribute to societal issues.", "len_basic": 1613, "len_orig": 1627, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "I thank my opponent for his comments. The crime rate is what it is because deterrence works. Why then would the crime rate EVER increase as clearly MORE people are being incarcerated? [1] Shouldn't every single category of crime be consistently falling? I have already given reliable evidence for the effectiveness of deterrence, the Pro just refuses to acknowledge it. The same could be said. My opponent has completely ignored the fact that Norway's crime rate per capita is 4.2 crimes per 100 000 citizens lower, and Norway's prison system is completely rehabilitative. The Pro tries to rebut my arguments about how rehabilitation is an incentive to offend and how it violates justice. This is also flawed. If rehabilitation is an incentive to offend, why would Norway have a lower per capita crime rate than the United States? Furthermore, the majority of what is taught in rehabilitative systems are skills that are designed so when these people get out of prison, they contribute to society. Prison's in Kenya are teaching prisoners making clothes, building furniture, and farming crops, valuable skills that will allow them to contribute to society. [2] The skills that are taught in prisons can be learned elsewhere, not only in prison. This is what I was talking about in my incentive to offend argument. Poorer people usually do not do as well in school and don't always have the money for college. Even with student loans, college is expensive and not everyone has the money for it. If poorer people are not successful in school, why would they be successful in prison? In prison's, they do not teach you math and science. This point on student loans is completely irrelevant. The main point is that you are rewarding the criminal after he commits a crime instead of punishing him for it. Prison is still punishment. Isolation from the outside world is the punishment. My opponent would rather these people be punished, then go out AND REOFFEND WITH A MORE SERIOUS CRIME rather than for them to offend ONCE, and then help society. He says that public opinion has no place in a justice system, because the United States is a democracy, public opinion always matters. In a democracy, the public votes for what they want and things they don't want will not be likely to get anywhere. This is a completely ridiculous point. First, public opinion does not affect justice at all. Just because the majority of people think a man is guilty DOES NOT MAKE HIM GUILTY. Just because the majority of the population thinks that criminals will always be criminals does not make it so. Just because the majority of the population disagrees with rehabilitation DOES NOT MAKE IT INEFFECTIVE. Secondly, the public does not vote on every single aspect of life, so that is invalid. This shows that even after rehabilitation, not many people are willing to accept criminals. After checking my opponent's source, it says LITERALLY NOTHING ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION. Source 3 of R2 merely states \" What's the point of rehabilitation if society won't forgive and forget? As Britain debates the fate of Philip Lawrence's killer, Peter Stanford argues that anyone can turn their life around - with the right help. And one ex-offender tells his story .\" Nowhere in that is public opinion even mentioned with stats, plus this was about Britain, not the United States so it is COMPLETELY irrelevant. Furthermore, the source even goes on to support rehabilitation. As far as I know, you can't have a negative recidivism rate, so these numbers cannot go together. The number is not negative. It is very simple: 2/3rds of people will reoffend. After rehabilitation, reoffending rates fell by 83%. That means instead of 66% of criminals reoffending, it is more like 12% of criminals reoffending. Also, the Pro's evidence from Norway may sound nice, but they have a very different society from us. There are so many other variables that you cannot say that rehabilitation is the cause of their low crime rate. Rehabilitation is completely the cause of their low crime rate. I have proven that rehab reduces repeat offenses and turns criminals into working members of society. Both of these lead to a lower crime rate. Deterrence has been proven to stop 15 crimes for each criminal locked up, so taking away deterrence would increase the crime rate 15X. This stat is completely bogus. If the United States has a reported crime rate of 11 877 218 crimes [3], meaning that without the deterrence factor we would have 178 158 270 crimes, or roughly 1/3 people being criminals. Furthermore, if this was true we would have a steadily dropping crime rate as we are incarcerating more people, yet as I have shown this is not the case. FURTHERMORE, why would we have repeat crime then if prison deters so many people? My opponent also makes the mistake of ASSUMING THERE WILL BE NO MORE PUNISHMENT. Upon researching this case, I found a study titled \"Prisons failing to deter repeat criminals in 41 states.\" Clearly my opponent is flawed in this point. All of my opponent's points are extremely flawed with incorrect stats. All the facts point to rehabilitation decreasing crime and helping people help society.

There will be no new evidence provided because this is Round 4. \"The question is that whether losing political power today constitutes a weakening image of the church, to which I say, no.\" The debate resolution can speak for itself: \"The Roman Catholic Church has Become Weak.\" There is nothing about political weakness in particular. See round two where I provided the definitions of the term weak as well. As Pro I have provided how the church has become weak in several different ways. \"By doing so, he became blind and biased in this debate that instead of attacking a wider scope, he focused just on limited part of the debate. His argument can be summed up with this statement: The church does not have political powers unlike in the middle ages, so I win. But this not the case.\" Con is asserting a farcical statement late in the debate. In round two , I provided three forms of weakness to show the Catholic Church has become weak. I showed how according to the strictest definition of the term, \"weak ,\" the Roman Catholic Church has become the embodiment of it. The most common definition of the term \"weak\" applies to \"physical prowess.\" Con has intentionally ignored two out of three of those weaknesses which included physical and spiritual weakness. Instead he has focused on responding to the political weakness. As Pro, I have acknowledged all of his claims and responded in turn. So it is not I who is blind and biased. \"In round 2, I have proven that the Church has survived in the changing time where others failed, its growing population is ever increasing which results to increase in influence, and that it still have political influence today. All these things point to one thing: The church has not weakened.\" Survival has nothing to do with strength. I refuted this point in Round 2 when I discussed legitimacy. This is the final round so let us summon the points I have presented to confirm the resolution that has been proposed. 1. This debate is inherently a comparative debate about the Roman Catholic Church's past compared to the present circumstances. We are debating the strength of the Roman Catholic Church. Con has yielded to provide any evidence on how the Roman Catholic Church is stronger than in the past. Instead, Con has provided us with the evidence in a dramatic rise in membership. I refuted this point in the third round. 2. All three forms of weakness that I discussed in the second round stand. The three forms of weakness included physical weakness, political weakness, and spiritual weakness. Con has failed to refute them, nevertheless acknowledge them. Two out of three of them weren't even discussed thoroughly. One of the two, spiritual weakness was glazed over by Con which was spiritual weakness in round two. But Con provided no contrary evidence to my second round claim of how the Catholic Church conforms their beliefs according to the wishes of others. Therefore, all three points of weakness stand as is. See Round Two. 3. The Roman Catholic Church's survival has nothing to do with strength or weakness. See Round Three. 4. A larger membership in the Roman Catholic Church has not brought about more strength. The Roman Catholic Church is incapable of calling a Crusade. It does not matter if they excommunicate someone from the Church. See Rounds Two and Three. I would like to thank Con for participating in this debate. If you believe that I have shown the Catholic Church has become weak according to the strictest definition of the term weak, Vote Pro. If you believe that all three forms of weakness that I showed validated the decline of Roman Catholic Church's strength, Vote Pro."}], "ideology": "Argument: It is important to be more specific when discussing the potential problems caused by sex before marriage in our modern society.

Considering the fact that the two video games I've mentioned in arguments 1 and 2 are part of the \"Spongebob Squarepants\" franchise, and the two video games bear the \"Spongebob Squarepants\" logo, my arguments are still valid. 2. \"Spongebob can easily call upon his best friend, Patrick Star, who can eat pretty much anything as seen by quite a few of the episodes. If that doesn't work, he can just sit on the robot until it of course explodes, breaks, runs out of batter, etc.\" I agree that Spongebob can call Patrick. I also agree that Patrick can eat through many substances. However, I doubt that Patrick can digest, let alone swallow, solid metal. In fact, Patrick has never been shown to eat metal in the series.

However, should that happen, Plankton can simply brainwash them with the \"Chum is Fum\" slogan, (evidenced in the Spongebob Episode: Chum Bucket Supreme). At that point, they would stop attacking him, and he could feed some of them chum to make them sick. The other brainwashed citizens will move away, not wanting to get sick. Should Spongebob try to interfere, an enlargened Robo Krabs could prevent Spongebob or Patrick from interfering. Should all else fail and Plankton be trampled, he will not be rendered unconscious. Because Plankton has frequently been squashed by multiple characters throughout the series, his body has grown resistant enough to remain conscious despite being trampled. Argument. 1. Plankton can use his \"Mind-controlling Chum buckets\" (from the \"Spongebob Squarepants Movie) to sabotage Patrick into attacking Spongebob. After Spongebob summons Patrick, Plankton, in his larger Robo Krabs, can grab Patrick and force the bucket onto Patrick's head. Under Plankton's control, Patrick would proceed to attack Spongebob, and Spongebob would not be skilled enough to take on both of them at once. Spongebob would be rendered unconscious from their combined attacks.

My opponent has given three reasons why public schooling is better than home-schooling, so before I get into my positive reasons for home-schooling, I shall deal with her arguments. Curriculum opportunities My opponent asserts that there are usually more curriculum opportunities in public schooling than in home-schooling. However, such claims are unfounded, and unreferenced. Many home-schoolers also participate in online classes, run by private companies. For example, (not to toot my own horn) I have been able to study Latin for 8 years, which involved translating Caesar's Gallic Wars, as well as Cicero's First and Third Orations against Catiline, and his First Oration against Verres. (1) Furthermore, I have been able to study different coures on traditional logic, (2) as well as philosophy. While not every home-schooler may take advantage of these opportunities, the opportunities are still present. The amount of different courses available to home-schoolers through the internet is immense. This suffices to demonstrate that Pro's assertions are unfounded-the internet has allowed for almost any subject a student desires to learn about. Working with others Once again, Pro's arguments fail. Some home-schoolers participate in group home-school classes, where they are able to interact with each other. Furthermore, how to interact with other people can be easily learned through any sort of part-time job, or summer job. It is not an essential part of an education to teach the student how to interact with others. Social skills Home-schoolers being socially inept is nothing more than a myth. Home-schoolers often participate in home-school group events. This can range from anywhere to Church meetings to a formal dance. At events such as these, home-schoolers are given opportunities to learn social skills, and how to interact with others. Arguments in favor of home-schooling Now that I have refuted my opponent's arguments, I shall present some positive reasons why home-schooling may be better than public schooling. 1. Each person is different While public schooling may be better for some, it's also very plausible to accept that home-schooling may be better for others. Someone who is prone to being bullied, or easily distracted by their friends, may find it much easier to learn in a different, quieter atmosphere. So while public schools may be good for some, we should also accept the possibility that home schooling may be better for others. 2. Superior test scores Furthermore, home-schoolers regularly perform better on standardized tests. According to the US Department of Education, the average ACT score for a home-schooler is 22.6 (3) This is 1.5 points higher than the National Average ACT, which is 21.1 (4) Once again, I can personally attest to this fact. Most of my friends who are home schoolers have scored above 25 on their ACT tests. According to educationnews.org: \"Homeschooling statistics show that those who are independently educated [home-schooled] typically score between the 65th and 89th percentile on such exams, while those attending traditional schools average on the 50th percentile.\" (5) Conclusion It should be no surprise that the amount of home-schoolers has risen by 75% since 1999 (5). Home-schooling affords all the oppurtunities of public-schooling, results in superior education (as evidenced by the ACT averages), and avoids the negative aspects of public schools, such as bullying and distraction. Thus, it has been established that public schooling is not better than homeschooling, and that homeschooling may even be better. I await Pro's response! Sources: (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>...

My opponent claimed that because gay men share the same traits as women, and women get cheaper car insurance, homosexual gentlemen should get cheaper deals than straight men as well. I agree with my opponent in so much as gay men share a dangerous lack of driving skills with women, that's undeniably true. To illustrate this, ask yourself this: how many Formula 1 drivers have there ever been that are either women or gay? The answer is: none. Not one, not a single one, ever in the entire history of the sport. Is that because the world governing body of motorsport, The Fdration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) is institutionally sexist and homophobic? No, as part of their sporting code, they do not have a clause that stipulates: \"Racing Licences are issued to any applicant whose conduct and competence is adjudged by the FIA to be satisfactory, provided they are over 18 years of age, a man (not a woman) and not one of those filthy, depraved uphill-gardeners like Freddy Mercury out of Queen, Hollywood's Tom Cruise, or Cristiano Ronaldo - the cheating pretty-boy from Manchester United.\" <URL>... No, the fact is that straight men are the most skillful drivers and, therefore, the most able to control their vehicle safely in the event of a emergency. My opponent went on to suggest that while gay men risk AIDS every time they have unprotected, er...shenanigans with another man, straight men risk conceiving a child every time they have sex with a woman without taking proper precautions. The difference is, of course, a straight man can get the fetus aborted but the gay man is stuck with AIDS for the rest of his (drastically curtailed) life. Never mind that though, the point is that all men, gay and straight, are naturally risk takers so any discount that may be offered to women in recognition of their cautious nature should not be (and is not) extended to men of a homosexual persuasion. With regard to Saudi Arabia, I only mentioned this as an example of a regime that has recognised the shortcomings of women drivers and have legislated accordingly. I wouldn't like to see the same policies introduced here in Europe though, as I often rely on a lift home from the pub from girls (it's scary, but when you are drunk, you don't care so much). Now to the million dollar question about bi-sexual men. I have thought long and hard about this and concluded that there is no such thing as bi-sexual men. I mean, once a bloke has had his first go on a proper fit bird, why would he consider another man sexually attractive? No, it doesn't make sense. When was the last time you had dinner with a vegetarian who ordered watercress soup for starters but had fillet steak (rare) for the main course? No, \"bi-sexual\" men might not be as camp as openly gay men, but they are still gay and insurers should charge them extra accordingly.

{"basic": "Argument: My opponent's argument in favor of the electoral college is flawed and fails to address the true issues at hand. Firstly, he argues that the electoral college helps equalize power between small and large states by giving smaller states a voice. However, this argument overlooks the fact that the population of U.S. territories is greater than 4,000,000, which is almost twice the population of Wyoming. Even if we consider my opponent's claim that 30% of voters are Republican, 30% are Democratic, and the remaining 40% are the deciding factor, the number of \"Voters That Matter\" in U.S. territories still far exceeds the entire population of Wyoming. \n\nSecondly, my opponent brings up the Florida recount as an example of the clash between the popular vote and the electoral vote. While it is true that Al Gore won the popular vote but lost in the electoral vote, this only highlights the flaws of the electoral college system. The clash between the votes cast by the electors and the tallied popular vote shows that the electoral college can lead to discrepancies and undermine the principle of democracy.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent argues that minorities have more power on a national level with the electoral college. However, the winner-take-all system employed by the electoral college makes it virtually impossible for a third party to sway or change the outcome of an election. Additionally, the idea that minorities have more power on a national level is flawed because the resolution clearly states \"direct popular vote,\" which implies that every citizen's voice should be heard without the interference of the states. Under the current winner-take-all system, a Democrat in Texas, for example, has no way of having their voice heard.\n\nThe main point I am trying to convey is that the number of electorates is based on census count, which means that the number of votes cast in a state does not matter. For instance, if only one person votes in California, all of the electoral votes are given to the chosen party. On the other hand, if 2,500,000 people in Utah vote, their 2,500,000 votes are only worth 6 electoral votes. This scenario, although exaggerated, highlights the inequality of the electoral college system. Even though Florida had 800,000 more votes than New York, it is still worth less in the electoral college because the number of electors is based on census count, not the amount of votes. \n\nIn order to achieve equality for all U.S. citizens, a direct popular vote is the better choice compared to the electoral college. This is because, firstly, territories have no representation in Congress and therefore no say in presidential elections, despite being directly affected by the outcome. Secondly, the electoral college has outlived its usefulness and fails to accurately represent the will of the people. Thirdly, a direct popular vote strengthens the principles of democracy by eliminating regional advantages and increasing voter turnout. In a direct popular vote, each vote goes to the candidate of choice, ensuring that every vote counts and encouraging greater participation from the populace. Lastly, the number of electoral votes is based on census count, not voter turnout, which further undermines the fairness and equality of the electoral college system.", "len_basic": 3306, "len_orig": 3003, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "I argue that rap beats should have a more complex rhythm and tempo.

Exhibit 1: Humpty Dumpty Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, All the King's Horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty together again. Most people look at this rhyme and remember the egg in a story book they've read but in looking at the real context of this rhyme we realize that Humpty Dumpty dates back to the Civil War. Humpty Dumpty is a rhyme showing how a cannon named Humpty fell during the war and because there was no time it wasn't put back together. Exhibit 2: Ring Around The Rosie Ring around the rosy A pocketful of posies \"Ashes, Ashes\" We all fall down! This rhyme dates back to the Great Plague. The symptoms included a rosy rash, which inspired the first line. It was believed that the disease was carried by bad smells, so people frequently carried pockets full of fresh petals. The \"ashes, ashes\" line is believed to refer to the cremation of the bodies. Exhibit 3: Baa Baa Black Sheep Baa baa black sheep, Have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, Three bags full. One for the Master, One for the Dame, And none for the little boy, who cries down the lane. The song is not about sheep, or little boys. King Edward I knew that he could make some decent cash by taxing the sheep farmers. Because of the new taxes, one third of the price of a sack of wool went to the king, one third to the church and the last third to the farmer. Nothing was left for the shepherd boy, crying down the lane. Exhibit 4: Mary, Mary, quite contrary Mary, Mary quite contrary, How does your garden grow? With silver bells and cockle shells And pretty maids all in a row This rhyme is a reference to Queen Mary the 1. The garden refers to growing cemeteries, as she filled them with the Protestants she killed. Silver bells and cockle shells were instruments of torture and the maiden was a device used to behead people. Exhibit 5: For want of a nail For want of a nail the shoe was lost For want of a shoe the horse was lost For want of a horse the rider was lost For want of a rider the battle was lost For want of a battle the kingdom was lost And all for the want of a horseshoe nail This rhyme shows that if you don't have basic necessities in life it will lead to terrible consequences.

{"basic": "Argument: It is evident that my opponent has failed to present an argument in this debate. However, I will take this opportunity to present some additional points in a concise manner. Hopefully, my opponent will return for their next round.\n\nFirstly, textbooks possess the advantage of not requiring batteries, a Wi-Fi connection, or special storage conditions, apart from being kept dry. This durability in terms of use makes them more reliable, especially for individuals in remote areas without access to power or the internet. It is crucial that these individuals have the ability to learn and access information.\n\nFurthermore, textbooks excel in long-term storage. With the rapid obsolescence of technology, storing data long-term necessitates regular upgrades and maintenance. Servers, for instance, require expensive cooling towers, full-time staff, and infrastructure. In contrast, books do not face these challenges.

Firstly, textbooks do not rely on batteries, Wi-Fi connections, or specific storage conditions, except for staying dry. This durability ensures that individuals in remote areas without power or internet access can still acquire knowledge and access information. This inclusivity is crucial in providing equal opportunities for education to all citizens.\n\nFurthermore, textbooks excel in long-term storage capabilities. Unlike technology, which rapidly becomes obsolete, textbooks do not require regular upgrades or maintenance. Storing data long-term on servers is not only expensive but also demands cooling towers, full-time staff, and infrastructure. In contrast, books have been discovered throughout history that have not been properly cared for, yet they remain accessible without the need for firmware updates or reverse engineering. The costs associated with maintaining book archives are minimal, limited to filtered air and numbered shelves, along with the necessary staff.\n\nMoreover, textbooks offer unparalleled security against attacks, including technological and cyber warfare. Once secured in a bomb-proof shelter, books become impervious to any form of hacking or shutdown. Additionally, distributing books to individuals or airdropping them ensures their untraceability, making them a reliable source of information in sensitive situations.\n\nLastly, textbooks even prove advantageous in hypothetical scenarios such as zombie apocalypses. Their physical presence and lack of reliance on technology make them a reliable resource when other forms of communication and information retrieval are compromised.

We are not taking into effect whether the university was wrongly accused or found guilty wrongfully. For the interest of saving time, I will address the topic as if the university has been found to be guilty. 1. If the university ahs been found guilty, then A) it must have been the faculty of the universtiy or the higher positions within the university that chose to do this. If so, then the faculty should be fired and fined accordingly. This method not only serves justice, but also discourages future incidences and lets the student body know that it isn't tolerated. B) a portion of the student body was found guilty of software piracy. If so, then the appropriate students should be found and expelled and the neccessary fines should be imposed.

Argument Many people consider gold to be a relic, nothing more than a novelty item worn on ring fingers and necklaces. There is some minor industrial usage, but industrial demand pales in comparison to jewelry demand [1]. If this was the entire story, then gold indeed would be aptly classified as a relic, however, investment demand (i.e., bar and coin and ETF demand) for the yellow metal is at a decade high [1] in terms of both tonnage and dollar value. Gold is not a productive asset, it does not produce a yield, and has little to no industrial purpose, therefore its viability as an investment is dubious. However, the dollar also shares these same characteristics - the dollar is not a productive asset, it does not produce a yield unless deposited at a bank, and has absolutely no industrial purpose. The dollar is also generally accepted as a means of exchange and not an investment. Gold thus shares many characteristics synonymous with money, and should thus be defined as such. In summary: Gold is not an useless relic because it has significant investment demand. However, gold is not an investment, because it shares many traits with money and not investments. Thus, gold is money.

It is one that I have never before considered and will do my best to establish. Argument What do we mean by omnipotent. By saying that God is omnipotent means that he has the power to implement whatever he desires. If god was not omnipotent that would mean that there is something that He could wish to do that He would be incapable of. If He could not do something, then He cannot be by definition perfect. If God is imperfect then He cannot be omniscient, because He cannot know the effects of something that He could not do. If God is not omniscient and omnipotent, then He is not necessarily unchangeable. And if God can change then He cannot have the attributes of perfection, because only perfection cannot be improved upon. Thus, if God is not perfect then he cannot contain the various attributes of perfection such as perfect love or perfect justice. If God is not perfect love nor able to exercise perfect justice, then such things do not actually exist because it then becomes conceivable that we, his creations, could theoretically be more loving or more just than God. If this were true then you arrive at a paradox. We have love and justice because we are made in the image of God. If God's love and justice are flawed then so is our own love and justice. Our attributes, instead of being a reflection of the perfect love and justice of God, would only be a reflection of the imperfect. If our attributes are a reflection of the imperfect then we cannot know if there is true love or justice because what we receive from the one who created us are of a finite, and thus possibly flawed, nature. This makes any \"love\" to be suspect, and makes any application of justice immoral because they are both based on a flawed or incomplete attributes to begin with. Finally an \"imperfect God\" cannot exist in eternity. A finite God would ultimately be an evil God. If God is not perfect and infinite, then God is not completely self sufficient. This is because God would then have limits. Imagine having a library of 10 books that you love. Now you are locked in the library for a day. Not a problem. You might read 1 book, maybe 2 if you read fast. Now imagine being stuck there for a week, a year, a century, a millennia. You would become would come to hate those books instead of loving those books. That is because you, existing as a being of potential, have reached a limit. This would happen to any intelligent being of potential once their potential has exhausted their limits. In this sense God would not be the perfect God of the Bible, but rather like the imperfect gods of the Greeks and Romans. Ultimately, this would lead to the logical conclusion that God is evil. If God is not perfect, it is immoral for Him to send anyone to hell, because he cannot be assured that His justice is perfect. So let's say that God lets everyone into heaven. Even then God would have to be acknowledged as evil. This is because after a certain period of time in his presence we would cease to be satisfied. Ultimately, like in the library example, we would become bored with eternity, because our potential would never be fully realized. For God to create people knowing that there is no choice for them but to be subjected to an eternity of torment, through no fault of their own, is the very opposite of love and justice. As such God cannot be a finite being of potential, but must be one of the infinite or the \"actual\". If God is omnipotent, it is possible for Him to be omniscient and omnipresent. If these are true, then the remainder of His attributes will also be perfect in nature and thus His love and justice would be perfect. His infinite nature would never be exhausted and would lead to eternal joy for those who are in His presence. Conclusion I have shown the necessity for God to be infinitely powerful in order for him to be considered God. For, if he is not without limits, all of creation would ultimately be evil otherwise."}], "ideology": "Argument: It is important to consider the facts surrounding the culling of animals in Australia before jumping to conclusions.

{"basic": "Thank you, Mixer, for allowing me to take part in this debate. I appreciate the opportunity to present my arguments. I would like to address the points made by my opponent. Firstly, my opponent argues that \"justice must be served\". However, it is important to consider whose standard of justice we are referring to. It is worth noting that 29% of Americans are against the death penalty [4]. While this may seem like a relatively small number, it actually represents an estimated 90,519,935 Americans who do not support capital punishment. \n\nSecondly, my opponent claims that the death penalty acts as a deterrent. While this logic may apply to average individuals, it is important to consider that murderers, particularly serial killers, often have Antisocial Personality Disorder or psychopathy [5].

By the time they commit a murder, they have likely prioritized the thrill or pleasure they derive from killing over their own lives.\n\nLastly, my opponent argues that the death penalty saves innocent lives by preventing offenders from committing further murders. However, my opponent fails to provide the actual number of people affected by this statistic.\n\nNow, I would like to present my own arguments as to why the death penalty should be repealed. Firstly, the cost of executing killers is exorbitant. According to Ed Barnes, a death penalty trial costs $1 million more than a trial seeking life without parole [6]. Additionally, a study by the Urban Institute on Maryland's experience with the death penalty found that the cost to taxpayers for the five executions carried out by the state since 1978 amounted to $37.2 million each, totaling $186 million [7]. The Death Penalty Information Center states that it is much more cost-effective to keep these individuals in prison until they die. Furthermore, prisoners could be put to work, offsetting the expenses of their imprisonment and the costs borne by the public in defending them.\n\nSecondly, the concept of the right to life is fundamental and enshrined in our Declaration of Independence, which guarantees \"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\" [8]. Taking the life of even a murderer places us on the same level as them and makes us hypocrites within our justice system.\n\nIn conclusion, the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for criminals, it is financially burdensome, and it contradicts the principles of justice and the right to life. Therefore, I urge you to vote against the death penalty.", "len_basic": 2554, "len_orig": 63, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "Thank you posting your argument quickly. For the sake of clarity, I offer some definitions. Death penalty - Capital Punishment; putting one to death for crimes that one has committed. Justified - to prove or show to be just, right, or reasonable [1] Should - used in auxiliary function to express obligation, propriety, or expediency [2] Justice - the establishment or determination of rights according to the rules of law [3] ***** First I will address your points, then continue to my own. Your first argument is that \"justice must be served\". However, who's standard of justice are you speaking of? Not the standard of the 29% of Americans who are against the death penalty. [4] That may seem like a relatively small number, but when you do the math, that is an estimated 90,519,935 Americans that do not support capital punishment. You then claim that the death penalty works as deterrent. While your logic makes sense when applied to average people, Murderers, (serial killers in particular) often have Antisocial Personality Disorder. (Also known as psychopaths) [5] These people do not subscribe to social norms, and they do not 'gel' with society. They are in a class all their own. By the time they commit a murder, they will most likely have decided that the thrill (or whatever pleasure they get) from the kill is more important than their lives. Your final argument is that the death penalty saves the lives of innocent people because \"that in the U.S. 1.2% of offenders who committed murder were arrested within 3 years of being released because they murdered another person\" , but you never say how many people this actually is. ***** Now I have two main points as to why the death penalty should be repealed. First \"The cost of killing killers is killing us.\" (Ed Barnes)[6] This article goes on to say that a death-penalty trial costs $1 million more than one in which prosecutors seek life without parole. Furthermore, an Urban Institute study of Maryland's experience with the death penalty found that since 1978, the cost to taxpayers for the five executions the state carried out was $37.2 million dollars -- each. This comes out to 186 million dollars. The Death Penalty Information Center [7] states that \"It is much cheaper to put these people in prison and leave them there until they die.\" Better yet, when these people are put in prison, they should be put to work. They once were a detriment to society; they should do some good before they leave this world. Prison is essentially a free ride; one gets clean clothes, hot food, and a bed to sleep in at the expense of the general population. Sending prisoners to work may offset the costs of keeping them imprisoned, and the money spent by the public defending them. My second point is hundreds of years old. 235 years old to be exact. Our great country has what is called the Declaration of Independence, which not only turned us into America, but guaranteed \"Life, Liberty, and The Pursuit of Happiness\" [8]. Life is the most basic of human rights. To take the life of even a murderer, puts one on that same level, and makes one a murderer themselves. In conclusion, because the death penalty is not necessarily a deterrent to criminals, and because capital punishment is expensive, and because taking the lives of murderers makes America's justice system hypocritical, I urge you to please vote CON! ***** Sources: [1] <URL>...

I would like to address the points made by my opponent thus far.\n\nFirstly, my opponent argues that \"justice must be served\". However, it is important to consider whose standard of justice we are referring to. It is worth noting that there is a significant portion of the American population, approximately 29%, who are against the death penalty [4]. While this may seem like a relatively small number, when we do the math, it amounts to an estimated 90,519,935 Americans who do not support capital punishment. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the diverse perspectives on what constitutes justice.\n\nSecondly, my opponent claims that the death penalty acts as a deterrent. While this argument may hold true for average individuals, it is important to recognize that murderers, particularly serial killers, often suffer from Antisocial Personality Disorder, commonly known as psychopathy [5]. These individuals do not conform to societal norms and do not align with the values of our society. By the time they commit a murder, they have likely prioritized the thrill or pleasure they derive from killing over their own lives. Therefore, the argument that the death penalty serves as a deterrent may not be applicable to this specific group of individuals.\n\nLastly, my opponent argues that the death penalty saves the lives of innocent people by preventing offenders from committing further murders. However, it is crucial to note that my opponent fails to provide the actual number of individuals affected by this statistic. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the true impact of the death penalty in saving innocent lives.\n\nNow, I would like to present my own arguments as to why the death penalty should be repealed. Firstly, I would like to highlight the financial burden associated with capital punishment. According to an article by Ed Barnes, a death penalty trial costs approximately $1 million more than a trial where prosecutors seek life without parole [6]. Additionally, a study conducted by the Urban Institute on Maryland's experience with the death penalty revealed that since 1978, the cost to taxpayers for the five executions carried out by the state amounted to $37.2 million each, totaling $186 million [7]. The Death Penalty Information Center further asserts that it is much more cost-effective to keep these individuals in prison for life. Moreover, I propose that prisoners should be put to work as a means to offset the costs of their imprisonment and the expenses incurred by the public in defending them. By allowing prisoners to contribute positively to society, we can ensure that they make amends for their past actions.\n\nSecondly, I would like to draw attention to the principles outlined in our nation's Declaration of Independence, which has been the foundation of our great country for 235 years. The Declaration guarantees the rights to \"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness\" [8]. Life is the most fundamental human right, and by taking the life of even a murderer, we place ourselves on the same level and become perpetrators of murder ourselves. This contradicts the principles upon which our justice system is built and makes us hypocritical in our pursuit of justice.\n\nIn conclusion, considering that the death penalty may not effectively deter criminals, the significant financial burden it imposes, and the moral implications it raises, I urge you to vote against the continuation of the death penalty.

The Death Penalty Information Center suggests that it is far more cost-effective to keep these individuals in prison for life. Furthermore, prisoners should be given the opportunity to contribute positively to society through work programs, as they were once a detriment to society.

{"basic": "Argument: When discussing the topic of abortion, it is important to consider the different perspectives and analogies that can be used to understand the concept. One analogy that can be used is comparing abortion to an egg. Is abortion like an egg that cracked, a chicken that died, or an egg that never hatched?\n\nBy comparing abortion to an egg that cracked, we can understand it as a situation where something that had the potential for life was damaged or destroyed. Just like a cracked egg cannot be used for its intended purpose, a pregnancy that is terminated through abortion prevents the potential life from developing further.\n\nOn the other hand, comparing abortion to a chicken that died brings up the idea of a life that was already in existence but was ended prematurely. This analogy suggests that abortion is equivalent to ending a life that has already begun, similar to the death of a chicken.\n\nLastly, considering abortion as an egg that never hatched allows us to view it as a situation where the potential for life was never realized. Just like an egg that never hatches will never become a chicken, a pregnancy that is terminated through abortion prevents the potential life from ever coming into existence.\n\nEach of these analogies presents a different perspective on abortion, highlighting the complexity of the issue. By considering these different viewpoints, we can engage in a more nuanced and informed discussion about the moral and ethical implications of abortion.", "len_basic": 1493, "len_orig": 84, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "I thank my opponent for his response. 1. My opponent's statement that I cannot separate Lady Gaga from her music is factually incorrect and/or simply misstated. I am not trying to separate her from her music at all. The point of this debate, again, was to illustrate the fact that her lyrics and music are causing a negative impact on not only the music industry, but on the music community itself. I am CONJOINING her and her music, not separating her from it at all. I view her music as the problem in this debate and the source of the argument, not as an ignorant thing that is just to be thrown to the side. When you compare the music Lady GaGa produces to the actions she performs, it is if you are looking at two different people: on the one hand, there is a woman who is out speaking her mind for what she believes in in a good and honest way (her actions). However, when you listen to her music and lyrics, you see a person who seems bent on drinking, engaging in unsafe sexual actions with the first thing that moves (Just Dance), stalking (Paparazzi), lying masochism about her sexuality (Poker face), and masochism (Bad Romance, Telephone). And who hears all of this unsavory behavior? Anyone willing to listen. 2. My opponent mentions the 'imagery' Gaga creates. Now, exactly, what imagery would this be? Let us examine said video (located at the top right, top video): From the opening minute, we see a woman who is literally lying prone on the street being photographed by the 'Paparazzi' that she sings about. Then, said woman is put in a wheelchair, and instead of being taken to a place like a hospital, is wheeled into a lobby, and promptly stripped down to her underwear. Constantly, there are images of her lying in what appears to be a stripper-esc outfit on a couch in seductive positions. As these images flash by at a high rate of speed, she continues to tell us how she will stalk someone until they 'love her', though I see and feel no love in these images. Murder scenes are then constantly portrayed as she starts referencing cigarettes. The rest of the video is summed up by Gaga being 'felt up' by others, more seductive positions and weird imagery, more lyrics about stalking, and it culminates in a fake 9-1-1 call with Gaga saying she just killed her boyfriend. 3. The third main point my opponent makes is that since all of this is okay and 'accepted by society' and that 'everyone is doing it', it is not okay for me to focus on Gaga alone. I thought we were DEBATING about Lady GaGa? The purpose of this debate is not, never was, and never will be to argue about anyone or anything but the impact of LADY GAGA on the music industry. Not Ke$ha. Not Britney Spears. Lady Gaga and Lady Gaga alone. Just because everyone else is doing it doesn't make it right and I intend to continue to show that Gaga's music and antics are both counter-productive, poisonous and, overall, damaging. Also, thank you for conceding the point that Lady Gaga is on the same level as all of these people that can also be considered damaging influences via their lyrics and songs. 4. My opponent states that an 8 year old is mentally developed enough to understand the song, and that \"...Regardless, it would provide for a good learning opportunity and a chance for the parent to explain why alcohol is wrong and why you need to have safe sex, why drugs are bad and so on...\" I'd assume that this child would be getting these teachings from either their parent or someone besides Lady Gaga, correct? Because when you listen to her music, it seems as if all of these things are not just accepted; they are commonplace. I believe that the person who needs to be taught those values are not the theoretical eight year old: the person who needs to learn those potentially life-saving values are Lady GaGa herself, and her music preaches just the opposite. Now, after everything that has just been said, the problem still remains: what is the message at the heart of the song? What is the message in her lyrics? Where is the notion that everything is NOT okay with this? Well, I can tell you one news network who wasn't too pleased with Ms. Lady Gaga: Fox (video below 'Paparazzi' vid, top right). The news report suggests that the video was \"Pushing TWISTED SEXUAL FANTASIES on YOUNG CHILDREN\". Sound familiar? There seems to be a recurring trend in Gaga's lyrics: sex, drugs, and good old fashioned violence. The sex part is in literally every song (I'll reinforce this point later; I hate this character limit), the drugs (mostly alcohol) are evident in, again, mostly every song (Also, Gaga's 'Telephone' vid was reportedly banned from MTV for the same reasons I iterate here). The violence portion is more in the videos, with the killing of the boyfriend and what-not. And as you can see from the most recent advancements in technology and availability of music, it is quite easy for young children to gain access to this music, absorb its information again AND again AND again, and eventually take hold of the misconception that, as Gaga says 'Everything's fine. Just Dance.', when in the real world, everything is far from fine. They don't understand that alcohol, exposing yourself to anyone, mindless sex, death, stalking, and many many other things are NOT okay. They shouldn't even be dealing with those things at such an age! But there the songs are: ready to take children in their grip and teach them everything they DIDN'T need to know. And who lets, no, CAUSES these things to happen? Lady Gaga and her 'music'.

Unfortunately that is not the case. We still have many, many arguments in the world that have no evidence involved whatsoever. I got into an argument with my teacher today over whether or not I should have to do the work she assigned. She gave me a detention because she \"didn't like hearing me complain.\" Did we argue? Yes. Was it reasonable to give me a detention to avoid confronting the truth? No. Perhaps you view it the other way, in that I was at fault. In that case, would it have been logical for me to argue with the teacher? Hardly. In most arguments, there is one (or more) sides arguing without logic or factual evidence. Do we still classify it as arguing? We certainly do. Does PRO propose changing the way the word 'argument' is used so that he can win this debate? --- My opponent does give a definition of 'argument.'

From a conservative perspective, life is believed to begin at conception. This viewpoint is rooted in the belief that every human being, regardless of their stage of development, deserves the right to life and protection under the law.\n\nTo illustrate this perspective, let us consider the analogy of an egg. An egg has the potential to become a living being, whether it is cracked, dies, or never hatches. Similarly, a fertilized egg, or zygote, has the potential to develop into a fully formed human being. By terminating a pregnancy through abortion, it can be argued that this potential for life is being extinguished.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the issue of abortion is complex and multifaceted.

{"basic": "Argument: Sunglasses\n\nI believe that Imabench may have a rebellious teenage persona based on his use of the word \"cool.\" It seems that he would only consider an animal \"cool\" if it had a strong interest in sports or could perform a unique trick with its belly button. However, these qualities are merely novelties, and it seems foolish to prioritize saving animals based on their perceived coolness. As an intellectual, I find this perspective to be rather unintelligent.\n\nFurthermore, it is widely known that animals lack intelligence. In fact, I would even go so far as to suggest renaming them \"dumbimals.\" Allow me to provide a few examples to support this claim. Firstly, cats have a tendency to exhibit aggressive behavior and seem to derive pleasure from the suffering of other living beings. Additionally, they tend to be overweight. Secondly, horses have never accomplished anything noteworthy. They have never won a gold medal at the Olympics, made any significant scientific discoveries, or even won the WWE Championship. Lastly, birds are primarily known for their singing abilities, but I have yet to come across an album produced by a bird in any supermarket.\n\nMoney is undeniably the most valuable asset. It is common knowledge that implementing the endangered species act would require a significant amount of financial resources. However, animals are incapable of comprehending this fact. If we were to allow all animals to perish, we would not have to allocate any of our money towards their preservation. Instead, we could live in a world where everyone is surrounded by piles of money, leading to ultimate happiness.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the implementation of programs such as the endangered species act often leads to the emergence of annoying activists. These individuals tend to bother us normal people who still possess money in our wallets. By allowing animals to die off, we would eliminate the existence of these bothersome individuals and be able to enjoy our shopping experiences without their interference.\n\nIf a particular species were to go extinct, it would simply indicate that they were weak and not favored by the process of evolution. I cannot recall a single instance where an animal has initiated a program to assist humans. Therefore, I fail to see why we should extend our help to these uninteresting creatures.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that humans were designed to dominate this planet. We are the superior species and are perfectly suited to be the rulers of the world. Therefore, attempting to save animals is a foolish endeavor. Who knows, they may even evolve into super robots beyond the moon with intentions of world domination, and we would be ill-equipped to stop them. This would result in eternal injustice, which is something we should strive to avoid. Taking risks and allowing animals to die off is the best course of action.\n\nEven if we were certain that these endangered species would not evolve into robotic beings, I still believe that \"cool\" animals should be left to perish. From personal experience, I have found that \"cool\" individuals tend to be unpleasant and engage in behaviors such as stealing your food or playing pranks on you.

In my response, I wrote, \"You can not prove with 100 percent certainty that I can not prove with 100% certainty that you are not a monkey.\" This is also true. Therefore, I have also proven one thing. In R2, Pro writes that I have failed to provide an argument for her to refute. However, she has not proven that this is true. I can prove that it's not true by noting I did indeed make a statement in the previous round, and in order to refute that statement she would have to prove it untrue. Therefore, since she could have proven my contention wrong, I did indeed provide an argument. Thus, Pro's assertion that I did not provide an argument is false; she has not (can not) prove it. Next, Pro says that I have not taken this debate seriously. You'll notice that Pro did not (can not) prove that either. However, I can contend that argument (disprove - or at least show genuinely, as the definition implies) that I have in fact taken this debate seriously. My evidence is the fact that I have taken a decent amount of time to respond to my opponent; in fact more time than she has afforded me.

While I may not agree with his perspective, I respect his right to express his opinion. However, I would like to present a counterargument that highlights the importance of preserving endangered species.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to recognize that all animals play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystem. Each species, regardless of its perceived \"coolness,\" contributes to the overall health and stability of our planet. By allowing certain species to go extinct, we risk disrupting this balance and potentially causing irreparable damage to our environment.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that animals are inherently stupid is both unfounded and unfair. Animals possess unique and remarkable abilities that we, as humans, often fail to appreciate. For instance, cats have been known to exhibit incredible agility and hunting skills, which are essential for controlling rodent populations. Horses, on the other hand, have been invaluable companions throughout history, aiding humans in transportation, agriculture, and even warfare. Birds, with their beautiful songs and intricate nests, bring joy and wonder to our lives.\n\nAdditionally, the argument that preserving endangered species is a financial burden is short-sighted. While it is true that implementing conservation measures may require financial resources, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. Biodiversity is not only essential for the health of our planet but also for the advancement of scientific research and medical discoveries. Many life-saving medications and treatments have been derived from studying various animal species.\n\nMoreover, dismissing activists as \"shouty dimwits\" is disrespectful and undermines the importance of their work. These individuals dedicate their lives to raising awareness and advocating for the protection of endangered species. Their efforts should be commended, not ridiculed.\n\nLastly, the argument that humans are the superior species and should prioritize their own interests over those of other creatures is both arrogant and shortsighted. As stewards of this planet, it is our responsibility to protect and preserve all forms of life. By doing so, we ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the preservation of endangered species is not only a moral imperative but also a necessity for the well-being of our planet.

In this round, I will explain how our understanding of the actual nature of Santa Claus helps us to understand how it is easily possible for Santa to accomplish seemingly impossible feats, such as passing out gifts to girls and boys worldwide in a single night . Santa Claus is a vital player in the myths and rituals that surround the Christmas holiday. During the yuletide season he is a staple of television and radio, print and film/ He is out on the streets, meeting his adoring public, overseeing parades, and working as pitchman for a variety of goods and services. Christmas would not be Christmas without Saint Nick. <URL>... (Santa, working the crowd.) The common core of the Santa myth is instantly grasped by children, and widely propagated by adults. This myth, like any other, inspires a range of reactions in the public. Children often simply accept the myth as literal fact, taken at face value. The absurdism of the legends mix easily into the child's world, already largely unexplored and mysterious. Others may reject the myth as a \"lie\" and expose it for a grand deception. However, the most common scenario occurs when people understand the myth for what it is, yet play along with it. This is how the unique phenomenon that makes up the Santa Claus social system survives within a cultural ecosystem that has grown increasingly intolerant of myths of any kind, even religious ones. What makes so many masses of rational adults sincerely fulfil their designated responsibilities as Christmas elves for Santa, most of the time never stopping to marvel at the wondrous interrelatedness of it all? Each year at Christmas time, the ubiquitousness of the Santa Myth is reintroduced, reinforced, marketed and disseminated out to society, thus becoming an irresistible psychological contagion. The millions of people \"infected\" by the Santa concept then mix the myths with role-specific behavior that is reinforced again by social mores that also interact with the larger Christmas season. The result is a crowd psychosis that explodes into the corporatized \"personhood\" of Santa Claus. Participants experience deindividuation as they vanish into the larger social system, becoming \"roles\" instead of individual persons as they relate to their participation in the myth. Participants in the Santa Claus legend then assume their new identities as members of the Santa Claus social system, thus creating that year's \"Santa Claus\" out of their Borg-like cooperation. Essentially, moms and dads are coopted into the larger phenomenon of \"Santa Claus\" in a manner that is directly analogous to Christmas Elves. <URL>...

I'm sure con won't mind if I start my debate in this round. The most obvious place to start I suppose is with the current recession we're in and the total collapse of the western economy. This will be my first premise. It creates a system in which hard working people are extremely likely to fail in the business world--my second premise. Capitalism is a relatively new thing. It has only existed since the industrial revolution began c.1800. This is my third premise. It causes war, destuction and crime--my fourth premise. I'll do my best to stick to these main points and in the order as above. P1) In September of 2008 the global markets crashed with, as we all know, disastrous consequences. But this was not an isolated event caused by a couple of gung-ho, irresponsible bankers who lost control temporarily. There have been dozens of recessions over the last twohundred years, arguably the most notorious in America being the wall street crash of the late 1920s and the recession in the 1980s being the most notorious in Britain. So in that sence the current world leaders ought to bare no blame. In the current system recessions are clearly inevitable. But, I'm sure you'll agree, a system that hosts a recession every few years isn't a system that works. Now; to cure a recession you need to get the banks trading again and to do this the banks need money. You must ask yourself: where will the money come from? The only two European countries that are barely keeping there heads above the water are France and Germany but even they can't afford to lend much more money. In south America you have countries that have never done well to sustain an economy, Mexico and Canada can't afford too loan money and the USA is getting closer to the condition that Greece, Ireland and Portugal are in every day. So want about Asia? Japan was driven back into recession by the nuclear disaster in Fukoshima south Korea has no money to give and china is already owed billions of dollars by the USA. African and middle eastern countries have no real economy as their best assets are already owned by the west. So unless the matins lend us a couple of trillion dollars these recessions are going to carry on happening every few decades. But let's ask ourselves where the money is. Money doesn't just disappear overnight. What's happened is the money is in the hands of a few billionaires who have continued to get richer despite the recession. You may argue that these enourmous anounts of money are necessary to create an incentive for production, that, for example, people would no longer develop technology if they werent treated as better, more elite people for it. But I ask you: would you decide to no longer work or invent things if you weren't paid extortionate amounts of money to do so? Would you go back to living in the medieval ages just because you couldn't have a swimming pool in your house? Our curiosity, imagination and injenuity extends back to times far before the invention of capitalism, back, even, to times before money was invented. No-one paid the cave men to paint. No-one paid for the invention of fire or the Cerne Abbis Giant in Cornwall or the neolithic tombs of the British Isles. or the numerous other feates of human capability throughout history and the world. Money is about greed, not motivation. P2)Despite the fact that I got a bit off course in my first premise I've lead myself neatly into my second premise. Not only would I say that capitalism is not an incentive for creativity - I would go as far as to say it stunts creativity. Why are there so few Bill Gates? Surely there are more people than that with the knowledge to create a business. Well, there are. The problem is people can't afford to create their own products, literature, art etc. This makes sense. For more billionaires to be created current billionaires would have to sacrifice money. Not something they'd be too keen on, is it? So, by definition not every-one can succeed. P3)I've already explained that capitalism is a new thing and isn't peoples incentive to invent and be productive, so I won't elaborate further on that point. P4)As I've already explained: not every-one can succeed in a capitalist society. So if, like at the moment, hundreds of thousands of people across the world find themselves unemployed--what are their options? They are offered social security; a small amount of money designed to merely keep people alive. But this simply isn't good enough for people who are capable of work and want to work. Some people think its their fault theyre unemployed and think that they must deal with the consequences and suffer. Others, though find themselves alienated from the system and gang culture increases. People who could be working end up vandalising and terrorising communities. The government plays this to their advantage by putting people into the prison system and hence the public think that crime is being fought. But the only long term solution to crime is to end unemployment--which capitalism can't do. My final premise is war. Capitalism has always started wars. Did Sadam Hussein posses weapons of mass destruction? No. He had oil. America needs oil--it's worth billions of dollars to them every year. But they couldnt stop at Iraq. They claimed that terrorism was Americas greatest threat. So they had to carry on fighting terrorism or face the consequences for starting a war under false pretensions. They invaded Afghanistan and carried on killing innocent civilians whilst getting the odd radical as-well. Now they want to invade Iran. And what are they accusing Iran of? The ability to create weapons of mass distruction of course. And who owns enough weapons of mass distraction to destroy the world several times over? Britain and America, of course."}, {"effective_argument": "Well this was a patedic debate my opponent didn't even put up a debate and I only forfeited last round due to my opponent forfit thus I had nothing to debate so I say that its your body you do what you want with it and don't shut down peoples right to there own body and belief due to it conflicting with your own."}], "ideology": "Argument: The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will successfully mitigate economic slowdowns over the next year. \n\nObservation 1: The resolution states that the stimulus must be successful, meaning it must result in a favorable outcome.

Pro still has the opportunity to refute my points, and I apologize for any confusion caused by my initial mistake. I would like to address the following arguments that Con has failed to refute.\n\nFirstly, gun bans only prevent legal gun owners from possessing guns. Pro argues that security should be maintained by trained law enforcement professionals, but fails to explain why it should \"only\" be their responsibility. Additionally, Pro suggests that students and staff should stay away from the campus until the threat is resolved, but this fails to address how students would receive a warning of danger. In situations where a criminal brings a gun onto campus, there is often only a short window of time to react, without any prior notice. \n\nSecondly, Pro argues that certain people are not allowed to carry a gun and that there are restrictions on the type of guns people can own. However, this is irrelevant to my case. I am specifically arguing for the allowance of CCW. To become a CCW owner, individuals must pass all necessary tests and meet the qualifications for gun ownership. It is also important to note that all states allow the use of CCW, rendering Pro's rebuttal invalid.\n\nNow, let's consider the case for CCW protecting lives. There have been numerous instances where CCW holders have successfully defended themselves. For example, in Arizona, a University of Arizona student shot two intruders in self-defense. In South Carolina, a Citadel military school student scared off a bat-wielding road rage driver by brandishing a handgun. These are just a few examples, but they demonstrate the potential life-saving benefits of CCW.\n\nIt is worth noting that many of the shootings that occur in the United States happen in states where CCW is banned or on college campuses where it is prohibited. This map clearly illustrates the correlation between CCW bans and the occurrence of shootings. \n\nCon has yet to present any disadvantages of banning CCW, with their only evidence being that the majority of college presidents and students in Iowa do not support it. However, these opinions are subjective, as different individuals have different perspectives on self-defense. It is important to remember that CCW is not only for public protection but also for personal protection.\n\nIn conclusion, banning CCW is unjust as it only prevents legal gun owners from possessing firearms. CCW has proven to be effective in protecting lives, as demonstrated by numerous successful instances of self-defense.

So far, Con has failed to refute the following arguments.  -  Gun bans only prevents legal gun owners from possessing guns  R1: An imminent threat  Pro argues that it would be better for security to be maintained by trained law-enforcement professionals. He fails to show why it should \"only\" be maintained by law-enforcement. He also says students and staff should stay away from the campus till the threat is resolved. How are students supposed to get a warning of a danger? If a criminal brings in a gun into campus, they only have several minutes to react. They aren't given a 24 hours notice.  R2: 2nd Ammendment   Pro argues that certain people aren't allowed to carry a gun, and there are restrictions on the type of guns eople are allowed to own. This is completely irrelevant to my case. I'm arguing that CCW should be allowed. In order to be a CCW owner, you need to first pass all tests, and need to be qualified to own a gun in the first place. Also, all states allow the use of CCW.

{"basic": "Thank you, Con, for initiating this thought-provoking debate. I accept the challenge and wish you the best of luck. \n\nNow, let's address Con's main argument that abortion is murder. According to the definition of murder, it involves unlawfully killing a person, especially with malice aforethought. However, it is important to note that abortion is not considered murder if it is performed before 10 weeks, as the fetus does not have a heartbeat at that stage [2]. Therefore, it cannot be classified as killing a person, as the fetus is not yet alive.\n\nMoving on to my case, I would like to highlight the right to abortion. Section 1 of the 14th amendment clearly states that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law [3]. The term \"deprive\" means to deny a person or place the possession or use of something [4]. If a woman wishes to have an abortion, it is her right to do so because her body is her own property. The government cannot dictate what she should do with her body, as they guarantee these rights to all Americans.\n\nFurthermore, the well-being of the mother should be taken into consideration. Studies have shown that women who are denied abortions often suffer from long-term health and mental problems [5]. Denying them the right to make decisions about their own bodies leads to feelings of regret and anger, while those who have had abortions report feeling relief and happiness. By denying women the right to choose, the government is not only depriving them of their happiness but also causing them to live with regret and anger, which negatively impacts their overall well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, abortion should be considered a right because it is not murder if performed before 10 weeks, it is protected by the 14th amendment, and denying women the right to choose can have detrimental effects on their mental and physical health.", "len_basic": 1901, "len_orig": 2622, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "Thank you Pro for your rebuttal.

It is a blog, there is no proof that any of this happened at all, in fact, the link in point number two in this rebuttal could have been a lie for all I know, that is why I am not using it as solid evidence of anything. 4. Pro's point about the scam could really happen anywhere. There are scams all over the place, just because it happened in India doesn't mean it is a problem that there are call centers in India. Processors Pro, you should have dropped this topic because now you are defeating yourself even more. If my Toshiba has an i3 and your Mac has an i5, that doesn't mean Mac has better processors, it means I couldn't afford a computer with an i5 processor. In fact, it would seem that Mac tends to use the lower end of each processor in the Macbook Pro. For example, for $1200, the 13 inch Macbook Pro has a dual core i5 operating at 2.3 GHz [1]. The dual core i3 in my Toshiba laptop operates at the speed of 2.53 GHz and yet my computer was a mere $450. So the only valid processor argument is about who uses the better version of the type of processor, not who has the better types of processors. Pro used the latter which is a moot point, and I used the first which would seem to be a much more valid argument. Security This was a comparison of the fully upgraded models on release date.

Here is the definition of concern we will be following: Concern: to make (someone) worried : to cause concern for (someone) In the comments, my opponent said this: \"Population as a broad subject is not a concern. But you may have well as already won if you just need to prove that population has concerned people before. Guess I fell for this trap. Ill give it my best.\" We both agree that if I prove that population is a concern to someone, I win. It wasn't really a trap, but rather what I believe. That being said, on to the arguments! Humans are concerned by population: Upon the fact that my opponent and I agree with the same terms, I will start out by showing you that at least one person is concerned by the population problem. On our very own site, an opionion question asked if any think that overpopulation is a global crisis. [2]. 81% responded by saying yes, and explaining why it concerns them. Therefoe, my point that at least one human is concerned by population is proved. This is a rather weak starting point, but it actually does prove what the resolution says. I will now go on to say why humans should be concerned by this, rather than who is concerned by this. Why we should be concerned: For this standpoint, I will turn to environmental issues. As we all know, most things in life are limited. And recources and environment are one of them. Without trees or food or water, the human race, nor any other animal, would ever be able to survive. The human race is slowly depriving our planet of natural resources. We are putting a ton of carbon dioxide out there, and it is only going to get worse as the population increases. Studies show that the carbon levels have risen 32% from 1750 to today, with 60% taking place in the 1960's-current time [3]. Carbon makes the air very unhealthy and almost unbreathable. As for resources, it is freakin' scary. The U.S contributes to almost 40% of all resource depletions. If everyone lived like a normal American, we would need FIVE EARTHS [4] to support the population. And since we are trying to give people better homes to live in, the amount of people living like an American will go up by a lot. Also, there are 310 million people in the U.S compared to just 90 million a century ago [5]. That is about a 3.2x increase over a century and is probably only going to get higher. So there is why you should be concerned. The future looks bleak... In the future, the population will rise. Projections about the population in the future are mind-boggiling. In 2050, we will have about 9 BILLION people occupying the earth [6]. In just 35 years, our population will rise about two billion people. We are already pushing Earth past its tipping point. Furthermore, the U.N projects above 10 billion people in 2062 [8]. Here's a chart to further understand the population growth [G1]: Please note that this graph was taken in 2000, so there are more than 5.8 billion people on the planet today.

However, I will continue with my opening points. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * Feminism is based around equal power distribution between the sexes, not supremacy. Feminism makes the claim that there is a hierarchy that exists that is tilted in favor of men, this is called patriarchy. Feminism means to abolish this social hierarchy in favor of gender equality between the sexes, not the supremacy of one sex. This alone is clarified in the definition of the term, and anyone who strays from this term (such as radical 'feminists' like TERFs) is by definition not a feminist, nor do they under any circumstance represent feminism. Saying such is equivalent to me saying, since one person in the state of Louisiana is a member of the Ku Klux Klan, then all people in Louisiana are members of the Ku Klux Klan. Saying that all feminists seek to harm men is baseless. Purporting that feminism ignores issues like domestic violence against men, or non-recognition of female on male rape (both of which are issues that MRAs like to throw around, but do nothing about) is also baseless. Patriarchy and imbalance of power between the sexes (and imbalance of power between classes) is what causes these instances, and is exactly what feminism is opposed to. I will rebuttal my opponents opening argument claims in the second round. I hope we can have an intelligent and meaningful debate."}, {"effective_argument": "In the rules for the debate, Con stated that definitional games were not allowed. I stated I would hold him to that, and it appears I will need to do so. First, Con argues genetics. It is important to note that he does not refute that according to the dictionary, the definition of an egg depends on parentage. This makes the argumentation irrelevant. The genetics of the situation isn't in dispute. The terminology is. According to con, \"Since a chicken is a mutant Hybrid Junglefowl, and the egg is a mutant Hybrid Junglefowl egg, the egg is actually a chicken egg.\" This argument wins Con the point that the mutant-Hybrid-egg is the genetic equivalent of a chicken egg. However, the debate hinges on whether that egg should be described in relation to the Hybrid Junglefowl or the Chicken. If the egg in question should be described as a chicken egg that came from a Hybrid Junglefowl, the debate should go to Con. If the egg in question should be described as a Hybrid Junglefowl egg that grows into a chicken, the debate should go to Pro. Con did not dispute the fact that eggs are described in terms of the animal that produces them, instead choosing to argue that eggs are the genetic equivalent of the animal they grow into. This is true, but not a point under contention. Regardless of whether an egg will hatch and be considered a different species, regardless of whether it's genetically equivalent to a different species than the parent, the parent's species, by definition, determines how the egg is described and this was not disputed by Con. You must accept Pro's definition argument since Con passed his chance to challenge it. Thus, the egg of a Hybrid Junglefowl is still a Hybrid Junglefowl egg, even if it's genetically equivalent to a chicken. It was a dropped point that the descriptor is determined by parentage, not genetic makeup, thus the progression is still Hybrid Junglefowl -> Hybrid Junglefowl Egg -> Chicken -> Chicken Egg and the Chicken still comes before the chicken egg. To address Con's 2 arguments: the first is a perversion of the classic problem and should be dismissed under Con's own rules he stipulated in the OP. The second is simply a rehash of the above discussion, that the descriptor of an egg, whether it is a chicken egg or a hybrid junglefowl egg, is defined by parentage, not genetics. In summary: Con did not dispute that the definition of an egg depends on parentage not genetics, thus a chicken egg can only exist when a chicken has laid it, thus the chicken comes first. Con did not use in-line citations and so it is impossible to ascertain which of his links support which of his arguments.

First Past the Post allows minority rule. 66% of the UK population did not vote for its elected MP. Only one government in the past 100 years has had more than 50% support. Is that really democracy in 2011? 2. MPs need not appeal to a broad spectrum of people. As they can get in with as little as say 25% or 30% of the popular vote, they need only try to convince a minority of voters to come out in their support. 3. First Past the Post is characterised by elections being decided in only a handful of marginal constituencies. That means hundreds of thousands of peoples votes are practically worthless. Is that really 'one person, one vote?' 4. FPTP causes apathy. Why would you vote if there was no hope of your party winning? Why Alternative Vote (AV) is preferable. ____________________________________________________________________ 1. An example: 3 candidates are running for election and you are a voter. Mr Blue - you love him, but there's not much chance him winning Mr Green - you hate him, and really hope he doesn't win! Mr Red - You'd prefer him over Mr Green, but he's not your 1st choice. With First Past the Post, you'd have to choose between potentially wasting your vote on Mr Blue (As he stands so little a chance), or not voting for Mr Blue despite him being your favourite, and instead tactically voting for Mr Red. With Alternative Vote, you can vote in preference orer: 1. Mr Blue 2. Mr Red. when the results are counted in the first round, Mr Blue is disqualified as he has received the fewest votes. people who voted for him then have their 2nd choices redistributed. And then, in the final round of counting, this produces a candidate who receives the broadest support from the electorate. Candidates have to get a majority to be elected, they have to aim for 50% of the vote. If in the first count, a candidate acheives 50%,then they are automatically elected. If no-one acheives 50%, then process above begins. It is FAIR, DEMOCRATIC & produces candidates who better REPRESENT their constituents. After all, the whole point of a regional MP is to be representative.

{"basic": "Refutation: The argument that a woman should not have the right to choose abortion because she can place the baby up for adoption is flawed. While adoption is an option, it is not a decision that should be forced upon a woman. It is her body and her choice. Additionally, suggesting that a woman who chose to have sex and became pregnant should not have the right to terminate the pregnancy is unfair and ignores the complexities of individual circumstances.\n\nDefense 1: The analogy comparing a fetus to a person who has killed ten people is not valid. A fetus is not a fully formed human being and does not possess the same rights as a person who has committed heinous crimes. It is important to recognize the difference between a potential life and an actual life.\n\nDefense 2: The question of why a mother should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy is better framed as why should a woman be forced to carry a pregnancy to term if it does not align with her desires or circumstances. It is not fair to expect a woman to endure the physical, emotional, and financial burdens of pregnancy and childbirth if she does not wish to do so. The fetus's presence is a result of the woman's choices, but that does not negate her right to make decisions about her own body.\n\nDefense 3: While the argument suggests that the state's role is to ensure society functions perfectly, it is not the state's place to dictate what a woman should do with her body. The value of a woman's life and her contributions to society should not be used as a basis for denying her reproductive rights. Each individual should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own body and future.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument against legalizing partial-birth abortion based on a woman's property rights and the value of her life is flawed. It fails to consider the complexities of individual circumstances and the importance of bodily autonomy.

The Bible also says that we are to pray according to his will 1 John 5:14 \"And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.\" There's a difference between believing in what the Bible says and trusting in God to fulfill what he says.

However, this argument fails to consider the complexities and personal circumstances that may lead a woman to choose abortion.\n\nFirstly, it is important to recognize that not all women have access to contraceptives or may have had a contraceptive failure. Additionally, even with the use of contraceptives, there is still a chance of pregnancy. It is unfair to place the blame solely on the woman for choosing to have sex when there are multiple factors at play.\n\nFurthermore, the argument assumes that a woman who has gone through 22 weeks of pregnancy will not be hurt by delivering the baby. This is a gross oversimplification of the physical, emotional, and financial toll that pregnancy and childbirth can have on a woman. It is not our place to dictate what a woman should or should not be able to handle.\n\nAdditionally, the argument prioritizes the rights of the fetus over the rights of the woman.

Of course, Pro may have meant countries when he said regions, but that doesn't change the fact that that isn't what the word regions means. \"He neglects the example of Michigan, that wins me the round given the argument provided by Con. To disambiguate the issue; regions and nations are non-distinct in this debate. I'm Pro my ability to create a 4-color map, not a random arrangement of shapes that are independent as soon as their borders end.\" Pro's example means nothing, unless you first accept his assumption that regions means the same thing as countries or states. \"The reason there is a distinction is because countries can be split and discontinuous, as opposed to polygons and geometric figures, which can not.\" There is a distinction in Pro's mind, but not in what was written during R1, which is what counts. He defined 'Four Color Theorem' to mean a specific thing, and failed to prove that he had disproved that specific thing. If he had said countries in his initial definition, which he could have, he would be right. But he didn't. \"Furthermore, it only makes sense realistically to assume that regions don't have to be coninuous for the sake of this debate given the fact that all maps keep discontinuous nations/states the same color anyways. E.g. Michigan, the US/Alaska/Hawaii, Pacific Islands, etc.\" No, this assumption does not make sense. One cannot just assume that you meant something that you did not actually say. If Pro's intention was really to show your claim was true of countries, rather than regions, he could have simply said so. His actual intention was to be deliberately deceptive, by saying something that he knew was different from what he meant. In conclusion, if Pro had meant countries when he said regions, he could have said so. He did not. Because he defined the four color theorem to mean a certain thing, his burden of proof was to show that he had a valid counter example to what he actually defined , not what he secretly meant by what the words in R1 said.

It makes it difficult for voters and goes beyond the rules of the debate. Arguments not answered 1) Was the sample from the WTC chemical signature analysis? I am not lying, regarding the resignation of Prof Pileni. The resignation was due to the fact that the manuscript was published without permission. (1) This is the same newspaper source cited in the first round and my opponent keeps denying. Here is a translation to help the voters and my opponent. \"\" I resign as the editor in chief,\" was the succinct answer in an email to videnskab.dk. Printed without permission A phone call reveals that the chief Marie-Paule Pileni never been informed that the article would be published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal, which is published by journal juggernaut Bentham Science Publishers. \"They have printed the article without my authorization else, so when you wrote to me, I had no idea that the article was published. I can not accept, and therefore I have written to Bentham that I resign from all activities with them, \"says Marie-Paule Pileni. \" My opponent has conceded the chain of custody point. The fact that it is extreme circumstances is not a reason to doubt the validity of the chain of custody argument. Pro also states nano thermite can only be made in one or two laboratories in the world. This is false as any nano-lab anywhere in the world can produce nano thermite as can be seen in the publication history of nano-thermite manuscripts. Please do a simple Google scholar search for nano thermite. Con rightfully points out the difference between the grey and red layers. However, this casts in doubt as to what was been analyzed in the studies and whether the compositions of iron and aluminum calculated using EDS are correct. The correct method would have been to separate the layers, then purify them and then analyze them independent of each other. This is a failure of the experimentalists and casts massive doubt on the results. Regarding the use of EDS, EDS is a surface measurement and as such does not measure the total content of the sample. As such it is usually used only for preliminary analysis, structural analysis and not complete elemental analysis. This is due to analysis peaks overlapping, scattering of electrons and adsorption of electrons by the sample.(2,3) These two reasons are why I doubt the ratios found as stated in my round 2 argument. Pro has said Figure 14s extra peaks are due to surface contamination. This does not explain why this similar contamination was not found on the other samples in figure 7. Please elaborate further as this is from the same sample set and again casts huge doubt on the analysis employed. The fact that Al and Si are inherent in minerals on earth and not thermite manufactured in the lab proves that this material could be natural and not manufactured in a lab. To counter this Pro cam up with the following argument. \"Con must come up with a reaction that reduces iron(III) oxide forming iron spheres that does not include a thermitic reaction. \" Pro maybe does not understand that iron oxide can be easily reduced to multiple forms in multiple ways, even spheres.(4-6) The fact that spheres formed is irrelevant as this does not prove thermite, this only proves the reduction of iron.

Ready when you are."}, {"effective_argument": "Time for rebuttals! You said: \"When a women has an abortion, she is removing only a clump of cells from her body ( I am opposed abortion after 6 months ). Should the government force her to birth what is technically a parasite in her body?\"(emphasis added) I mentioned in my opening statement that just because a fetus is a \"bunch of cells\" does not make it any more or less human. In fact all humans could be called, \"just a bunch of cells\" for that is what we are made up of. I'm not sure what definition of parasite you are using but it's certainly not a technical one. A parasite is an organism that lives on or in another organism of another species(1). An unborn baby or fetus is dependent on the mother for the first stages of life, just as any other mammal. To be technical a fetus is a mammal not a parasite. The government is not \"forcing\" anything upon the woman. Prolife does not take away a woman's choice to not have a baby. The woman has full freedom over her sexual behavior. She has freedom to choose whether or not she has a baby before conception. Prolife promotes responsibility for the choices the mother has already made and protects the human life she is now responsible for. You said: \"yet if you do believe that a fetus is a human...\"(emphasis added) It's not a matter of believe, it's a matter of scientific fact(2). I mentioned this in my opening case. You cannot claim that an unborn is not human because it is less developed. Is an adult more human than a baby? Of course not! That's discriminatory. Why should it be any different for an unborn baby? You said you are against abortion after 6 months. Why should a baby of 6 months be more valuable then that of 5 or of 1 day? Did you know that at 4 months a baby has developed reflexes and can even suck their thumb?(3) Did you know that by the 8th week a baby can feel pain?(4) If an organism can feel pain it must have a level of self-awareness. But neither of these facts make the fetus any more or less \"human\". To discriminate against a living human being because of their age or physical development is not right. Why should it be okay inside the womb they are most vulnerable? You said: \"nor does the fetus have the right to use another humans organs without his/her permission\" The fetus did not invade the mother or choose to live inside her. These choices were made by the mother. The mother chose to have sex at the right time of the month, without proper contraception. The mother chose to create life, not the child. Why should the human life who was created by the choices of the mother then be neglected and killed? The choices of the mother are permission enough. It's her very own doing! You said: \"Childbirth is the 6th leading cause, causing over 200,000 deaths in 2013...\" Yes, but abortion has killed even more lives! Some 1.06 million abortions were performed in 2011 in the US alone!(5) .Your reasoning rests on the idea that a mothers life is worth more then her baby's. Again, this is a discriminatory notion. The mother and baby both have equal value as human beings. You said: \"..putting a baby up for adoption costs a lot more money than an abortion, usually around 3,500$-7,000$\" Adoption can certainly be expensive, but whether it's a viable solution does not build a case that abortion is not murder. Many times aborting the unborn baby would make life easier for the mother, this does not change whether abortion kills an innocent life and is therefore murder. We need to support mothers in difficult situations from unplanned pregnancies. In a recent letter to my federal member of parliament, I raised the issue of more support for our single mums. We need to support single mums, not teach them to kill an innocent life to make it better. (1) <URL>... (2) <URL>... ... (3) <URL>... (4) <URL>...

While my opponent argues that there are already numerous other colliders, they fail to acknowledge that these colliders may not be big or powerful enough to conduct the necessary experiments. Additionally, renowned physicist Prof. Hawking has expressed skepticism about the LHC's potential, further supporting my argument. My opponent claims that there are no identifiable spin-offs from the LHC, but fails to provide any evidence to support this claim. In fact, the development of the Internet by scientists at NASA and CERN is a clear example of a spin-off from scientific research. While my opponent argues that the Internet is unrelated to the LHC, it is important to note that the Internet was based on existing technology and was privately funded, unlike the LHC. Although it may be difficult to quantify the social and economic benefits of the LHC at this stage, it does not mean that there won't be any. It is unfair to expect the taxpayer to bear the burden of funding the LHC without any quantifiable gain. However, it is important to recognize that major inventions and advancements that have improved life for humanity have often been funded by the private sector. The lack of private sector interest in funding the LHC raises questions about its potential benefits.

However, my opponent in definition is wrong. \"Is\" doesn't mean just one. It is open to interpretation, but it could also mean that on balance (which is a how a debate should be decided) that U.S. has done more harm than good in their process of intervention. Chile First off I never said we helped set up a dictatorship, so I am confused as to what my opponent is talking about? Also, my opponent's own source works against him. Let me post some experts from it. CIA actively supported the military Junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency. In fact, many CIA officers shared broader US reservations about Pinochet's single-minded pursuit of power. Evidence s that the government had not supported Pinochet's Rise of Power, and actually discouraged it IE reservations. In the 1960s and the early 1970s, as part of the US Government policy to try to influence events in Chile, the CIA undertook specific covert action projects in Chile. Those hereby acknowledged are described below. The overwhelming objective--firmly rooted in the policy of the period--was to discredit Marxist-leaning political leaders, especially Dr. Salvador Allende, and to strengthen and encourage their civilian and military opponents to prevent them from assuming power. These actions, as stated by Lannans source, were to prevent a dictatorship from growing. Kyrgyzstan The things that my opponent lists as \"bad\" intervention, are false. \"rationing water\" for example. We were giving water to a country that was already lacking it. They wouldn't have had the water had we not been there to give it to them. We ration it so we can distribute it equally among them. Also my opponents claim of us \"ousting\" a leader because he is Muslim, is false, and not backed up by any source, meaning we must drop this point. Middle East We didn't \"help cause 9/11\" by funding them. You realize that 9/11 was caused by two terrorists driving a plane right? This required no more resources than two human beings with access to an airplane to be able to take over these flights. Any of our support towards Al-Queda, had nothing to do with 9/11. Terrorists made a choice, and by that choice, Americans suffered. We didn't cause this by trying to help out other countries. Rockets Arguments Argument 1: Dropped. Argument 2: U.S's protecting the value of it's citizens, why not others? How do we hurt their citizens? My opponent fails to explain this. Human Rights meets the definition that Lannan provided in R1. The basic rights and freedoms to which all humans are considered to be entitled, often held to include the rights to life, liberty, equality, and a fair trial, freedom from slavery and torture, and freedom of thought and expression. (3) This means, by my opponents own argument, that all humans are defined by the same rights. By protecting these rights, they aren't different from our own rights at all. Argument 3: Dropped. Sources: My opponent says wikipedia isn't a \"credible source\". He fails to explain why however. That information in the source, is readily available on other websites, meaning the information still holds true. What my opponent should have done if he wanted to attack my sources, would be to point out something within them that is wrong or flawed. He didn't do this, so we must assume the information within them still holds true. Also one of your sources comes from a blog, made up of someone's own take on U.S. intervention, lacking a source of it's own. How is that any better than wikipedia? Conclusion I feel I have won this debate for the following reasons: 1. My opponent's own sources basically refute his arguments. 2. My opponent has dropped two of my arguments. 3. My opponent has breached conduct multiple times; setting up the debate on unfair principles without my agreeing to it, and Forfeiting a round, and posting his real sources only in the final round giving me only one round to debate his actual arguments... 4. Giving false information in his arguments and presenting them as fact.

Why shouldn't we kill? Yes it is depriving of life, but without Moral Reasons who is to say life is valuable? Many Laws are based in Morality. We as a society have accepted that it is wrong to kill, A MORAL choice.\" Because we have named, murder, rape, and burglary as against the law. Not necessarily wrong, but harming other non-consensually is against the law. It is all that I want my government to defend me from, non-consensual harm. As I see it, this is one of the major points in the round, Why is Non-Consensual Harm Bad? This seems to be derived the the Moral right of Autonomy. So why is Non-consensual harm bad? because it is Wrong. Protection may not be a moral reason but what we protect IS based in morals. without any conception of morals then nothing is wrong, because nothing is wrong, everything must be right. Thus if everything is right that laws cannot exist. \"Look, your arguing the exact way I asked you not to. Were still mainly talking about what laws are morals and what laws aren't. But, I named the specific laws I wanted us to just state as not morals, or excepted as the only moral laws we count as not being morals (reasons we should allow the government to defend us from, whether or not they are moral doesn't matter) What your arguing is an ENTIRELY different debate. Because I want to talk about \"forcing your beliefs onto me, when there is no need too\" Yes I told you could debate differently, but I specifically asked you not to debate this way.\" The agreement was made that I would not argue protection as a Moral Concept, This is pretty clearly stated in round one.... I have never said that Protection was a moral concept, I merely argued that Pure Morals are the reason for all laws even if you discard some of the examples as outside of where I agreed to argue, the main premise of my side still remains, the resolution asks us is laws should be made for moral reasons, And I say any law has Pure Moral reasons behind it. Here is one solid example of laws made for pure Moral reasons, equality. Why is equality important? the simple answer is because each person has the same moral worth, and deserves the same rights. Human Rights are another, Why do humans have these basic rights? without the human right of liberty nobody could be non-consensually taken of their right to liberty as it was simply not a right. The reason they cannot is Pure Morality. \"I don't care what they are founded on, today they shouldn't be looked as as moral rights, they should be looked on as rights we want our government to give us and everyone else.\" Look what the resolution is asking us, \"Are Pure Moral reasons enough to form laws?\" Not to sustain laws, The Human Rights that are now legally protected were formed from PURE MORAL REASONS. 'Pushing your morals onto me through the law, when what I am doing is not non-consensually harming someone, isn't fair because their is no reason to do it, and we should be allowed to follow our own moral beliefs\" You ignored this argument, and had an entire debate on a technicality I asked you specifically not to have it on, one that you agreed you wouldn't have it on. But, you did anyways.\" I did not debate a technicality, I did not Attempt to say that protection was a pure moral reason as I was asked not to, the core of my argument was essentially(to sum this up quickly) that all laws are not based upon protection but upon right and wrong, The Law against killing exists because it is wrong to kill, this is an instinctive moral value that most humans have but is nevertheless a PURE MORAL REASON."}], "ideology": "Argument: The LHC is unnecessary as there are already numerous other colliders.

The question arises: should we or shouldn't we allow euthanasia? This is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and examination of various perspectives. On one hand, proponents argue that euthanasia provides a compassionate option for individuals suffering from incurable illnesses or unbearable pain. They believe that it is a matter of personal autonomy and the right to die with dignity. On the other hand, opponents raise concerns about the potential for abuse and the slippery slope that legalizing euthanasia may create. They argue that it is ethically and morally wrong to intentionally end a person's life, regardless of the circumstances. Ultimately, the decision to allow euthanasia should be made with great caution, taking into account the values and beliefs of society as a whole. It is a matter that requires thoughtful deliberation and consideration of the potential consequences.", "len_basic": 1036, "len_orig": 128, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "My opponent continues to believe that protectionism will save America from the clutches of the recession, but nothing could be further from the truth. Contrary to my opponent's judgement, I do not believe that American consumers \"have pools of wealth that are diminished solely by the costs of consumption.\" I agree that Americans depend on their income to fulfill basic necessities, but trade with China will not end this stream of revenue. My opponent has not yet truly shown that trade is as deadly as he seems to believe. There are two main ways in which trade is beneficial to the American economy: first, workers depend on this trade. Many American jobs exist solely because of this trade. A study by Morgan-Stanley found in 2007 that, \"...four to eight million American jobs are closely associated with trade with China... Chinese exports have saved American consumers $600 billion over the past decade and nearly $100 billion alone in 2004...\" [1]. Restricting or even eliminating this trade, as my opponent continues to advocate, would only serve to hurt the millions of workers whose livelihood depends on trade with China. Second of all, many companies depend on this trade. The Congressional Research Service found in 2007 that, \"...low-cost imports [from China especially] have benefited US firms that use them as inputs for the production of other goods, thus making those firms more competitive\" [2]. It does not make sense to implement tariffs when trade with China actually keeps many companies afloat. My opponent expresses concern with regard to maintaining income sources, and that is exactly what trade has done, does, and will continue to do. My opponent next asserts that trade is not mutually beneficial, that China is gaining from American losses in this situation. However, this simply does not make sense, and my opponent does not adequately back up his claims. He states simply that, \"...the supposition that trade provides mutual benefit has been disproven throughout history.\" His source for this succinct statement is a Wikipedia article on the Opium Wars, a conflict between Britain and China that occurred in the mid-1800s. I would appreciate it if my opponent would shed some light on how this pertains to trade issues. Despite his clams, trade is a positive occurrence for both the US and China. Morgan Stanley reports that, \"...business and trade relations have ... contributed to the growth... of... [both American and Chinese] economies\" [1]. The Heritage Foundation agrees, and cites a 2003 study by Michael W. Klein, Scott Schuh, and Robert K. Triest, which \"...shows the benefits of trade outweighing its costs by 100 percent\" [3]. When the US voluntarily buys products from China, or any nation, the results bolster both economies. This kind of economic activity will be necessary to end the recession. My opponent argues that China is working to end unfair labor practices only because it has the wealth to do so, and that American corporations are attempting to slow this process. However, we must disregard the current policy positions of companies, and look to the underlying factors that have allowed China to become as wealthy as it is today. Without American trade to improve China's economic status, that country would not have the wealth necessary to spur policy decisions moving towards a level playing field. The \"forces of free trade\" that my opponent frowns upon are actually the reason for the policy movements that China is experiencing today. My opponent and I agree that tariffs on Chinese goods would likely start a trade conflict, as happened in the great depression with the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Act, but he denies that this would hurt the US economy. He asserts that we would not have that much to lose if we cut off all trade with China, or even if we cut off all trade with nations that utilize unfair labor practices. China may not have been very important to the US economically when the Smoot-Hawley act was passed. But today, China is America's third largest export market, [4] and provides valuable revenue that aids the US economy - especially in this period of economic turmoil. We need all the help we can get to end this recession, so it makes no sense to risk losing trade with such a large nation as China. My opponent is proposing that we regulate, restrict, and risk losing trade not only with China, but with many other countries as well. What he overlooks is that this trade helps both American workers and companies, is beneficial to both China and the US, and will encourage fair labor policies around the globe. By imposing tariffs on Chinese products entering the US, we will only risk losing an important and valuable trade partner. In these troubling economic times, we cannot afford to suffer such a loss.

This is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and examination of various perspectives.\n\nFor those with a conservative political ideology, the sanctity of life is of utmost importance. They believe that every life is valuable and should be protected at all costs. Allowing euthanasia may be seen as a violation of this principle, as it involves intentionally ending a life. Conservatives argue that there are alternative ways to alleviate pain and suffering, such as palliative care and hospice services, which prioritize the preservation of life while providing comfort and support to individuals facing terminal illnesses.\n\nFurthermore, conservatives may express concerns about the potential for abuse and misuse of euthanasia laws. They worry that legalizing euthanasia could lead to a slippery slope, where the criteria for eligibility may expand over time, ultimately resulting in the involuntary euthanasia of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or disabled. This raises ethical and moral dilemmas that conservatives find deeply troubling.\n\nIn addition, conservatives may argue that the focus should be on improving access to quality healthcare and pain management, rather than resorting to euthanasia as a solution. They believe that investing in medical advancements and compassionate care can provide individuals with the support they need during their final stages of life, without compromising the sanctity of life.\n\nIn conclusion, for those with a conservative political ideology, the question of whether or not to allow euthanasia is a complex and deeply personal one.

Yankee Stadium was called \"the house that Ruth built\", but it was more like the house built for Ruth. The right field line was only 295 ft away from home plate. Ruth, a lefty, was able to hit home runs over the short right field fence. Right field was nicknamed \"Ruthville\" due to amount of home runs hit there. Nowadays a fence that short would not be allowed. Babe Ruth played in an era where more runs were being scored per game than before and ever after. In 1919, when Babe Ruth played his first hundred game season, the home runs hits/allowed jumped from .09 to .21. It continued to rise through his career all the way to .54 when he retired in 1935. This was not due to Babe Ruth alone. The Dead Ball Era ended in 1919. OBP, BA (batting average), hits, and runs all increased throughout the league. The amount of home runs went from 96 in 1918 up to 240 in1919. Babe Ruth's batting average high during the Dead Ball Era was only .325. He hit 20 home runs in his 5 years of hitting in the Dead Ball Era. <URL>... . Another interesting thing was on Baseball-reference.com's elorater (which is voted by fans) of the 10 all time best batters, 4 not including Ruth played while Ruth played. I'm not sure why but it raises questions about Ruth and the era he was hitting in. Many pitches had been banned in 1919 crippling pitchers who relied on them including some all-time greats. Was Ruth just a product of an era that was increasingly becoming more hitter friendly? Pitching In the years when Ruth pitched for Boston the average ERA for the league was 1914-2.73 1915-2.93 1916-2.82 1917-2.66 1918-2.77 1919-3.22. Ruth's ERA during this time was 2.19. Yes it is better than league average but an ERA of 2 was not as good as it is today. Last year's average ERA was 4.08. When he was pitching, pitchers were pitching more games and throwing more pitches. The example of Clemens season doesn't work. If Clemens put up the same numbers back then it would not be seen as a amazing season. Fielding is often overlooked when judging a player. Babe Ruth committed 83 errors while playing in right field. That puts him at 19 on the all time errors for a right fielder. That means of all right fielders ever only 18 have committed more errors. <URL>... And when you look at the amount of putouts he ranks only 50 of all time RF with 2205 compared to the leader with 4807 in the same amount of years that Ruth played. <URL>... Babe is also ranked 26 in amount of assists. With 120 compared to the record of 256. <URL>... When it comes to hitting he was good but he wasn't the greatest. Let's compare Ruth to his team mate Lou Gehrig. I will use their 162 game averages to make it easier and simpler to compare. This makes it easier to compare players that played different amounts of seasons. <URL>... Runs- Ruth 141, Gehrig 141. Hits- Ruth 186, Gehrig 204 RBI's- Ruth 143, Gehrig 149 Batting Average-Ruth .342, Gehrig .340 Total bases-Ruth 375, Gehrig 379 SO%(SO/plate appearances)- Ruth 13%, Gehrig 8.2% Runs created-Ruth 176, Gehrig 167 Ruth and Gehrig played the in same years as team mates. As you can see their stats are similar. So Ruth at the time was not dominating the game. Ruth's numbers were not so dominant that they are the greatest. The year he set the record of 60 HR in a season, Lou Gehrig hit 47 HR. Gehrig outhit Ruth (.373 to .356) and almost matched him in on-base percentage (.474 to .486), and slugging (.765 to .772). Gehrig led in extra base hits (117 to 97), total bases (447 to 417), and RBIs (175 to 164). Gehrig led the league in doubles, was second in triples, second in home runs, second in hits, and third in batting average. Ruth set records but many of them have been broken. <URL>... , <URL>... My opponent says \"Babe was always personable and friendly with others\", but he did many inappropriate and irresponsible things during his career. -He ate and drank to excess. Ruth often frequented prostitutes. -Fought fans during games. -He broke his toe after kicking a bench due to being walked. -He constantly argued with umpires/challenged them to fights. -Punched an umpire after walking a hitter in four pitches. Also threw dirt in another umpires face for calling him out. -feigned exhaustion or a sore arm to avoid pitching, wanting to hit. -Quit team because he wanted to hit more. -Refused team rules on curfew. -\"I didn't mean to hit the umpire with the dirt, but I did mean to hit that bastard in the stands\" <URL>... The link my opponent said of the polls ranking him at number one leads here. <URL>... As you can see Ruth was not so dominating at his sport. You have to take in to account all parts of the game. Many people forget that when judging players. Babe Ruth was not the total package. When talking about a five tool player, ( <URL>... speed, arm strength, fielding ability, hit for power, hit for contact) Babe Ruth had only 2 of those.

The United States has a vast supply of coal, and by using it, we are saving taxpayers millions of dollars. It is important to prioritize addressing other major sources of pollution before switching from coal to an alternative. Switching from oil to natural gas, for example, would have a greater impact on reducing pollution. Furthermore, if we can introduce techniques, like the one used by Ohio State University, to make coal less harmful to the environment, it would be a more practical solution than transitioning to a completely different energy source. It is worth noting that coal has been the nation's staple of energy since its discovery, and without it, we would need to find alternative options that are currently ineffective and expensive.

That is probably the best that can be offered in opposition to my claim. I don't live in that world. My Atheism 101 argument has been designed for use in our world to test our world's rational thinking and a fundamental claim common to atheists. In our world, where reason is more commonly respected, my opponent effectively concedes this Step #1 debate with the following: > Using propositional logic, > the argument would be valid. It's not simply an invocation of \"propositional logic\", \"propositional logic\", \"propositional logic\" by which my position might be endorsed. It's simple, common-sense reasoning.

Otherwise, I'd like to see someone come forth for the exercise that doesn't struggle so with Step #1 and can agree with me and reasonably and easily explain the basis for his/her agreement without all the gamesmanship. My opponent further opines: > You must be expecting an argument > presented using some alternative > system of logic. I'm expecting an open, honest, reasonable discussion of the claims I make for the argument. The goal is not to play games with alternative, speculative, irrational systems but rather determine if my argument is so constructed that if its premises are true its conclusion will follow as true therefrom (i.e., without regard to whether or not you've got some label to pin on it). My argument has the following referenced form, and it can be, by the exercise of reason, determined that the following is true: > If it is the case that \"if (A), then (B)\" is true, > > and > > if it is the case that \"(A)\" is true, > > then it will will be the case that \"(B)\" is true. If that statement be true, and I think it is, and if it describes the form of my argument, and I think it does, then one may be reasonably conclude, and I do, that my argument is so constructed that if its premises are true its conclusion will follow as true therefrom (i.e., it is logically valid)."}, {"effective_argument": "Thank you for your rebuttals. First off, my opponent states that a teacher monitoring computer use is an issue of trust. However, my opponent fails to point out the possibility of cyber crime. Wouldn't it be trustworthy for a teacher to watch a student's computer to prevent them being a victim of cyber crime, especially if they're younger children? Younger children may not be fully aware of these things so could require extra monitoring as they would be more vulnerable as a result. Secondly, my opponent mentions that a teacher may watch a student's computer outside of school hours. This is highly unlikely as that isn't the teacher's responsibility. The student isn't in school so can have free time to do whatever they want online.

{"basic": "Argument: My opponent's failure to respond allows me to address a comment made in the comment section. Firstly, I must question the validity of comparing the intelligence of comments to that of a pineapple. Such a comparison seems rather absurd and does not contribute to the discussion at hand. Moving on, it is important to clarify that smoking outside, in the open air, does not infringe on someone's health unless they choose to stand in close proximity to the smoker. The impact of cigarette smoke in open spaces is often diminished and does not pose a significant risk to others. It is worth noting that there are other pollutants in the air that are far more dangerous than cigarette smoke, yet there is no widespread call to ban automobiles or factories. To illustrate this point, consider the following experiment: standing in an enclosed garage with 50 smokers for half an hour may cause discomfort and slight dizziness, but it would not have a significant long-term impact on health. On the other hand, standing in the same enclosed garage with a running automobile for the same duration would result in severe health consequences, potentially even death. Therefore, it is clear that automobiles pose a greater danger to society than smoking. Furthermore, it is important to address the issue of obesity, which is a far more serious health concern than smoking. Contrary to my opponent's claim that obesity only affects the individual, the reality is that treating the effects of obesity requires a significant amount of tax dollars. The financial burden of obesity-related healthcare far outweighs that of smoking-related healthcare. It is crucial to acknowledge this issue, even though it may be uncomfortable to discuss due to the prevalence of obesity in our society. Lastly, it is worth noting that the debate topic specifically focuses on public smoking, not the broader issue of obesity and smoking.", "len_basic": 1917, "len_orig": 2010, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "I would like to take this opportunity to thank my opponent once again for engaging in such an interesting debate with me. I wish him the best of luck during the voting period. First of all, I apologize if I exaggerated my opponent's position. I understand that he does not truly believe free trade to be \"deadly.\" I will refute his other claims pertaining to assumptions and conflation later in this round. My opponent states that I have made an exaggeration about the extent of wage reduction because of trade with China. Excuse me. However, my point still stands, free trade will cause neither income annihilation nor wage reduction. Contrary to my opponent's allegation's, the US can both encourage economic growth and free trade at the same time. As I have already shown, our societal values will not necessarily change simply because China commits unfair practices and we trade with China. My opponent has asserted that there is a difference between a job that is closely associated with trade from China, and a job that depends on trade with China. Beyond this, though, he does not make any real distinctions between the two. Let's look at it this way. If there are two businesses in a small town, and they are said to be closely associated with one another (that is, the success of one is linked to the success of the other and vice versa), the two establishments clearly depend on one another. The same is true of the millions of American jobs that are closely associated to trade with China. They depend on this trade. My opponent next brings up the idea that trade with China has cost the US 2 million jobs. he specifically targets outsourcing techniques, the process of moving American jobs overseas. Though I agree that this may be true, the statistic he references here is a gross statistic, not a net figure. This mean that he is not accounting for the number of jobs that have been created by the economic growth that this trade has encouraged. If we look to a 2005 study by the economic forecasting company Global Insight, we can see that, \"\"[Outsourcing] lowers costs, frees domestic resources to pursue other productive ends . . . and increases labor productivity . . . These benefits flow through to lower prices, lower interest rates, and higher spending throughout the economy. . . . Increased economic activity creates a wide range of new jobs . . . over time, the U.S. economy operates more efficiently, [produces more], creates more than twice the number of jobs than are displaced, and increases the average real wage\" [1]. This same study found that, for example, outsourcing had created more than 257,000 net new American jobs in 2005 alone. Obviously, this movement of jobs only encourages economic growth and in the long term is highly beneficial. Again, excuse me if I misrepresented my opponent's position. My opponent seems to recognize that trade is mutually beneficial, but he then goes on to say that it has been proven not to be. I am somewhat confused by this contradiction. he then cites the Opium Wars and the Slave trade, stating that they are examples of when free trade has failed. However, the Opium Wars occurred because Britain was smuggling opium past Chinese borders, despite Chinese restrictions on drugs. This shows that restrictions and tariffs cause trade conflict. In the example of the Slave Trade, Europeans and Americans forced Africans into slavery. China is doing nothing that serious to America, so this example should be disregarded. Furthermore, trade restrictions could hardly have prevented slavery. My opponent also claims that I simply repeat the assertion that trade is mutually beneficial. I would like to point out that I had several sources to back this up; it is in no way an empty claim. Even if China has committed unfair labor practices, these would not have made that country rich on their own. China needed one more ingredient to become wealthy: trade with the US. Without trade, China would still be poor and underdeveloped, ad have an enormous incentive to continue using unfair policies. Now that free trade has allowed for Chinese growth, China can afford to level the playing field. My opponent next moves away from economic impacts and asserts that free trade, because it has allowed China to grow, will elevate China to the status of a superpower, and allow China to spread oppression. However, as China grows, it will be able to integrate itself into the global capitalist system, and will have a motive to decrease oppression and allow justice to reign. A developed China will be a free China. We are already starting to see this in Chinese trade practices. Free trade is important not only to the US economy, but to the entire world. Tariffs will only hinder economic growth and development. Please vote in negation. [1] <URL>... ."}, {"effective_argument": "First I thank Pro for this entertaining debate. She's offered a good perspective of her side and brought up points I hadn't thought of, though she apparently forgot to run the spell check in her last round. Its still been a good clash. In compliance with tournament rules the last round is a conclusion. I'm keeping this under 4000 characters and ask my opponent to do the same. I'm gonna make this easy for the judges and just state the main points you should vote on. 1. Vote on universal timeline Remember the argument I brought up last round, that after 10^40 years, all nucleons will have decayed. Nucleons make up almost everything in the universe. With no nucleons there will literally be nothing except you and black holes. Because our immortal must live 10^100 years, that equates to 10^60 years you have to live, with essentially nothing. No Internet, no electricity, no nothing. My opponent says that it wont be all bad because we can actually go into one of those black holes and see whats inside them. This is probably the strangest argument I've ever seen. First off, the gravity inside a black hole is so strong that you would literally be immobilized the second you entered and would never be able to move again due to the gravity weighing you down. Second, seeing whats inside a black hole would only fascinate you for so long. After a few days you'd want to leave, but you couldn't because the gravity is too strong. Seriously, voluntarily going into a black hole makes no sense. This means there's really nothing for you to do for 60% of your \"lifespan\". A universe with no sustainable objects puts a new meaning into sensory deprivation. 10^60 means 10 with 60 zero's added onto it. Thats how many years an immortal would have to live with basically nothing in the universe. Prefer mortality. Its not even close. 2. Vote on human extinction Her argument for immortality that she introduced in R1 is entirely predicated on humans being around. She's conceded that an immortal will live so long that life with humans will equal .000000001% of their life. This is extremely negligible, making Pro's benefits minuscule. Pro also straw man's my Memory argument. I never said the immortal would forget life with humans due to psychological memory problems (or amnesia). I said that they just might naturally forget over time. Just as we all probably forgot what happened on our 5th birthday party, because it was so long ago. We forget things all the time. This is no different. Finally, she says that if an immortal isn't motivated to maintain energy sources (like electricity) by themselves. then they just don't want it enough. This is absurd. An immortal is going to want electricity. They'll want the internet. They'll want sources of entertainment. But look back at all the things I listed last round, that are necessary to keep things like electricity, when all other humans die out. No one would be motivated to do all those things no matter how much they wanted to keep energy sources. The fact is that we need other humans around to keep our electricity running, to keep our cars working, and to keep updating our iPods. When they finally go extinct, someone who lives forever will not have access to these and will not be able to do the abundance of tasks necessary to maintain them. Its common sense. 3. Vote on planetary destruction Pro drops my argument that we may not develop advanced space travel before earth is destroyed. This is huge. If Earth were to collide with another planet, be torn up in a nuke war, or be hit by an asteroid, she cannot guarantee that an immortal would be able to escape the devastation. The most likely scenario is that because they wouldn't die in the explosion, they'd simply be thrust into space where they would float meaninglessly for who knows how long, before they run into another celestial body. Which probably is nothing like Earth, and likely is just a large barren rock, on which life is pretty meaningless. Immortality has short term benefits but is not worth it in the long run."}], "ideology": "Argument: As my opponent has failed to respond, I will address a comment made in the comment section.

The premises go like this: 1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause. 2) The universe began to exist. 3) The universe had an (uncaused) cause. [1] The argument is in a logically valid Modus ponens. [2] If everything that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, then it logically follows that the universe had a cause. The only issue with this argument is the truth of the premises. Therefore, I will attempt to demonstrate the premises to be true. Premise one is based on the Principle of Sufficient Reason.[3] The Principle of Sufficient Reason is a philosophical principle postulating that everything must have a reason for its coming into being. I think that there are very good epistemological reasons to accept the PSR as true. How would we practice science if things came into being without any cause? Science is predicated on the idea that there are explanations for why things happen, and we should go out and discover the cause of why it happened. It's deeply anti-scientific to suggest that things can begin to exist without reason. [4] There are three major explanations for the origin of the universe. The universe came from nothing [5], the universe existed eternally [6], and the universe had an absolute beginning [7]. The hypothesis that the universe had an absolute beginning is the most convincing of these three, so premise two is upheld. Let's investigate the three hypothesis and their plausibility. The universe couldn't have come from nothing. This is affirmed by the metaphysical principle ex nihilo nihil fit [8]. In English, this means ''Out of nothing, nothing comes''. There is no way for something that exists to come from a state of absolute nothingness. I'll give two arguments as to why this is true. Firstly, the potentiality argument. If there is a state of absolute nothingness, then there is no potential for anything to happen. If there is no potential for anything to happen, then there is no potential for a universe to come out of nothing. Therefore, it is impossible for the universe to have come from state of absolute nothingness. Secondly, the property argument. If you have absolute nothingness, then you have the universal negation of everything. Logically, you would then have the universal negation of all properties. But if something can come from nothing without cause, then that nothing does have a property. The property of something coming from it. By definition, something cannot come from an absolute nothingness, because then you never had an absolute nothing to begin with. An eternal universe would require an absolute beginning. Cosmologists have explored the mathematics of an eternal universe and concluded that it had a beginning. Even if the universe existed forever, it still began to exist, so the eternal universe hypothesis does not refute premise two. [9] All of the current astrophysical evidence demonstrates that the universe began to exist. On Steven Hawking's seventieth birthday, cosmologists gathered to discuss the current state of cosmology. Physicist Alexander Vilenkin concluded his speech by saying , ''All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning''. [10 ] There are also philosophical reasons to believe that the universe had a beginning. If the past existed eternally, then there would be an infinite number of events occurring before the present moment. If there were an infinite number of events occurring before the present moment, we would never reach the present moment. However, we have reached the present moment. Therefore, the past could not have existed eternally. [11] The cause of the universe beginning to exist is most plausibly god. The cause would exist before time, space, and matter, because it caused them to exist. The cause is, therefore, timeless, spaceless, and immaterial. The cause is most plausibly personal as well. I quote Apeiron, DDO geophysicist and philosopher: '' If you walk into your kitchen as ask, \"why is the kettle boiling?\" two types of explanations can be given but only one is sufficient - the first type is a scientific explanation: that the water is heated to a point where atoms speed up their collisions, etc. But the second explanation is a personal one in terms of will or volition, \"I wanted to make you tea.\" In some contexts it would be inappropriate to give one explanation over the other. Now the universe can't be given a scientific explanation since it's the cause of space and time we're talking about here, there's no spatio-temporal thing before or beyond space and time so it couldn't be accounted for in terms of laws operating on initial conditions. It can only be accounted for in terms of personal explanation in terms of volition, a personal explanation. '' [12] It's also important to note that something which can cause the universe to exist must be extremely powerful, which suggests omnipotence. In conclusion, the cosmological argument establishes a cause of the universe that is timeless, spaceless, immaterial, eternal, personal, and probably omnipotent. Using inference to the best conclusion, this cause is most likely god. Vale. References [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>... [5] <URL>... [6] <URL>... [7] <URL>... [8] <URL>...

To begin would be to mention a common counter argument which is that not teaching a child religion is the same as teaching them one. This is a fallacy because even if the parents are non religious people they are not demanding the child except some ultimate claim about the universe. If the parents are atheists they should not just say \"ok son you have to be an atheist\" just as a Muslim, Jew or Christian should not do the same. But by not passing down your religion to your child by indoctrination or force (force being I'll ground you if you do not go to church etc..) you are in no way acting as the opposite equivalent. I mention this first because I did not want to have to deal with the fallacy later wasting time. Now for an argument against. Well first of all this is in a great sense removing a persons right to religious freedom which has no age limitations. A parent does not have the right to make their child practice a religion. If a child refuses to go to church with them they do not have the right to punish them for not coming nor force them to in anyway. Would one let a Satanist parent force their child to go to a service? One could say 9 times out of 10 one would say no but we let other religions do it by the millions and think nothing of it even though it is the same thing. To continue this is indoctrination which keeps the child from being able to make decisions about religion in the future that are more thought out. No to say this makes someone stupid, NOT AT ALL, but you can understand the logical fallacy of saying I'll raise them Christian and then when they move out they can make up their mind about this stuff just fine. If a child is not forced to practice a certain religion while growing up this would allow them to critically evaluate religion rather than look at it through the lens of the religion they were made to believe. From my own experience (perhaps worthless) I was raised catholic and even when finally allowed to see religion for myself I found that I was making judgement about Islam, Judaism and non believing based on my own catholic beliefs rather than critically thinking about the claims/reasons for all this. It took me years to myself out of that hole so that I could view religions on a fair and logical basis. Yes I am atheist but I could have chosen any other religion. Plenty of people are raised without religion and later join one thus logical fallacy in saying you are taking religion away from the child forever. We do not label our children as Republican, Democrat etc why label them with religion and raise them so that they are forced to accept an ultimate truth they don't get to evaluate critically."}], "ideology": "Argument: In order for the argument to hold more validity, it is necessary to provide evidence that Democrats are actively working towards the destruction of America.

The Soviet Union might have won even without the help of the Western Allies. \"The dissolve of the Nazi German Economy was the major factor that lead to the downfall and ultimate defeat of Nazi Germany.\" And that was brought about by the Soviet Union, not the Western Allies. \"From late 1944 on, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945 (Stunde Null). Food became drastically scarce. Synthetic fuel production dropped by 86% in eight months, explosive output was reduced by 42% and the loss of tank output was 35%.[72] The Allied bombing campaign also tied up valuable manpower, with Albert Speer (Germany's Minister of Armaments) estimating that in the summer of 1944 between 200,000 and 300,000 men were permanently employed in repairing oil installations and placing oil production underground.\" Nobody doubts the damage done to Germany by Western Allied bombings. The bombings killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and destroying many factories and cities, one of the greatest crimes of WWII. The bombings however had no impact on the outcome of the war, just like D-Day had no impact on the outcome of the war. \"Also all together Nazi Germany had more troops then that of the USSR in 1944 and 1945.\" Completely false, you misread your source. In 1944 and 1945 the Soviets outnumbered the Germans heavily. \"If the western allies hadn't been there to distract the USSR would haven't had the ability or the power to get threw the defense of Nazi Germany.\" That is a possibility. However like you said, the Western Allies distracted Germany. They did not defeat Germany. \"The reason that the USSR was able to even push Germany back has to due with failure of re supplies; without that the Nazis would have even won the battle of Stalingrad.\" Completely untrue. The only reason Hitler lost in the east was because of Hitler's mistakes. \"All together the western allies made up a bigger force then that of the German western campaign.\" I would agree with you there. Overall, the western allies had more men than Germany, as did the Soviet Union. However this does not prove your point. \"The western allies also preformed operation torch which managed to cut of Germany from some precious fuels.\" Actually it was the oil in Romania that the Soviets captured which cut Germany off from fuel. There was no oil in Africa. Africa had no economic importance. Conclusion: Not only does Con use incorrect English, he has many incorrect facts. His strongest argument is that without the Western Allies the Soviets would definitely have lost. Not only is that untrue, the Soviets might still have won without the Western Allies, it is not an argument since without the Soviet Union, the Western Allies would most likely have lot."}], "ideology": "Argument: \n\nI.

Readers, please disregard the first two rounds. To the debate! I negate: McCain is not fit to be president. \"VOTING FOR MCCAIN IS ASKING FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF BUSH\" - This is a common talking point - you might as well say a campaign-driving catchphrase said as often as \"Change!\" and \"Hope!\" - of the Obama camp. Unfortunately, my opponent provides no support for this assertion in her argument, except a vague reference of how Bush and McCain have similar viewpoints on \"the Surge\" in Iraq and the military in general. Also unfortunate for her is that \"the Surge\" worked, at least ostensibly. <URL>... <URL>... I hasten to bring out the contrast of the politics of the newspapers The Wall Street Journal, known in the mainstream corporate media to be generally \"on the right,\" and The Washington Post, known to stand on the left of things. (Amazingly, both papers are able to have these slants and still be bastions of objectivity in the journalism world.) \"Nearly all of Senator McCain's ideas, plans, and morals are identical to those of President Bush.\" -Really? I see one plan, about the direction the country should take in the Iraq War, and no ideas or morals of any kind to compare. Because they agree on military strategy does not make them identical, no matter how many times the Obama campaign says it. As far as the wonderful statistics that you go on to cite are concerned, none of this makes McCain unfit to be president. Bush *is* the president, and he is responsible for the things in the first place. So there is the precedent that none of these things disqualifies one from being president, as Bush is still president, even after the fact. (As a sidenote: Shame on the Huffington Post. They totally ripped off Harper's magazine with the format that they presented their statistics in. Harper's should sue.) \"My guess is this does not help the economy. You think McCain would learn from his friend's mistakes, but apparently not. Let's not go there again. The people of our country need help now more than ever.\" - I assure you, Bush and McCain are not friends. Bush is simply a plain moron. McCain is actually an ok guy, in my opinion, that happened to get stuck with the legacy of Bush as the Republican nominee. \"Graduated next to last in his class, and spent his school years partying. Hmm... Good role model for America? Maybe not.\" - We are not electing a role-model, we are electing a president. Ergo, irrelevant. Funny pictures of Bush, vague statements with no factual backing, and irrelevant statistics do not make McCain unfit for office. Thanks to lenorenomore for posting, again. I wish time had been more readily available to you:) See you around the site. VOTE CON Britt -"}, {"effective_argument": "I would like to thank my opponent once again for accepting this debate and realizing that this is not so much of an attack on him as it is a challenge. 1. \"In 2005 alone, Border Patrol Agents encountered 773 attacks from smugglers trying to breach the U.S. border. In 2008 that number rose t 1,097, over 41%. Within the United States violence is encountered throughout all 50 states dealing with the distribution of Marijuana (I will be focusing on New York due to the amount of time it would take to collect all the information from each state). Marijuana distributors, particularly Jamaican posses, engage in violent crimes to protect their turf. Law enforcement agencies in Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse have reported an increase in drug-related violence resulting from an influx of Jamaican criminals who are challenging drug distribution areas long controlled by local marijuana distributors. Cannabis cultivation occasionally is associated with violent crime in New York. Typically, growers cultivate cannabis outdoors with booby traps situated among and around the plants. Reports indicate that traps closer to the cultivation site are more dangerous and sophisticated and target those who might steal the cannabis. Last time I checked, Anheuser Bush hasn't taken any shots at Marlboro.\" Here, I'm quoting the whole argument because first I would like to point out something about the sources cited. In the first source where you claim that \"figure 11\" has relevance to your argument, I can't find anything beneficial to your case or anything relevant. However, what I DO see is this: \"CIR data (Figure 8) show that deaths decreased steadily from a high of 344 in 1988 to a low of 171 in 1994.\" What I see this to be is an admittance of the deaths on the border decreasing by somewheres near 50% over a course of 6 years. **Also, all of these crimes that you refer to are crimes based upon the fact that Marijuana is illegal. For example, \"Typically, growers cultivate cannabis outdoors with booby traps situated among and around the plants.\" They wouldn't have to booby trap their crops if it was legal. 2. \"Dutch sales of cannabis alone totaled 1.2 billion euros ($1.86 billion) in 2001, according to the most recent figures available from the nation's statistics bureau. While in 2003 annual alcohol sales were $115.9 billion and tobacco sales were $333.4 million in 2001. I'm no mathematician but a combined sales of $449.3 billion compared to $1.86 billion is just a little bit higher, in fact its over 242% more in sales. \" I'm afraid your numbers are either old, wrong, or the fact that it was the Dutch sales makes it irrelevant. The fact is, that in California, \"A bill to tax and regulate marijuana in California like alcohol would generate nearly $1.4 billion in revenue for the cash-strapped state, according to an official analysis released Wednesday by tax officials.\" Marijuana on the streets isn't being taxed, therefore the revenue WOULD be considerably less. Keep in mind that this 1.4 billion dollars is only for the state of California, imagine the whole United States. [1] 3. \"Simply because it is being distributed illegally, how many drug dealers do you think are gonna pay there taxes for there marijuana sales. Excuse me kid, that will be $10.00 for the dime bag and oh, .70 cents for sales tax, have a nice day! Yea not happening sorry.\" I think the correct term you were looking for is THEIR Marijuana sales. In any case, there wouldn't be drug dealers selling Marijuana. It would be distributed mainly through stores. The sales tax would work just like buying cigarettes. 4. \"Gang violence related to the distribution of marijuana as I stated in #1.\" Gang's aren't the only people affiliated with Marijuana. The big gang raids and things of that nature tend to follow more important drugs, Cocaine in particular. Give me some facts of how gang violence is a factor in the distribution of Marijuana please. 5. \"As stated in #2, sales cant even begin to touch Alcohol or Tobacco alone, let alone added together. Hell McDonald's annual sales in 2008 was $28 billion.\" I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to say here. And I didn't say \"Hell McDonald's annual...\" I don't think you meant to include that as a part of my quoted argument, but you did. Voters, don't be confused. 6. \"Can't say this is exactly a factual assertion considering it is speculation based upon the Tobacco industry. As far as my standing on this, to say that there will be 200 Americans employed will be just as good as your \"factual assertion\" due to the fact that it is only speculation.\" \"All and all as you can tell through actual facts and numbers Marijuana sales taken from a country where it is actually legal and the sales are recorded, this would not \"strongly\" promote our economy or promote it anymore than Mcdonald's does. The legalization of Marijuana in the United States will have no strong or near strong promotion in our economy.\" I'm running short on time.

I don't worship Joseph Smith; I worship Them. Please do not tell me what I do or don't believe or what I practice. You have no right to do that. This argument was NOT about the integrity of Joseph Smith, it was about the fact that the LDS church is the closest to what Jesus established while he was here. The fact that you do not believe that God would encourage that violence within people only deepens my point that it was the Devil. Granted, the Devil takes joy in and fuels any sin, but why would he fuel sin and hatred toward a religion that encourages people to , as you say, \"blindly follow a person like Joseph Smith\"? Would the Devil not encourage that; seeing as it draws people away from God? My response to your question \"Why would God send someone after Jesus?\" is EXACTLY. God didn't send those evils after Jesus; the Devil did in order to destroy what was good and pure and drawing men closer to God and truth. As for baptism... The LDS church also believes that before you get baptized you must accept the meaning of it. You're not supposed to be baptized unless you understand the symbolic meaning of it. The LDS church *again* DOES worship Christ, our Savior, and God the Father; NONE ELSE! His word IS all that matters and the LDS church and I believe that. What does it say on the front of every Book of Mormon? Or have you not had the integrity to look? If not let me enlighten you. It states: The Book of Mormon- Another Testament of Christ. \"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.\" You have no right to condemn this book if you have never read it. That book, in no possible way could have been entirely made up and written by a 14 year old boy with a third grade education. I have read it many times and in no possible way is that book evil. The Bible states that \"by their fruits ye shall know them\"...and...\"an evil tree can not bring forth good fruit , neither can a good tree bring forth evil fruit\" just as mikelwallace stated below. I KNOW beyond any shadow of doubt that that book and Joseph Smith are not evil. God told us that he WOULD send another messenger to prepare the way for the Second Coming; look up Malachi 3:1 (KJV) and if that isn't enough I can always give more. Every prophet we have is a messenger of God, not just Joseph Smith, but every single one after up until the current prophet Gordon B. Hinkley. \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.\" (Amos 3:7 [KJV]). \"We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.\" I suggest that until you actually know and understand what you are talking about, you don't try to tell someone what they do or don't believe. To answer your question about why I go to church... I go because my Lord God and my Savior Jesus Christ commanded me to keep the Sabbath day holy by worshipping them. I go not to glorify myself, for my life is not really mine; it belongs and is devoted to God in every way. It is not for you to judge. You know me not, so don't pretend that you do. You know nothing about the LDS religion and yet you try to tell me what I believe. Your prejudice and lies cannot sway my beliefs, for I am in no way that simple minded."}], "ideology": "Argument: This is not just a policy debate; it is a discussion about the impact of single-sex schools on education.

The fact of the matter is, this was a trap debate unless you were planning on trying to see my argument from my point of view. This means you would have to at least pretend the Bible is true. You are in fact trying to strip my presuppositions away, and you do not even realize it. \"You're attempting to turn this debate into one about the existence of a god, whereas it is no such thing.\" I am not trying to do anything but prove a point. I will lose this debate unless you are will to examine facts through the eyes of a creationist; also know as being open minded. When an evolutionist looks at facts, what does he think? \"Oh, that is evidence of how, over millions of years, volcanos and other natural disasters formed the strata in the earths crust!\". When a Creationist looks at the very same evidence what doe HE think? \"Oh, that is evidence of how the great flood layed down all of the strata on earth in a matter of about one year!\" These are both theories attemtping to explain the origin of the strata layers, and they are both based on the same facts. We interprate these facts differently because I believe in the Bible, and you do not. The again, You have your own history/science books that you would refer to in order to try and explain the same thing. It mfollows then, that we cannot debate facts, rather we have to debate how we interprate these facts. Thus, the debate would come down to the Bible, and me defending ITS credability. My burden then, in order to prove creationism as a theory, is to show how the Bible is consistent with science. I have no desire to debate the existence of God. I will now defend creationism as a theory. \"...there is no experimental evidence which suggests that we were created by an omnipotent power.\" There is no \"expirimental\" evidence that the Big Bang ever took place either, yet that is accepted as atheory. A theory is just that; a theory. There is no completely solid evidence that points to it certainly, but there is plenty of evidence that suggests that it is possible. \"The supernatural cannot be tested by the natural. All attempts to do so have failed.\" Once again, you cannot \"test\" the Big Bang theory, yet it is accepted as a theory. The Big Bang theory is LARGLY speculation, and nothing more, while the Creation theory actually has a book to back it up. A book that proves historically accurate. ( <URL>... ) \"Predictive\" I have not the slightest clue what you are talking about when you say: \"nothing can be predicted with intelligent design because it is the assertion that everything that currently is, always was. Nothing is gained at all, and it makes no predictions about our natural world.\". If you could clearify, I will glady refute. If you can look through the eyes of a creationist for even one moment, you will see how it is easily accepable as a theory. Everyone may not accept it as a correct theory, but it still has enough behind it to support it at LEAST. I would also like to comment on your statements concerning Answers In Genesis. 1) What classifies as an \"unbiased\" source to you? Does the simple fact that it is a Christian website lable it as \"biased? This is ridiculous. If that is the case, than I hadbetter not see any eolutionist post a link to talkorgins.com again. I mean come on, thats such a biased source... 2) What are you talking about when you say the author is just going by is opinion? He is stating facts. Look them up for yourself (but be sure not to use one of your biased evolutionist sites). 3) It is utterly ridiculous to make a claim like \"The author has done no studies, and has no scientific experience what so ever\" without evidence to back it. If you are going to make such a claim, you had better do a good job of backing it. After all, you have cited nothing, and are therefore going on personal opinion :) 4) It takes INTENSE studies and very in-depth research to make a strong case for one or the other.

I am proud of him. My opponent has clarified the debate: \"When the university steals software what does that say to the students?\" Therefore, I am now assuming that it is a debate saying if the faculty has stolen software, then the students should not be able to go to the tournament. 1. My opponent has agreed with the notion that punishing the one's responsible instead of the whole University, except for a certain type of situation. My opponent has brought up a point that governments of some third world and develping countries steal software and are not held responsible because of the government, etc. However, my opponent has also gave the proper solution to that issue, too. \"The United States finally came to their senses and began trade embargos, and other types of isolation tactics that have resulted in the current cooperation, and the intended de-listing from the countries that sponsor terrorism.\" This is in essance the correct way to pressure such countries into signing onto the international copyright laws, which make this illegal. Countries that sign and do not enforce these laws will face the economic burden of an embargo. And this, as opposed to preventing students of the world from participating in this prominent debate, is another way to properly resolve this issue. There are other ways to resolve this issue other than punishing the group, as my opponent has conceded. 2. My opponent seems to be arguing my case. \"The government concedes to the opposition that some of the students will suffer, but you must ask the question, good for the many, or good for the few? There are three teams, comprised of two debaters a-piece, on average, that competing universities will send to Cork Worlds Debate 2009. If a university has 10,000 students, and only ten of them can't go, please explain how the other 9,990 students will suffer? Even better than that, who many students at that university would even know that a debate club exists?\" The topic is whether the University, which is a body of students, should be excluded from a prominent debate tournament because people on the team were stealing software. My opponent seems to think that only ten of these students woud not be able to attend should the resolution stand. However, should the resolution stand, it would be the whole student body that would not be able to go shoud the resolution stand. It would be, \"...and none of them can go\". In addition, my opponent is arguing my case: \"Debate is not something that every single student participates in, and the message that not being allowed to attend the most prestigious debate event, in the world, would certainly register on the radar of the same people stealing the software, financing the debate club, and running the university. For these reasons, the opposition's second point fails!\" Exactly! There is a great chance that this punishment would not effect those guilty, but those those innocent. The debate team would suffer and it is unfair to them when they are not the one's responsible. My second point stands and has been conceded. To my opponent's points: \"As I clearly stated in my opening arguments, this debate is about universities that continue to violate the rules after they have been found guilty, and should be excluded from a prestigious event like the Cork worlds 2009 in an attempt to change their behavior.\" Yes, this is the debate. As my points stand, there are other ways to punish the University and this particular proposal is harmful to the students. So, my opponent's arguments against stealing: \"The job of a university is to educate its students. That education includes good morals and ethics. When the university steals software what does that say to the students? It says that stealing is ok! What happens to a society that teaches its students that stealing is ok?\" This stand is void to my opponent's case because we agree that stealing is harmful to society and the world. However, this does not defend the resolution. \"The economic impact is incalculable. Let's ask ourselves some commonsense questions. If one country teaches its students that stealing software is wrong, and another country teaches them that it is ok, which one is more likely to steal software? Stolen software hurts the manufactures, and can lead to massive layoffs as a consequence.\" Same here as above. \"For these reasons, the government's case stands strong!\" Those reasons did not support your case, they supported both cases and they are neutral arguments. The proposal that a University be banned from this prominent debate is an improper way to punish thieves and is not the best way to punish software pirates. For these reasons, you should vote CON."}, {"effective_argument": "My opponent gives quotes from two Founding Fathers, again without citing. I have cited my source for why Benjamin Franklin was a Deist. I have also pointed out that the Founding Fathers used Christian dialogue as a political method, which my opponent drops.

For example, President Obama was almost not elected based on the mere rumor that he was Muslim, despite his professing to be a Christian on numerous occasions [1, 2, 3]. My opponent did not cite her/his arguments, but we can certainly assume that there was good reason for Benjamin Franklin to have spoken as if he were a Christian. The quote from George Washington only states that relgious ought to use the Bible as a moral text, much like an ethical textbook. This does not mean that Washington supported a Theocracy, or even an official religion. Even if Washington and Franklin were Christian (no sources remember), that still doesn't matter. My opponent dropped the important arguments, like: 1. The United States isn't a Theocracy 2. The United States claim to be the first nation without an official religion. 3. The Constitution does not allow people to take a religion test to be elected (meaning that non-Christians were officially as welcome a Christians). My opponent dropped all of those arguments. Let me also add that neither the Constitution of the United States nor the Constitutions of any states nor the Declaration of Independence nor other official United States documents claimed to support Jesus Christ specifically.

I hope this has made him a bigger fan! Why Pro Can't Win Before I recap my case and address Pro's new argument, allow me to briefly explain how Pro has sabotaged himself in this debate. In Round 1, Pro laid out two contentions meant to prove Batman is a positive role model: Batman is a good guy and he works where the police can't. Last round, however, he dropped both of these contentions and focused only on attacking my case. In doing so, perhaps unintentionally or perhaps as a result of my rebuttals, Pro just conceded the only affirmative arguments in favor of the resolution. Without these arguments, Pro cannot prove Batman to be a positive role model, he can only hope to negate my case. In other words, Pro made it impossible to affirm the resolution. He can't win. What Pro Has Conceded The following list compiles the points that Pro conceded to in this debate. Combined or separate, they clearly paint the picture of what society would deem a \"bad\" role model. Not only are his motives and actions not to be applauded, but if they were emulated, the physical, emotional, social, and legal ramifications would be devastating: Batman is a career criminal, committing literally thousands of offences, ranging from theft to attempted murder. Batman exhibits an extremely aggressive, sociopathic, self-destructive mentality. Batman has raised and trained a half-dozen teens and pre-teens for battle, leading many to death, disability, and/or serious psychological trauma. Batman's so-called \"good deeds\" are always the result of illegal and highly dangerous methods. Batman regularly interferes with and inhibits police operations in his own city. Pro's New Argument Pro makes two claims here. First, he states that my arguments cannot be understood by youths and thus should not be considered. However, as I explained last round, my arguments - Batman breaks the law, is crazy, and hurts kids - could not be more straightforward and universally understood. One does not need to understand the sociological implications of renegade justice to know that it's not okay to beat people up or run from the police, nor does one need a masters in psychology to know that it's not normal to live in a cave all alone for the rest of your life. Also, notice that Pro doesn't mention Batman's child abuse AT ALL. Could it be because there is nothing more obviously bad to kids than ABUSING KIDS? Pro's second claim is really his downfall. He states that because kids think Batman is a positive role model, he is a positive role model. However, Pro already conceded that Batman's crimes, sociopathy, and child abuse make him a negative role model. He just proved those kids wrong! Batman is a role model alright, but simply being admired does not mean he is worthy of admiration. Kids might also think bullies are popular and strong or killers are cool and powerful, but that doesn't make their deeds positive. Pro says as much himself: \"The methods, while maybe more important to older viewers, are not important to the younger viewers, who are more likely to model their actions after someone they view as a role model.\" Those old enough to understand Batman's negative traits do not consider him a role model, and those too young to understand these traits are modeling negative actions without yet realizing it. That doesn't somehow make him a positive role model, it simply means the children have a bad role model. Summation So that's it. Pro conceded my entire case, his entire case, and presented a new and completely faulty argument in the last round. Batman is a negative role model. The resolution is negated. There's really nothing more to say, except... . . . . . . . . . ."}, {"effective_argument": "Let be ask you a few questions: Is pornography a sport? Is a prostitute an athlete? Is singing a sport?

A swimmer doesn't swim to entertain (In fact if I'm not watching someone of Michael Phelps' level I get quite bored viewing it) they swim to do a certain speed and earn medals. Dancing is like sex.

{"basic": "Argument: 1) As a Politician, there is a big distinction between experience and being a good politician. Obama is a good politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances, etc. Huckabee lacks these skills as we saw in Iowa. His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. New Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum. McCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST \"Washington\" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously, people don't mind good politicians with experience. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is going to be needed to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet inexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different.\n\n2) Position: Obviously, all Republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principal point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes. Here he is getting beat up on Meet the Press: <URL>... Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision: <URL>... There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a \"Christian leader\" he is? He has played the religion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has. I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows.\n\n3) Personability: Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about a public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, cannot seem to make his points clearly, dodges questions, and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES. In any debate or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM. Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or not) and can cogently explain himself and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous religious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different). Huckabee has proven to us that he does not have the political wherewithal to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarrassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likable is part of the problem. That's all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other Republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run.

I never argued that huge exceptions should be made for every rule. I said that no set of rules was absolutely perfect and so sometimes, personal judgement needs to be used and the occasional exception allowed.

Here's one particular quote, \" Im trying to derail it [Hitchslap flame war thread] with humor but nobody seems to notice, deleting it is a good move in my opinion.\" Imabench has even made proposals for how to help DDO get more votes for debates (an issue that has been a pain to counter for almost a year now), a proposal that is actually very likely to be implemented. And all of this? Just in the last week . b) Pro has listed some negative things that he has done, but has not shown how they've \"harmed\" the site. Can he show that he's chased any distinguished members of the site? Can he show where he's trolled any debates started by senior members? Most of his \"troll debates\" are either, 1) Started by him (in which case, he is not trolling), or 2) Started by a new member that is showing an elevated level of ignorance with said debate. Many of his debates are like this one. <URL>... We can see that he lightly \"trolled\" it, but he presented complete and solid arguments and then just posted political satire pictures. c) Given how much Imabench helps with proposing new ideas for helping the site, and how he has not harmed DDO any more than a hair cut harms your head, there is no need for him to be rehabilitated, he is great just the way he is (I'm not hitting on him). Currently, he is just throwing out random sentences of extreme comments, not in an effort to actually harm any member, but in an attempt to portray himself differently than he really is for this debate. d) I've listed some, but not all, specific examples. e) My opponent claims that a moderator eliminated all those threads. However, moderators cannot eliminate threads, they can only close them (which they would still be visible). This is also highly illogical since DDO admins sometimes take sexual assault seriously (if pictures are not provided), as seen in this thread. <URL>... I myself was banned on the mere accusation of sexual assault. Yet we are to believe that accusations against Imabench will be ignored because he is \"funny\"?

Obama is a skilled politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances, and more. On the other hand, Huckabee lacks these skills, as we saw in Iowa. His campaign made several mistakes just days before the vote, such as swearing not to make negative ads but then showing the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. Additionally, Huckabee's performance in New Hampshire proves that his Iowa win was mainly due to the state's religious population. He finished a distant third in New Hampshire, even with his Iowa momentum. In contrast, McCain and Clinton, who are considered more \"Washington\" politicians, won in New Hampshire. This shows that people value experienced politicians. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your entire argument is based on. There are practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is needed to win the presidency, and Huckabee falls short in this regard. His campaign relies on trendy references and religious appeals, and if he didn't have his likable personality, he wouldn't even be considered as a candidate due to his weak political skills. This is not just because of his lack of experience, but also his lack of political skill. In contrast, Obama is politically savvy, despite being inexperienced and having a non-D.C. reputation, and is seen as a viable and electable candidate.\n\n2) Lack of Unique Stances: While all Republicans share most issues and stances, Huckabee does not have any unique or original views on major issues. He lacks originality and does not offer any new or unique plans. All candidates talk about energy diversification and independence, despite common conception. My main point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He struggles in debates and talk shows when it comes to issues other than religious or moral ones. This is evident in his handling of the Bhutto example and other policy decisions. Huckabee's ads focus on his \"Christian leader\" image because he lacks policy knowledge and skill. In Iowa, where religion played a significant role, this strategy worked. However, in New Hampshire, a less religious state, people recognized Huckabee's lack of political knowledge and skill. I did not mean to imply that he has no positions, but rather that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on issues unrelated to morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows.\n\n3) Lack of Articulation and Dodging Questions: Perhaps there is a misunderstanding on this point. When I refer to personability, I am not talking about being a confident and articulate public speaker. All politicians can do that. Huckabee, however, struggles to make his points clearly, often dodges questions, and fails to articulate himself on the issues.

This is evident if you watch him closely. \n\nIn conclusion, Huckabee's likability, honesty, and religious beliefs are not bad qualities in themselves.

Obama is a good politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances etc. Huckabee lacks these skills as we saw in Iowa. His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then, showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. New Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum. McCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST \"washington\" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously people don't mind good politicians with experience. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is going to be needed in order to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be being considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience, and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet unexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different. 2) Position Obviously all republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principle point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes. Here he is getting beat up on meet the press: <URL>... Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision: <URL>... There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a \"christian leader\" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has. I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows. 3) Personability Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES. In any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM. Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different). Huckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem.

His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then, showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience.  \n  \r\nNew Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum.  \n  \r\nMcCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST \"washington\" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously people don't mind good politicians with experience.  \n  \r\nThe assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well.  \n  \r\nThe point remains that a good politician is going to be needed in order to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be being considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience, and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet unexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different.  \n  \r\n2) Position  \n  \r\nObviously all republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principle point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes.  \n  \r\nHere he is getting beat up on meet the press:  \n  http://youtube.com...  \n  \r\nHere he is caught fumbling through another policy decision:  \n  http://youtube.com...  \n  \r\nThere are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a \"christian leader\" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has.  \n  \r\nI did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows.  \n  \r\n3) Personability  \n  \r\nMaybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES.  \n  \r\nIn any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM.  \n  \r\nFinally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different).  \n  \r\nHuckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem. Thats all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run.

You have no biblical argument against that, and if you want to discuss the validity of scripture, you should start another debate. Your thesis states that the Bible (which you apparently believe has no credibility) proves that Jesus was not God (never explicitly stated). The burden of proof is on you, not me. 3. Yes, it does. I gave you the passage in Philippians, which claims He emptied/humbled Himself. He had the ability to \"know\" or do things but declined to activate those abilities in order to show more of His human nature, which was a necessary part of the plan of redemption. 4.

I meant repeating all the arguments I have posed prior. I am not just going to type them all out again. 10. This makes no sense. You can always take the word of someone else and rip it out of context. It is no different with God. 11. Refer to the video. We know the 1 and 3 concept isn't mathematically sound.

This was my first debate and it was a lot of fun. 1. \"Banning can be used in the most severe cases\" This last punishment system you suggested would be problematic for the same reasons I explained previously. If members would be banned for forfeiting, let's say, 4 debates in a month, members suffering from an untimely internet loss, computer problem, family emergency, etc. could still be banned in a matter of days. There would be no special circumstances for \"severe cases\" under any of your proposed systems and well-intentioned debaters would be banned because of bad luck. Also, you have presented at least four different punishment systems at this point, uncovering another flaw in your premise: each method suggested is imperfect and will inevitably punish those who you admit do not deserve it. 2. \"Awareness is prevention\" You encourage a \"very public\" warning system that allows users to avoid debates with members who have marks against them. However, you do not explain how such a system would protect accidental forfeiters. Under your system, good debaters who have received warnings because of unavoidable time restraints would be marked, have difficulty finding willing debaters, and gain an unwarranted negative reputation on the site. 3. \"Opponents work get washed down the drain\" As I stated in Round 1, a forfeit does not mean one's research is wasted. You have won the debate using your research, you have expanded your knowledge on the subject, and you are free to debate the topic again using that same research. The quote of yours I posted in Round 1 supports this very statement. See my arguments there for elaboration. 4. \"The person who forfeits [has] all the rights\" This point was also addressed in Round 1. Forfeiters' statistics are lowered and their forfeits are clearly visible by selecting their losses (it took only moments for me to find and review the forfeited debates you mentioned). In addition, the social atmosphere of this site chastises those who do not debate properly. On the other hand, their opponents have increased their stats, developed their argument for a future debate, and have been spared the irritation of continuing a half-hearted debate with an uninterested opponent. -Closing- I have shown how a ban for forfeiters is not only a threat to all users but also completely unnecessary. My opponent has presented no solid case as to why his proposed system is either needed or beneficial. Pro has made no attempt to defend his original arguments, has failed to suggest a consistent punishment system, and has not even attempted to refute the reality that good users would inevitably be banned by his suggestion.

{"basic": "Argument: The notion that breasts are not sexual organs because they are not required for sex is flawed. While it is true that breasts are not directly involved in the act of sexual intercourse, they are still considered sexual organs due to their role in sexual attraction and arousal. The sexualization of breasts is deeply ingrained in our society and culture, and it is important to recognize and respect this. Therefore, it is not a matter of whether women should be required to cover their chests as much as men, but rather a matter of understanding and acknowledging the societal norms and expectations surrounding the sexualization of breasts.", "len_basic": 651, "len_orig": 148, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "This has been a fun and interesting debate, a great break in the tedium of spring break, and I would like to thank mongeese for that. \"Okay, mathematics, like physics, is a branch of science.\" I have two very important points to make here. First, the laws of physics can change, and second, my argument about unprovable areas in math was completely ignored. 1) Concerning the laws of physics. The laws of physics can change. Quite easily, actually. Now, we have evidence that certain particles, called 'force carriers' exist. These particles, as is evident from their names, carry the four forces in our world: the electromagnetic force, gravity (we're still searching for evidence for this force carrier), the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Respectively these are photons, gravitons (still hypothetical), gluons, and the W and Z bosons. Here's the crazy part: at temperatures in the universe today these particles exist together. However, we have reason to believe that at the beginning of the universe the four forces were all carried by a single particle. That is, instead of these five little particles running around mediating forces, we had one doing all their jobs. Also, forces diminish in strength with distance. Imagine that there was only one gigantic planet in the universe. As you get closer, you feel its gravitational pull more. But the further you get away, the weaker the pull. In our universe with three large spatial dimensions, gravity diminishes by a rule called the inverse square: 1/r^2, where 'r' is the distance from the object. So if I am 10 meters from the object, the force felt is 1/100 as strong. However, if our universe had only two large spatial dimensions, gravity would diminish by the rule 1/r. 10 meters away, gravity would be 1/10 as strong. This is only one example (electromagnetism follows the same rule) in which the laws of physics can change. 2)Areas which can neither be proved nor disproved. Mongeese does not address my argument on areas which can neither be disproved nor proved. The Continuum Hypothesis, for example physically cannot be proved nor disproved. If a set of over-arching laws existed, surely they would describe all of math. Mongeese's arguments necessitate the existence of a complete set of mathematical laws which we are moving closer to. However, such a set of laws which encompass all of math are impossible to achieve, which is demonstrated by such areas. If therefore no such set of laws exist, then math is something we are laying down for ourselves. To summarize the above two points, just because something is a science doesn't mean it has a set of always-existent laws, and even in fields where such laws exist, the laws are not unchangeable. \"Applied math, such as physics, is different from regular math, as you already said...\" I was noting that physics is pure mathematics which we have molded to describe the real world. We prove different things about infinity, adding to the laws of mathematics. \"The concept is just sitting out there, laughing at our mistakes, waiting for us to finally discover and prove what it really is\" The concept is constantly growing, like a silent sapling (also metaphorical). \"Math is both very abstract and very real\" And yet we develop areas of math without application in the real world. Fields like number theory which do not have bases in real world problems defy this argument. In conclusion, a set of over-arching mathematical laws cannot exist as there are areas which cannot be explained. Just because a study is a science does not mean it will have laws, and laws that are present can change. The laws of mathematics are changeable, and the resolution is CONfirmed (negated)."}, {"effective_argument": "Well Solarman, I see I'm once again marked a Stalinist, which again, proves my point.

Does this further make any intelligent point as to whether or not I am right or wrong? Absolutely not. This is my main point: Attacking the person does not add to the topic on hand. It is unnecessary, unneeded, and unwanted. There should never be any reason for a person's own integrity to come into question just because the topic is disagreeable to another individual. It does not matter who the person is that is saying it, all that matters is what they say. No one personally needs to be beat down simply for who they are.

I won't add anything else for my 4th and final round."}, {"effective_argument": "Same, just line by line. Some of it might be messy or repetitive due to how some of the arguments are fundamentally the same. Ok, the quote is dropped then. I will concede that a crime against humanity is \"murder or an inhumane act against a civilian\". Although I concede that the USfg should not be locked up in jail for killing soldiers, the definition still works against the affirmative. A \"crime against humanity\" is any inhumane act against a civilian. This inhumane act does not need to be on the governmental level, but on an individual level. By my opponents own definition places the foundation that a \"crime against humanity\" is anything bad that is \"inhumane\" against a civilian. As you can see, this definition is so very broad. There are hundreds of definitions of \"inhumane\", what does inhumane entail? Leaving one starving? A hate crime? Tripping someone when walking down the street can be classified as inhumane because the word itself is \"not-humane\". Dictionary.com says \"humane\" is defined as \"characterized by tenderness, compassion, and sympathy for people and animals\". Now I am not trying to stick the affirmative with having to prove every \"not compassionate\" act should be tried, but my point is simple. Inhumane acts occur all the time, every crime in the US can be defined as \"inhumane\"- even by his own definition. This would cause for the United States to have to give up its autonomous judicial system for even domestic crimes. We will have a world \"standard\" for what is a crime, and how to deal with that specific crime. Doing this on an international level strips every country of its own identity. Countries that have one predominant religious system will have to change their laws in order to conform to what the new \"international\" order says is ok. Even if the USA is not what chooses the punishment, the independence of the country is still taken. At this point, when the USA loses its individuality and merely conforms to a world order you cannot vote for the affirmative team. All of the laws worldwide will have to conform to what the \"consensus\" says is ok. Religions are different, some religions call for huge punishments on little crimes such as stealing. Succumbing to the international judicial system will violate those countries values, and strip us of our individualism. The first thing my opponent is going to say is that \"I am not advocating other countries to come into it also\" but at his arguments base, he is. His value criterion can only be accessed when the entire world is \"Equal\" onto the \"equal\" judicial system. So although he is not directly advocating for other countries to join, he cannot access his value or value criterion until he can prove why it is good for every country to be a part of the system. On his first contention- Yes, I agree that the US has not done a great job of punishing crimes against humanity. However, the policy that is needed is not one of giving up our individuality and succumbing to an international order if anything is to be done, we should change America at the individual level, not give in to other people standards. First- He says they cant make laws, only prosecute Second- No one country can lead the court Only providing two answers to this argument was a fatal flaw by the affirmative team. I concede they can only prosecute, but the way in which they prosecute will be based on western philosophy. The second point he makes is the last leg he stands on and really the only standing defense in the round. When I believe that you should have already made your decision based on the fact America will have no individual say and it will violate other countries religions, I will still defeat this to leave absolutely no doubt in your mind. However, even if I do not, the previous arguments are still enough to vote on. Onto his second point. (Pretty much the rest of the debate grouped) At this point he is standing behind the quote of Madeline Morris to defeat the logic that I presented. The problem is that the Morris quote does not even apply in a world post plan. She says that not one country has control, but you have to look to the fact that the countries involved now are just random countries with absolutely no pull in the world so of course 1 country does not have any more pull than another. When the hegemon United States of America steps in they will mold the decisions based on the United States values and nothing will change at all. He can say that safeguards are put in, but you have to look to the fact that the United States will be the ones catching the criminals, they will feel as if they have more pull then the other countries because they actually caused for the capture of the criminal. The record of the ICC is pretty horrible, they have only put out warrants for 12 arrests and only a couple have actually been tried. The United States will see that and think \"we are the one arresting everyone, we should try them based on what we say\" and then status-quo still happens. So if the United States, and the world, followed suit we would see no variation in the realm of judicial systems. This is bad. When you take this away religious standards are not met, and a country has no independence. Independent countries are needed in America because this stimulates competition between them all and moves society as a whole forward. Seeing that the affirmative calls for every country to be the same in their ethics calls for an immediate vote for the negative. When every single attack against a citizen must be taken to the international court, you have no alternative but to vote for the negative.

Further parallax measurements conducted since Bessel's time have consistently supported the notion that the Earth follows a closed path around the Sun.\n\nCounter-Response: It is worth addressing the misconception that we do not feel the movement of the Sun because we are on it. Similar to how we do not feel ourselves moving inside a car traveling at a constant speed, we do not perceive our movement on a planet moving at a constant speed. However, this does not imply that the Earth revolves around the Sun. As evidence, consider the experience of driving in a convertible at 60 MPH or any speed. In such situations, we can clearly feel the movement of the car due to the wind blowing at us. Yet, we do not experience this sensation on our planet because we do not move. The fact that we observe the Sun moving across our sky on a daily basis further supports the idea that the Sun revolves around the Earth.\n\nResponse: Firstly, it is important to note that using derogatory language such as \"retard\" is inappropriate and disrespectful. Secondly, I have provided evidence to support my argument. \n\nCounter-Response: My apologies for the inappropriate language used earlier.

Thus, the death penalty is too easy in this case. Bright-line: Proportionality Contention I: Use of Torture A. Physical Since the killer tortured their victims to an inconceivable amount, it is only just and appropriate to do the same thing to him. Using the death penalty is to easy and will only be a few seconds of pain, not even. That is no way proportionate to the harm he caused his victims. B.

For the second rule, no \"definitions\" of IT are allowed. I define a definition to be a concise explanation of the meaning of a word or phrase or symbol.

Well, perhaps not that last one so much, but you see the grammatical point I am making?

I remember not so long ago was out drinking in Aberdeen with a Chookter (someone from the hills surrounding the city) and an Irish fellow who was rather fond of his glass, if you see what I mean. Anyway, we had been in every pub and bar on Union Street and me and the local lad decided to call it a night because we'd all had a skinfull and, anyway, run out of cash. But Paddy was having none of it. \"No, no\" he said \"I'll lend you each a tenner and we'll get one more round in each\". So we went to the Hen Hoose for one, had one in The Bridge and ended up in The Grill, downing pints of heavy chased by double nips of single malt. Unfortunately, this did for poor old Paddy (the Irish are good drinkers but they can't keep up with the Scots or Geordies, like me) and he collapsed. We took him to the hospital but, sadly, he passed away as the result of alcohol poisoning. Me and the Chookter went to his funeral to say our goodbyes and I placed 10 in his coffin and said \"there's that tenner I owe you Paddy\". Then the Chookter came over, took the tenner out and replaced it with a cheque for 20 and said \"Aye, an' afar ye gaan an' caall m'athin, there's ma tenner aanall\"! Sorry, I digress. My opponent made a very good point about the airlines' policies. Most are not willing to insist the fat pay their fair share on planes because they don't want to be depicted as \"sizist\". One notable exception is Southwest Airlines, who have very clear policy on the matter: \"Why ask large Customers to purchase additional seating? We could no longer ignore complaints from Customers who traveled without full access to the seat purchased due to encroachment by a large seatmate whose body extended into the neighboring seat. These Customers had uncomfortable (and sometimes painful) travel experiences, and it is our responsibility to seek resolution to prevent this problem.\" <URL>...

The resulting being subsequently takes the name of Tuvix. A method of separating the two is later developed and Captain Janeway performs the process resulting in the demise or destruction of Tuvix and the restoration of Tuvok and Neelix. <URL>... Resolution Within the context of the story the destruction of Tuvix was murder. Definition of Murder: Killing that is unlawful and/or immoral. Contentions 1: Tuvix was a living, rational, sentient entity and as a result had a right to life. 2: Tuvix chose to live, and had the right to make this decision. 3: In choosing to separate Tuvix back into Tuvok and Neelix Captain Janeway assumes that she is protecting the rights of Tuvok and Neelix. However she assumes without evidence that this would be their desire, nor does she have the right to make such decisions. 4: Tuvix, is Tuvix and is Tuvok and is Neelix. As a result in the absence of a separate opinion from Tuvok and Neelix only Tuvok has the right to make life or death decisions concerning any of them. 5: Tuvix combined the abilities of both crew members, but would only require the resources and living space of one crew member in doing so he was far more efficient and useful than Tuvok and Neelix. 6: Though Tuvix was created by the 'deaths' of Tuvoc and Neelix he was not responsible for them, his death was therefore undeserved. 7: It is not morally permissible to kill one innocent person to save or restore to life two innocent people. If the killing of Tuvix was morally permissible, then it would be morally permissible to kill a single innocent person against their will to harvest their organs for a number of terminally ill patients. If the latter is immoral then so too is the former. 8: The ships Doctor refuses to perform the procedure as it is a violation of the Hippocratic oath and his ethical programming, thus it is clear that by the standards of the Federation this act is murder. NB: This debate purely concerns the moral dilemma within the context of the fictional story, rebuttals based on the massive plot holes and inconsistencies rife within Star Trek are not permissible. Thus it is not valid to point out discrepancies in the biology of Tuvix, the fact that Tuvix would not have been created, or the fact that it would have been possible, indeed far easier to restore Tuvok and Neelix without the destruction of Tuvix."}], "ideology": "The 150 armed protesters currently occupying the wildlife refuge in Oregon can be classified as domestic terrorists and should be treated as such.

{"basic": "Thank you for your swift reply. I agree with Con's point about war and national emergencies. As I mentioned in the first round, the Balanced Budget Amendment does provide provisions for such situations. Section 7 states that Congress may waive certain provisions of the amendment in fiscal years when the United States is engaged in a military conflict that poses an imminent and serious threat to national security, and is declared as such by three-fifths of the Members of each House of Congress. This waiver must be specific to the excess outlays necessitated by the identified military conflict [1]. \n\nAn objection that may arise is the concern that Congress could declare wars solely to create deficits. This is a valid point, and I believe there should be additional provisions in place. If the United States is not involved in any wars or national emergencies, then the proposed budget should be balanced.\n\nMoving on to Con's argument about recessions, my opponent suggests that government intervention is necessary to stimulate the economy and promote growth. However, historical evidence shows that government intervention can have unintended consequences. For example, FDR's New Deal prolonged the Great Depression, as research has shown that the recovery would have been much faster without government intervention [2]. The Wall Street Journal also highlights the unintended consequences of wholesale government intervention, such as artificially high wages and prices leading to prolonged economic depression [3]. Japan's experience with economic stimulus and government intervention also demonstrates the limitations of such measures, as their economy remained stagnant despite significant stimulus spending [4].\n\nRegarding Con's argument about Congress breaking amendments, I agree that this is a concerning issue. However, it does not logically follow that we should not have a Balanced Budget Amendment. If we were to apply my opponent's logic, we would essentially be advocating for a dictatorship with no constitution or bill of rights. This is not a desirable outcome for either myself or my opponent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Balanced Budget Amendment provides provisions for war and national emergencies, and additional safeguards can be implemented to prevent abuse. Government intervention in recessions has historically had unintended consequences, as seen in the case of the New Deal and Japan's economic stimulus efforts. While Congress may break amendments, this does not negate the need for a Balanced Budget Amendment.

In order to be able to host this site, Juggle needs to have enough traffic. It is in Juggles best interest to create new features that will bring in more people, without people the site dies. Adding a history category will bring in more people, that want to debate history. By spending more time on the site, and having more traffic, DDO would benefit from this change. Many people already in the DDO community say that they do want a history category to be added. 8 out of 17 (9 people said they did not support it) people said that they do want DDO to add a History category [1]. Out of the people who responded, 47%, almost half, support it. 47% is a large enough percent for Juggles to notice. If almost half (of the people who answered) and another 10%+ (of 17) people joined, then DDO would have that much more traffic which would benefit the DDO and Juggles profit. If about half the people (who responded) do want it, then it is only reasonable to add it, therefore Con's argument that people do not want a history category, is false. Expanding on my point I made last round, adding this new category would encourage more debates in a strict discipline (history). If someone wants to debate the scientific possibility of a god, they debate it in science not religion. If someone wants to have a debate strictly on \"actual evidence\" in a specific category, adding new ones makes it easier to create a debate that focuses on a single aspect of a wider subject. Con says that History has no relevance, which is an opinion which is largely biased. History has lots of practical applications, but that is not what is being debated. Conclusion: The DDO community and Juggles will benefit from adding a new category, History. Enough people have asked/supported it, therefore it should be added. Adding a new category would be relatively easy, and if the people who did not support it still oppose it, there is nothing stopping them from just ignoring it.

The Wall Street Journal also highlights the unintended consequences of wholesale government intervention, citing examples such as artificially high wages and prices during the 1930s and price controls in the 1970s leading to shortages [3]. Japan's experience with economic stimulus and government intervention further supports the argument against such measures. Despite passing multiple stimulus spending bills over eight years, Japan's economy remained stagnant, resulting in a significant national debt [4].\n\nRegarding Con's third point about Congress breaking amendments, I acknowledge that Congress does, unfortunately, violate amendments on occasion. However, this does not justify the absence of a balanced budget amendment. Following my opponent's logic, we would be left with a dictatorship without a constitution or bill of rights, which is not a desirable outcome for either of us.\n\nIn conclusion, the Balanced Budget Amendment provides provisions for war and national emergencies, and additional safeguards can be implemented to prevent abuse.

{"basic": "Argument: I would like to clarify that my previous statement was not referring to the most recent definition. I was specifically discussing the federal definition versus the state definition. Currently, the federal definition of marriage remains between a man and a woman. While it is true that a few states have legalized marriage between two individuals, the federal definition still stands. However, I believe it is important to move on from this point as it is not contributing to the overall discussion.\n\nRegarding gay rights, I want to emphasize that I am straight. However, I want to address the misconception that if someone were to become gay, their rights would change. In reality, there would be no change in rights whatsoever. We are not advocating for any special treatment. The right to marry is a fundamental right that everyone possesses, and it is not different for any individual. We all have the same rights in this regard.\n\nThere is a statement made that only pro-gay marriage individuals should be allowed to vote on the rights of gay Americans. However, I believe this is not a reasonable approach. In a democratic society, it is important to let the people decide on matters through the democratic process. Allowing only a specific group to vote on a particular topic goes against the principles of democracy. It is crucial to consider the majority opinion when making laws, as this is the foundation of our country.\n\nThe argument is made that denying people rights without compelling reasons goes against the idea of democracy. However, I disagree with this statement. Democracy is about creating laws based on the favor of the people. It is not about disregarding or disrespecting any particular values, including Christian values that our country was founded on. Just because someone may not agree with or find certain values relevant does not mean they should be dismissed. It is important to respect the diverse perspectives and beliefs of individuals.\n\nThe question is raised about what allowing gay marriage would cost. On the other hand, it is important to consider what not having it would cost the gay community. However, I believe this argument is shallow. Love between individuals should not be dependent on marriage. If someone needs marriage to love another person, then it may not truly be love in the first place.\n\nThere is a mention of New York City potentially making millions of dollars if they allowed gay marriages. While this claim is made, it would be beneficial to provide credible sources to support this statement.\n\nThe argument is made that gay Americans should be permitted the same rights as straight Americans, as anything less would be undemocratic. However, I question which rights we possess that gay individuals do not. The argument of equal rights lacks a basis, as we all have the same rights. Comparing it to the issue of marijuana legality, it is clear that the argument does not hold up. Smoking tobacco is legal for everyone, while smoking marijuana is illegal for everyone. It is not a matter of preference, but rather the legality of the substance.\n\nThe first reason given for why gay marriage should be allowed is that the rights of a minority should not be entrusted to the majority. However, I would like to see evidence that segregation was practiced and abolished based on majority and minority opinions. It is important to have accurate information before making such claims.\n\nRegarding the argument about marital benefits, it is important to note that difficult does not mean impossible. Same-sex marriage or civil unions can still provide those rights. \n\nIn summary, my arguments against gay marriage are as follows: \n1) Democracy should be based on the majority opinion, and laws should not be created that violate the will of the people.\n2) Allowing gay marriage could potentially open the door to other forms of marriage, such as polygamy, incest, and other sexual abnormalities.\n3) Gay marriage could diminish the value of marriage, which has been based on tradition, legal precedent, theology, and the support of the majority.\n4) Morals are not separate from human will, and defining morals is subjective.\n5) The advent of legally sanctioned gay unions in Scandinavian countries has already had negative effects on the institution of marriage, leading to an increase in single-parent homes.\n6) Marriage is not necessary for love, and removing marriage from the equation would not change the meaning of love between individuals.\n7) Allowing gay marriage could lead to a revamping of sex-education systems and potentially open the door to other controversial issues.\n8) Opposite-sex marriage benefits can still be provided through civil unions or opposite-sex marriage, making the argument for gay marriage benefits void.\n\nThese are my arguments against gay marriage.", "len_basic": 4843, "len_orig": 5655, "examples": [{"effective_argument": "Goodness gracious, it's always the same sh!t.

Furthermore, his links to \"Physics\", \"Logic\", \"Reason\", and \"Contradiction\" are just meaningless citations. Each of those terms involve a large field of study and his reference was brief. Thus, these do not count as sources for his argument because they in no way contribute to it. Second, my opponent's argument is flawed. Essentially, my opponent counters my argument in that he is a god that defies logic and nature. 1. Even if that were the case, he would only prove that he is *a* god, not necessarily that he is *my* god. I comprehend and conceive of things through logic.

However, his argument was an illogical one because it necessitates meta-physical realities. Thus, he has no good counterargument whereas I have one under the confines of logic. 3. I do not have a god. Possession is an attribute that follows existence, thus, my opponent must prove that he as a god exists before he can show that he is also my god. He has done neither.

It is not different for anybody, and we all deserve equal rights.\n\nThere is a statement that suggests only those who support gay marriage should be allowed to vote on the issue. While this may seem reasonable, it goes against the principles of democracy. In a democratic society, the people have the right to decide on important matters, including the definition of marriage. It is not fair to allow a minority to decide on this topic while excluding them from other topics. The foundation of our country relies on the majority making decisions, and it is important to respect that.\n\nSome argue that denying people rights without compelling reasons goes against the idea of democracy. However, the idea of democracy is to create laws based on the favor of the people. It is not about disregarding Christian values or any other values. Each individual has the right to vote based on their own beliefs, including religious beliefs. Taking away someone's right to vote based on their religion violates the First Amendment. It is not our place to dictate where others should get their values from.\n\nThe question of what allowing gay marriage costs us is raised. On the other hand, we should also consider what not having it costs the gay community. However, the need for gay marriage should not be solely based on financial gain. Love should be the foundation of any marriage, and if the need for marriage is solely for financial reasons, then it may not be genuine love in the first place.\n\nThere is a claim that allowing gay marriages would bring economic benefits, with a reference to New York City potentially making millions of dollars. It would be helpful to provide credible sources to support this claim. However, it is important to note that the argument for gay marriage should not solely rely on economic benefits.\n\nThe argument that gay Americans should be permitted the same rights as straight Americans is valid. However, it is important to clarify which rights are being denied to gay individuals. The argument of \"equal rights\" may not have a strong basis if both groups already have the same rights. It is important to differentiate between rights and the definition of marriage.\n\nOne of the reasons why gay marriage should be allowed is the belief that the rights of a minority should not be entrusted to the majority. It is suggested that this has happened in the past and ultimately failed. However, it would be helpful to provide literature that properly informs us about the practice of segregation being abolished in accordance with the minority opinion.\n\nThe argument regarding marital benefits is addressed, stating that these rights can still be acquired through same-sex marriage or civil unions. It is important to consider that these rights were initially given to married couples for specific reasons. However, the argument against gay marriage based on marital benefits may not hold strong if these benefits can still be obtained through other means.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to present my arguments against gay marriage. Firstly, democracy is based on the majority of the people, and laws should not be created that violate the will of the people. Secondly, allowing gay marriage may open the door to other forms of marriage that may be considered abnormal. Thirdly, the value of marriage, which has been based on tradition, legal precedent, theology, and the support of the majority, may be diminished. Fourthly, defining morals is not separate from human will. Fifthly, the impact on families and the potential destruction of the institution of marriage should be considered. Sixthly, the need for marriage should be questioned if it is solely based on love. Seventhly, it may lead to a revamping of sex-education systems and give rise to other controversial issues. Lastly, opposite-sex marriage benefits can still be obtained through civil unions or opposite-sex marriage, making the argument against gay marriage benefits void.\n\nThank you for considering my arguments.", "len_content": 4806, "style": "Argument: I would like to clarify that my previous statement was not referring to the most recent definition. It seems that there is confusion between the federal and state definitions. The federal definition, which is still currently in place, defines marriage as between a man and a woman. While there are a few states that have defined marriage as between two individuals, the federal definition remains unchanged. However, let's move on from this point as it does not contribute to the overall discussion.\n\nRegarding gay rights, I want to emphasize that I am straight. However, even if I were to become gay tomorrow, it would not change my rights in any way. We are not seeking any special treatment. The right to marry is universal and applies to everyone. We all have the same rights in this regard. It is unfair to suggest that only those who support gay marriage should have the right to vote on this issue. In a democratic country, such as ours, it is important that the people have a say in matters that affect them. This includes the definition of marriage. Making a law that is not in favor of the majority of the people goes against the principles of democracy and undermines the foundation of our country.\n\nFurthermore, denying people their rights without compelling reasons contradicts the idea of democracy. It is important to consider the values and beliefs of all individuals, including those based on religion. Our country was founded on Christian values, and while not everyone may agree with them, it is not our place to dictate where others should derive their values from. Taking away someone's religious beliefs as a compelling reason for their vote violates their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe question of what allowing gay marriage costs us is a valid one. However, we should also consider what not having it costs the gay community. Do they need gay marriage to love each other? If so, then it raises questions about the authenticity of that love. It is important to base our arguments on solid evidence and not rely on unverified claims. Additionally, the argument for equal rights lacks a basis as we all possess the same rights. Comparing it to the issue of marijuana legality does not hold up as it fails to acknowledge the fundamental differences between the two situations.\n\nOne of the main reasons why gay marriage should be allowed is that the rights of a minority should not be left in the hands of the majority. History has shown us that relying solely on the majority opinion can lead to failure, as we witnessed during the era of segregation. It is important to consider the perspectives and experiences of all individuals, regardless of their minority status.\n\nIn terms of the argument about marital benefits, it is important to note that difficult does not mean impossible. Same-sex marriage or civil unions can still provide these rights. The value of marriage has been built on tradition, legal precedent, theology, and the support of the majority. Allowing gay marriage could potentially diminish the value of marriage, as it would introduce a significant change to a long-standing institution.\n\nLastly, the legalization of gay marriage could have broader implications for our society. It may require a revamping of our sex-education systems and could potentially open the door to arguments for polygamy, pedophilia, and incest. It is important to consider the potential consequences and implications of such a decision.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several factors to consider when discussing the topic of gay marriage. Democracy, the value of marriage, morals, family, and potential societal implications all play a role in shaping our perspectives. It is crucial to approach this issue with an open mind and consider the diverse viewpoints that exist.", "len_style": 3794, "ideology-content": "Argument: I would like to clarify that the federal definition of marriage is currently between a man and a woman, while a few states have defined it as between two individuals. Moving on to the topic of gay rights, as a straight individual, I do not believe that my rights would change if I were to become gay. We are not seeking special treatment, but rather equal treatment. The right to marry is available to everyone, and it is not different for any individual. The argument that only pro-gay marriage individuals should be allowed to vote is not reasonable, as our country operates democratically and allows all citizens to have a say in decision-making. It is important to consider the majority opinion when making laws, as this is the foundation of our democratic system. Denying people rights without compelling reasons goes against the idea of democracy. While some may not respect Christian values, it is not fair to impose their beliefs on others. The idea of allowing gay marriage does not cost anything to those who oppose it, but it may have benefits for the gay community. However, it is important to have reliable sources to support such claims. Gay Americans should be permitted the same rights as straight Americans, as anything less would be undemocratic. It is argued that the rights of a minority should not be entrusted to the majority, as history has shown that this approach has failed. The argument regarding marital benefits can be addressed through same-sex marriage or civil unions. In summary, my arguments against gay marriage include the principles of democracy, the potential for a slippery slope leading to other forms of marriage, the potential devaluation of marriage, the importance of morals, the impact on family structure, the need for marriage, the potential consequences for sex education, and the availability of opposite-sex marriage benefits through civil unions.", "len_ideology-content": 1907, "ideology-style": "Argument: I would like to clarify that the federal definition of marriage is currently between a man and a woman, while a few states have defined it as between two individuals.

The \"Equal rights\" argument has no basis, and is simply balderdash due to the fact that we have the same rights.

And go ahead and point out that Titanic isn't going to be outstripped domestically either. <URL>... Checking your source you should also note that comparisons between the straight dollar amounts without taking inflation into context gives completely silly numbers. Unless we're going to suggest that the 40 Year Old Virgin did better than every Shirley Temple movie combined we need to account for the worth of a dollar. Notice that Titanic in the list on the link you gave adjusted for inflation 1997 Titanic $886,359,440. Dark Knight is a bit less than half of that. I fully concede that Dark Knight made massive amounts of money it's opening weekend. It beat Spider Man 3. How did Spider Man 3 fair against Titanic? Oh, down at the bottom of the list. To figure out how well the Dark Knight should do domestically we need to look at the trends rather than the opening day figures. <URL>... 7/18/2008 $158,411,483 $158,411,483 7/25/2008 $75,166,466 $313,781,677 -52.55% 8/1/2008 $42,664,219 $393,751,065 -43.24% 8/8/2008 $26,117,030 $441,628,497 -38.78% It opened 158 million, then lost about half that for the second weekend and a bit under half that for the third. If we figure a 40% loss per week which if you check the numbers for other blockbuster pictures like Spider Man 3 seems to trend like that (though Dark Knight opened bigger). <URL>... Figuring in the weeks gross we have 158 million for the first weekend(3 day rather than a week), and 155 million by (and including) the next weekend, and 80 for the next, 48 for the next week. Lets figure only a 40% loss each week. 1 week: 28 million. 2 week: 17 million. 3 week: 10 million. 4 week: 6 million. 5 week: 3.7 million. 6 week: 2 million. etc: ~ 4 million (converging series/guess). This means Dark Knight probably has 70 million dollars left to make. This puts the domestic gross at ~511 million. Titanic gross is 600 million, and 886 million when you account (properly) for inflation. <URL>... The weekend trends on Titanic aren't simply down by 40 every week, they go down ten then up 200 then down 20 and up 10. It stayed on the charts for a long long time. You can't just say see Titanic's opening weekend was a lot like the fourth week of Dark Knight therefore Dark Knight has another 600 million in it. Titanic appealed to a different kind of audience. \"That a movie can open well, and people will stop seeing it after the first week.(Spiderman 3 is a great example of this) HOWEVER, The Dark Knight is an exception. It has been number 1 in the box office for FOUR WEEKS.\" --ZOMG FOUR WEEKS! Is that like the 15 weeks Titanic was #1 or the four weeks Return of the King was #1? Also look at the midweek values. For daily totals Dark Knight dropped down to as low as 3rd last Wednesday and regularly is second for the mid week days. ---- Dark Knight isn't going to make 1.1 billion dollars world wide to offset the all-time grossing list. Dark Knight isn't going to make the 445 million domestically to overtake Titanic's inflation adjusted gross. Dark Knight isn't even going to make the 159 million to overtake Titanic's non-adjusted gross. It'll probably make about 70 million dollars more in the coming weeks. Probably overtaking Star Wars: A New Hope position as #2. Regardless how skewed we try to make the metric is towards your position, you still lose.

I intend to question the notion of what it is to 'deserve something', and whether or not life is something tangible. Best of luck to Pro, I hope this doesn't get too dark!"}, {"effective_argument": "Before going on to anything else, I will clarify some of the terms stated in the topic. The setting should be limited to democratic countries where the capitalistic distribution is possible, and 'privatized' as letting the distribution and sales of water be responsible to entrepreneurs and companies. In this debate we have to interpret whether water privatization's advantages out weigh the disadvantages, and I say no. This issue has been brought up because some think that a product managed by the private companies and the market increases quality and efficiency. This can be true in some cases of the products, but let me prove throughout this debate why 'water' is exclusive and should be provided by the government. First, let's think about the nature of water. Water is the resource that directly affects human life. Access to potable water is included in the UN human rights charter as well. Because water is related to the rights to life, it should not be regarded as a product, but rather a basic, fundamental human rights service that should be provided to everybody. And sources with qualities like these should be provided by the government. Other sources related to rights of citizens such as basic education, access to electricity and protection of the citizens are all provided by the government, not in the company's hands. The government should be responsible in providing the citizens the basic rights. Second, I will compare the nature of the private companies and government, and state why the government does a better job in providing water citizens. We should keep in mind that the aims of the companies are maximizing profits, not providing water to citizens. In these cases, citizens are not seen as citizens that deserve rights, but rather seen as customers providing profit to the company. And when they don't, their water supplies will be cut. It is true that market economy encourages competition and targets lower price and best quality. However, the company will need to suffer a loss in order to acheive this. And when this happens, the company will turn to making a profit at an expense of either increasing the price or lowering the quality. It is very likely that companis are likely to increase the price of water aiming for profit, because they know it is a life source and people would have to purchase it anyway. In contrast, government targets providing the waters to everyone. Their main goal is to provide their citizens what they need. By this goal, at least the distribution is made. Even if it is underpriced, the citizens get to encounter a source of water. Let's take a look at some of the examples of the countries where the water was privatized and suffered of negative results. In a case of England, where there are sixteen different water companies, even though the price went down from the initial cost, their prices are still five to ten times higher that that of countries where water is provided by the government. Plus, their tariffs increased by 46%. In Tanzania, where it is a developing country, the bills went up for the users. And people turned into unsafe water resources rather than paying the increased bills. These were examples of some of the harms that came with the privatization of water. Finally, let me talk about the environmental harms that can come with the privatization of water. The exploitation and depletion of resources can come. The companies are too much interested in making profits to care about how much resource is actually 'left' to use. Even if there were lack of resources, it wouldn't really matter because little supply can be a good reason for higher demands and increased prices. This might cause the water to be gone, and also affect the plans on various projects in water, such as hydroelectric power or projects in canals. Because water is so exclusive and necessary for life and all citizens, it should be provided by the government and not be privatized."}], "ideology": "Argument: Our opponent could not continue the round, but we believe it is crucial to present a counter argument on this important and controversial issue.

My opponent talks about currency manipulation, specifically that currency manipulation keeps products cheap and that there is no correlation between unemployment and currency manipulation. Since my opponent does not cite any statistics, one cannot assume that this outweighs any of the statistics that I have cited. Thus, the judge cannot look to this refutation. My opponent's statement that China and unemployment are not connected is inaccurate; studies, such as those from the EPI [1], connect the China-US trade deficit to severe job losses. Currency manipulation plays a critical role in the amount of the deficit [1], resulting in severe negative effects to the economy. The judge cannot look to my opponent's refutations on currency manipulation; thus, my points on currency manipulation still stand. My opponent proceeds to state that because I am not providing clash, his refutations still stand. This cannot be looked to on the ballot. This completely ignores the facts that several of his rebuttals do not even address the contention I was advancing and that the other refutations are outweighed by statistics I provided. The judge cannot look to anything my opponent provides on this contention. Next, my opponent talks about Irani sanctions. My opponent's comment that I do not discuss the intent and that therefore you cannot look to China or Iran as threats is, again, inaccurate. I have shown previously that China has funded Irani weapon programs, which automatically is a threat to the United States. Not only that, but I've shown that China is threatening the United States' cyber security, which in turn threatens national security. Clearly, China is a threat. Since Iran has several weapons programs and is a well-known enemy of the United States, it is clear they are a threat as well. The judge cannot look to my opponent's points on this issue. My opponent is not able to definitely rebut my points on cyber security either; my opponent's first rebuttal is, as I've mentioned before, entirely irrelevant (no matter the US' ability to challenge China, as long as China is attacking and poses a serious threat to US security, the point stands) and his second rebuttal has no evidence or support, just the citation, \"looking at the data\". The judge cannot look to any of my opponent's refutations, and thus my contentions remain standing. Not only do all of my contentions stand, but all of my opponent's contentions fall as well. My opponent's economic impacts are all outweighed by the impacts I raised throughout this debate (especially dealing with the trade deficit), and since all of his contentions are centered around these impacts, all of my opponents' contentions fall. I strongly urge a ballot in negation of the resolution, based on my demonstration that China poses and is posing a severe economic and military threat to the United States and that any benefits from China are heavily outweighed by the negative effects.

A quick look at the previous round will demonstrate my point. My opponent has given a superficial rebuttal of part and the least important part of my \"fraud\" rebuttal. It is not only the smallest part of my argument against the distinction of fraud, but also the least important argument. Right now, I shall go through each distinction on why SS is a Ponzi Scheme and show the points that my opponent has dropped. I will try not to introduce any new arguments. Note: I only have to prove that Social Security is like a Ponzi Scheme. 1. Transfer Payments Argument for no operational constraint------------> Not enough evidence from my opponent. Rebutted by myself. My opponent had to BOP but failed to back it up. As a result, my opponent has not rebutted any of my arguments. Argument for payments being transferred-------> Not rebutted. Argument for new generation providing resources for the old generation-------> Not rebutted. Argument for being a \"pay as you go\" system in which money from today's beneficiaries are received from today's workers (supplemented by SSO GOV website)---------> Not even touched upon by my opponent. 2. New investors to old investors Same points as the first category. Not at all rebutted by my opponent. 3. No profit Ponzi Scheme makes no profit-------> Conceded. Social Security makes no profit--------> Conceded. 4. Fraud Superficial distinction------> Not clearly rebutted. Fraud argument presented in last round (not the analogy which my opponent clearly straw manned)---------> Not at all touched upon, if even rebutted. Note: I must prove that Social Security is \"like a Ponzi Scheme,\" as defined in the Preface, which my opponent agreed to. This is simply a superficial distinction and does not have to do with the way that SS operates. 5. DR and reason that Ponzi Scheme fails DR is not similar to the fact of why Social Security fails--------> Rebbutted by myself. Striking resemblance between the DR and the reason that a Ponzi Scheme fails--------> Not rebutted. DR=Lack of new investors/labours. Ponzi Scheme fail= Lack of new investors. It is same thing and should therefore be approximated as such. This point was by far the most straw manned by my opponent and the one that is definitely worthy of recognition to myself. Conclusion Social Security involves a transfer of payments, like a Ponzi Scheme. Social Security involves a transfer of money from the new investors to the old investors, like a Ponzi Scheme. Social Security makes no profit, like a Ponzi Scheme. Social Security fails because of a lack of new investors, like a Ponzi Scheme. Fraud is a superficial distinction, which Social Security possesses. I hope the readers took into consideration that I only have to prove that Social Security is like a Ponzi Scheme.
