1,"I will keep this short and to the point. First, you have done a good job as well and it seems to me that you may have written a paper on this issue. You have a ton of sources as well as other well planned ideas. However, I have not had any personal research or knowledge that hasn't been produced from my own brain prior to this debate. I have come up with all my arguments on a whim. I feel this has merit. I am not out to win this debate, actually I am out to simply broaden my horizon from a different view point. The only way to fully understand an issue is to hear both sides, which many people do not do these days. I hate the UN and do hold bias views. We all do and without them it makes a debate dry. With that being said if you access this debate in the ""proper"" context of a debate, you win. But logic isn't robotic and I lean away from many specifically cited facts in debates because I judge the merit of the person writing the facts before I can really believe what they are saying. I simply do not have the time or will to scrutinize the internet for these. Hope that kind of makes sense. I am not a heartless individual and I do care about people that are suffering. But, as Americans we do give a lot of aid to other nations sometime overlooking the problems that plague the inner cities of our nation. We can not help everybody and why does Africa deserve it more than say children in Indonesia? If it is because of population isn't that bias in the sense that it isn't Indonesia's fault they are small because they are suffering in the same ways. Again you must remember the benefits our government would not make from this project other than a warm feeling of helping others. I would love to help others, but the truth is that it is expensive and the international community has come to expect it from us. Much of our good deeds go upraised because many nations hate what we have: freedom, wealth, and prosperity. I feel that Africa is bad news waiting to happen. Looking at the big picture I feel like just being over there is a stepping stone to more violence and death. Our presence alone angers the tyrants. I know you talked about the people dying so there is nobody to rule. These tyrants do not care about these people. They are selfish, heartless individuals. This is why there hasn't been any success with anything good we have tried to promote there in the past. Furthermore, I would like to talk about the state of American foreign policy. All we have now is terrorism on our minds. Caring about the well being of others is that last thing on our mind. Our money and energy is focused on Americans, where it should be and hasn't been in the past. We are involved in two Wars and possibly on the verge of another. Nuclear war is more pressing than water to Africa. Foreign Aid isn't fixed either. It can be changed to suit the needs. I bet we already send a substantial amount to Africa and 190 million is a pretty large increase. Take this all in to account when you think of this project. Sure it would be nice to help these suffering people, but remember the costs of not just now but in the future. I am a realist and the line needs to be drawn about helping other nations. If a nation would like to practice peace instead of ruthless, power hungry dictatorships, I will gladly support them. Until a civil war claims a government like this in Africa there is no hope for Reform that would aid the creation of this water project. I apologize that I haven't laid a nice ground work point by point. When voting on this issue vote with your opinion or what side gave the most logical view points. I would like to note that I never was on any debate team of any kind and I just enjoy hearing and voicing my opinion. Just remember that the more America does to help other people in foreign lands there is less being done at home. There are many domestic issues that are in dire need of our attention. And as Americans it is our job to take care of our own people first and foremost. Our money, passionate ingenuity, and determination for change should be spearheaded into the heart of America.

4,"I'd like to welcome my opponent to DDO and wish her luck. First, I'd like to start out with some definitions so we're all talking about the same thing here. Advertise: to announce or praise (a product, service, etc.) in some public medium of communication in order to induce people to buy or use it: to advertise a new brand of toothpaste. [1] Manipulate: to manage or influence skillfully, especially in an unfair manner. [2] Manipulation: the act of manipulating. [3] Information: knowledge communicated or received concerning a particular fact or circumstance. [4] Media: the means of communication, as radio and television, newspapers, and magazines, that reach or influence people widely. [5] Advertising: the act or practice of calling public attention to one's product, service, need, etc., especially by paid announcements in newspapers and magazines, over radio or television, on billboards, etc. [6] I'll summarize my opponent's case as follows: P1: Media is considered important, yet report different facts. P2: In societies that seek to maximize profits, advertising turns into manipulation. P3: Advertising is information violence. C: Advertising is manipulation I'm sorry if that's not quite what you were trying to say but I tried to pick out your major points. P1: Media is considered important, yet report different facts. Media of course has two separate contexts - media as in the form of communication or media as in the corporations that own the form of communication (e.g. New York Times, ABC, BBC, etc.). I would argue that this is good thing. Having multiple sources of information is critical to better understanding our world and validating the truthfulness of any media outlet. I don't see how my opponent could be down on media for this or why the media should be blamed for any supposed evil of advertising. P2: In societies that seek to maximize profits, advertising turns into manipulation. I'm not sure what societies in particular that my opponent is referring to but I'll assume those that are at least partially capitalistic. Unlike the free societies where capitalism is practiced, unfree societies are where one is forced to do things against their will. Take for example, Saudi Arabia where anyone of non-Muslim belief is not able to openly practice their religion. Or even Russia when it was under Communist rule, you bought a certain brand because that is all that the State offered. That is being forced to do something against your will. Advertising allows the consumer to be aware of various products and who offers them. The buyer then makes a choice based on their own needs, preferences and ability to buy. This is hardly manipulation. In order to manipulate the advertiser would have to intentionally unfairly influence the buyer. But how is this happening? All advertisers freely market their wares in free societies so there is no unfair influence that I can tell. P3: Advertising is information violence. I'm not quite sure what Pro means by information violence. It seems this is a reference to advertising making people do what they don't want to do against their own interest. This is simply untrue. No matter what economic system is employed people always act in their perceived best interest. Again, with Russia during the Soviet era there was a huge black market for goods not allowed by the state. So even when advertising isn't allowed people still seek out the goods they want. Whether those goods are bad for their interest is not the fault of advertising. Conclusion: My opponent's entire case is an assertion. If she cares to back up her claims with facts, I'll rebut those. Since, the burden on proof is on Pro, I fail to see how she has made her case. Sources: [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>... [5] <URL>... [6] <URL>...",0,randolph7,"

For this first piece of evidence I would like to bring up the Sold Waste Agency of Northern California V. Army Corps of Engineers. Here we can see that the EPA ruled this out as the area that the SWANC attempted to fill was already a gravel pit! This is attrouous as we can see that the EPA called this area out due to the Migratory birds was in fact part of a ""bird Nexus"" meaning that the birds stopped their on their way to waterways in their migratory south. [1] We can see that this is a huge abuse of power on behalf of the federal agency as there's no probably way of finding out that these birds stop here on the way to their ""waterways"" and if that's the case then there are hundreds of thousands of key areas of which are under this juristiction. The EPA has recently, in 2015, broadend their defintion of these waterways to, "" 'waters of the United States' so broadly that it covers virtually any wet spot - or occasionally wet spot - in the country, including ditches, drains, seasonal puddle-like depressions, intermittent streams, ponds, impoundments, prairie potholes, and large 'buffer areas' of land adjacent to every waterway ."" [2] Due to this we can see how rediculoius this is as these areas are not even close to being that of navigatable and this is just simply attroucous as these waters might not even run off into rivers, lakes, nor the Ocean. Mr. Gaizano, head of the Senate Committee of the Envirnment stated on the rulings that, ""it is not just costly and destructive for farmers, ranchers, and rural residents,"" but also that ""urban and suburban citizens and their local governments will be subject to increasing federal micromanagement and costly mandates ."" [3] Here we can see that even the head of the Committe in the Senate is showing how terrible it is that our own executive branch is growing and abusing power to that of harming our own economy from not just big business, but the common man is being hurt to. We need to see that these waters need to be in fact navagatable in order for us to violate this act. We also need to look to the bill to see that Rivers are include as part of the inclusion in the bill. So the LA River would be protected whether or not it is or isn't navagatble. If we look at the Raspanos case we can see the governments hypocracy as, on the same plot of land that he got the okay from to build houses did Raspanos plan to build a third house. This third house was between two already pre-built houses and he had already gotten the okay from the EPA and local agencies to build. He began and the EPA went against him even though he'd gotten their okay.

Oh, by the way, did I tell you he was 20 miles from the nearest waterway? This case was a simple repeat of the SWANC case as the Courts nor the government could reform the EPA to meet it new needs.

But it is hard to see how else we are supposed to understand “followed by”; or when the denier of the causal principle says that it is possible for something to come from nothing what are we to understand by “from”?

After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, we had to fight to defend our territory. Sixty years later, most Americans correctly perceived that military action against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan needed to be part of our response to 9/11. We must also be prepared to act when an ally we have promised by treaty to protect is attacked or imminently threatened. Security guarantees, such as those we provide to NATO allies, and those enshrined in the UN Charter, are essential to global stability. In addition, the United States has unique relationships with vulnerable targets that are not treaty-protected allies - notably Taiwan and Israel. American support for them can prevent war by signaling to other powers that these friends of the United States will not stand alone if they are attacked without provocation. Harder decisions involve security threats that are not imminent, and cases of large-scale atrocities. Should we use force to prevent a hostile government from developing nuclear weapons, to weaken an anti-American group forming terrorist cells in another country, or to protect a vulnerable population from ethnic cleansing?

In such cases, however, given that we would be using force first, we must be certain of our intelligence and the evidence behind it. This principles guide us to our decisions.

Also, teamwork is necessary to complete many plays such as the double play, triple play, 2B or SS cut off on a throw to home plate, or even to get a guy out at 1B. But at the same time, each player has to do their part in order to complte the play, thus putting a certain amount of pressure on the player and creating a good kind of stress or adrenaline rush that makes the game more exciting and fun for both the athlete and the audience. The slower paced game of baseball is one of the main reasons why it remains such a popular sport and ""America's favorite past time"" ... because you can sit back, relax, have a beer, and enjoy the game without always having to be so riled up all the time.

And if we are still close to the majority, cutting down our usage on the oil will save CO2 and lower the demand, effectively lowering the price. ""Our foreign policy won't change, we still have allies dependant on oil"" So, if we show them it is possible to survive, or even prosper without the use of oil, then they will consider cutting down on the usage of fossil fuels. ""Are you aware that new reserves are coming and more will come, do you realize the extent of oil that is in Russia?"" Are you aware that we have no idea how many oil reserves we have? We could have enough to last us thousands of years, or maybe just under 200. With demand going up as more countries afford oil, do you really want to be totally reliant on it, less harmful and more resilient renewable sources to use? ""3. So you don't have evidence, and by saying ""whether or not you think it is real"" means that you're not sure yourself. Once more what is the impact? If none, then why bother?"" I didn't say I wasn't sure, I said you might not be. Let's look at it this way: It is real and we do something about it: Outcome = A semi-good result (Some possible economic harm and harm from already caused side-effects) It isn't real and we do something about it: Outcome = A semi-good result (Some possible economic harm) It isn't real and we don't do something about it: Outcome = A good result (Nothing happens) It is real and we DON'T do something about it: Outcome = REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD. (political, environmental, social, and economic collapse, public health is severely reduced) ""WHY THE PLAN IS BAD"" ""Biofuel demand pushes crop production into environmentally fragile areas, collapsing CO2 sinks and accelerating global warming"" Did you think about the ways we retrieve oil and how negative it is? It is much more harmful then agriculture. What about other renewable sources, water vapor or energy for example? ""Ethanol production increases air pollution"" Ethanol isn't a green house gas, and isn't that harmful. ""Biofuels production leads to the exclusion of small-scale farmers"" It is bound to happen eventually, stopping the production of much needed goods isn't going to prevent it. In fact, I AM a small-scale farmer. It has impacted my lifestyle, but not over-effectively, or anything. ""Ask yourself a question, are we ready by 2040? Certainly there are no guarantees? Finally, if the alternative fuels are so sweet, why not mandate by 2030?"" We might not be, laws can be changed you know. And we aren't ready, I never once said they were perfect. ""Also, why should the government mandate? Why not tax breaks and incentives?"" Because it is important to stop. That's the same thing as asking: Why do we mandate murder being against the law, instead of just rewarding people every year they don't kill someone. ""Look at all of those negative things about the alternative fuels, is it really the solution?"" I looked at them, they are part of the solution. Not close to enough, but every bit helps. ""Unfortunately, not. The negative aspects of the alternative fuels just far outweigh the positive aspects."" I disagree.

You didn't say 'do not accept if you do not agree to the rules.'

""To all of my opponent's arguments I say ""No Evidence!"" Therefore she doesn't get a single contention and Con win, if she brings any other evidence later on, it should be disregarded since, it will leave me with less time to argue it which is totally abusive.""  
  
It was just the first round, you still have plenty of time to react. My evidence is just as good in this round the next and the last. I don't use evidence in the first round because I put forth very blunt arguments. I show it later on though. Not only that, but YOU didn't use evidence in the first round. Does that mean your evidence from now on doesn't count?  
  
""1. If we're to not use oil then the prices won't matter to us will they? What is the impact? None?""  
  
Not using oil on our cars, does not mean we will stop using it altogether. We use oil to manufacture goods, make food, etc.

38,"I thank F-16 for this fun and informative debate. I really want to talk about some of his round 4 points, but as per format, I'll only defend my case from his round 3 argument. C1: Economic advantage A: Up-front money Pro's claims military crew work ""long hours"". Since he hasn't actually said how many hours this is, I have found the numbers for him. The Bureau of Labor indicates that servicemen often work standard (40 a week) hours (1). This only goes up if deployed on a long mission. My opponent criticizes living in the barracks because they're crowded and offer little privacy. This is just false. According to Rod Powers, most soldiers get their own rooms (2). Additionally, ""Many bases (in all the branches) are converting to more modern dormitories, which include two to four bedrooms with a shared living room and kitchen."" Increasing in rank also allows soldiers to move off-base for free, which would solve my opponent's Sex disadvantage. This shows that the barracks do maintain a stable quality of life. As before, this means soldiers don't pay a house or utility payment, which can easily amount to an extra $10,000 in saved money each year, plus the $50,000, tax-exempt base pay. B. Indirect money My opponent claims that you can get health insurance and retirement in regular jobs. This is contradicted by the fact that 44 million people have no health insurance and another 38 million have inadequate service (3). Also, only 31% of regular workers get offered a standard retirement pension (4). Contrast this to the military, who gives these benefits to the vast majority of its members and lasts well after they have retired from service. C. Specific advantages Pro says you can use a scholarship to get into college, rather than using the military benefit. Actually, you can use both. Use the military benefit to pay for college, then keep all the scholarship money for yourself, since aid comes in the form of direct cash or credit. Thats thousands more dollars in your pocket. Medical care Pro criticizes military medical care by listing one facility in bad condition. However, this evidence is outdated. The Walter Reed facility he refers to was closed months ago (5). Additionally, the flaws in this facility drew attention from the higher-ups, and in 2007 the Department of Veteran's Affairs ordered a review of over 1,400 military hospitals in an effort to maintain or improve overall quality (6). Medical care is quite improved since my opponent's 2007 link. C2: Employment My opponent writes two paragraphs here but they both use the same argument: Relevant work experience outweighs the veteran's preference when getting a job. This is responded to by my Experience argument under C3, which indicates that those in the military do get practical experience in the field of work, since the military offers training in just about any occupation. This gives them both years of work experience AND veteran's preference, which is basically an instant hire. C3: Personal improvements A. Physical health This point is basically conceded; he's never disputed that virtually everyone in the military gains strong physical conditioning and health. He does say that the ""high risk"" of physical harm (0.1%) outweighs, but this is already responded to. He also says that the average civilian can work out as well to gain strong physique. But according to WebMD Health, over 61% of Americans are overweight (7). So non-military persons don't exercise as much as my opponent thinks. B. Work experience My opponent has conveniently left out his source's info on Preferences, where the jobs the member would like to have are taken into consideration. As far as soldiers sometimes having to go to a job where they are needed, my opponent refutes this himself when he says that this is only for first duty assignments, and afterwards you have much more of a choice of which job you can go to. Pro says there are ""restrictions"" on this, but the only one his source talks about is difficulty getting a job in an overseas base. Getting a job you'd like here in the US is not that hard. Therefore, extend that soldiers will get work experience in the desired field, in addition to Veteran's Preference. This makes achieving one's dream job that much easier. C4: Most people who join the military don't regret it My opponent doesn't actually respond to this point and instead makes new arguments about high suicide and homelessness rates among Vietnam vets. But remember, the US had the draft during Vietnam. One reason the military offers so many benefits today is because its all-volunteer, and needs to give incentives to join. Back during Vietnam, they could just force people to sign up, meaning they didnt have to give good soldier pay, veteran's preference, or any significant benefits to encourage people to join. This contributes to the high rate of homelessness among them today. However, today's military gives so many advantages after discharge that this is a non-issue in current times. Pro brings up that veterans commit suicide at twice the normal rate. Well according to his own source, the actual rate of death is 18.7 per 100,000. This is a 0.02% chance of suicide. The standard rate of suicide is 0.01%, so he's making a big deal over a difference of one hundredth. Remember what this argument is actually about: 91% of Vietnam vets are glad they served in the military. He has dropped the argument that modern support is even higher because the current wars aren't near as horrifying as Vietnam. So we're probably looking at a 95-96% chance that if someone joins the military, they will be glad they did so. This shows that the people actually in the military feel that the benefits do outweigh the harms. Once again, thanks to Pro for this intense and competitive round.

In the last few years, one game in particular has dominated the industry in a way never seen before, drawing players into worlds of their own design for literally hours on end. Minecraft has sold millions of copies and its success shows no sign of slowing down, but for those of you who are worried about fans spending hours watching Youtube videos of others playing the game, research has demonstrated that the educational benefits of Minecraft are almost limitless in scope.

58,"Thank you again, Mhykiel. Rebuttal My opponent rightly points out an error in my explanation of the argument from desire. I suggested a desire for god speaks of god, and this does not do C.S. Lewis justice. I apologize to any Lewis fans who may be reading this. Properly stated, the desire for something more than can be provided by nature speaks of something other-worldly, more specifically, that would be god. Thank you for pointing this out, Mhykiel. Con mentions the theft example and misses the point of it. I was not interested in providing a valid justification for a hypothetical thief, but in illustrating his improper use of the word 'right'. In that capacity, my example stands. In Con's alternative example, a father can justify his belief that his son loves him, but again, this justification does not make that belief true. The son could be deceiving the father intentionally, or the son could be incapable of love and simply going through the motions unaware of this fact, etc. The father's justification of his own belief is not tied to the truth of his belief. It is quite reasonable for a father to believe his son loves him based on a perceived loving nature by the son. On those grounds, his belief is justified even if it is a false belief based on untruth. Con has also stated something I strongly agree with: ""So a ""Justifiable"" beleif is one that can be demonstrated to be pluasiblly true."" The strength of the 'argument from desire' and the KCA is that they are plausibly true. By this statement alone, Con has agreed belief in god is justifiable. The KCA, the argument from contingency, and many of the ontological arguments have stood the test of time (for centuries) because they are very plausibly true. Copleston's Argument from Contingency 1. Things in the universe exist contingently. 2. Something that exists contingently has (and needs) an explanation of why it exists; after all, its existence is not inevitable. 3. This explanation may be provided by the existence of some other contingent being. But then we must explain these other contingent beings. 4. To repeat this ad infinitum is no explanation of why anything exists at all. 5. Therefore, what explains why contingent beings exist at all can only be a non-contingent being. 6. A non-contingent being is one that exists necessarily, and doesn't need some further explanation for why it exists. 7. This necessary being is God. Premise one states things in the universe are dependent on other things in the universe for their existence. I think we can all agree to that. Premise two is valid. Explanations are readily available to anything we may encounter in our known universe. Premise three and four are self-explanatory. Premise five follows from four. As a necessity, a being which is not dependent on anything for existence must exist, and that being is god. I apologize for the brief explanation, but as I pointed out earlier, my case is not dependent on the truth of the syllogisms, but on the plausibility of truth provided by logical arguments.

Here's a website which contains a list of all the great deals Lowes has to offer:   http://www.lowes.com...  
  
Therefore I am meeting my B.O.P even more than my opponent. There is already reason enough to vote Con.  
  
On to his next point.  
  
He talks about Home Depot having more stores than Lowes. While this may true it doesn't mean Home Depot is better. We are having a quality debate not a quantity debate.  
  
He also drops way too many things. All these drops result in a Con vote.  
  
He drops the whole idea of the workers going to training and Home Depot matching prices. Do NOT allow him to provide sources next round seeing that he's had 4 rounds to do so. This shows he fails to meet his B.O.P even further.  
  
Then he drops the F.I.N.D Issue, where we show how F.I.N.D may actually be a problematic system. Home Depot won't know about this because a *Pissed* customer has to go through a long process and is less likely to do so in order to have their voice heard vs. Lowes has a quick and easy process. This is where I prove Lowes is *Superior* to Home Depot and is a major piece of offence.  
  
I also prove Lowes is *Equal* to Home Depot in all *Quality* Arguments therefore meeting my B.O.P more.

Israel is the only country in the world whose judiciary has squarely faced the difficult issue of whether it is ever justified to engage in even a modified form of nonlethal torture unlike the current methods being used by the United States on captured al-Qaeda prisoners in order to obtain information deemed necessary to prevent a ticking bomb from killing dozens of civilians. On September 6, 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court decided that not only is torture absolutely prohibited but even the types of physical pressure currently being used by the United States sleep deprivation, forced uncomfortable positions, loud music, shaking, hoods over the head are prohibited by Israeli law, even in cases in which the pressure is used not to elicit a confession but rather to elicit information that could prevent an imminent terrorist attack. Prior to this decision, the Israeli security services did sometimes employ physical measures similar to those now being used by U.S. authorities against suspected terrorists. Another fact to consider is that Israel used the death penalty only once on Eidolf Eichman who implemented ""The Final Solution"" a plan to kill all Jews. <URL>... As for Israel's enemy Hamas.

Israel is the only country in the world whose judiciary has squarely faced the difficult issue of whether it is ever justified to engage in even a modified form of nonlethal torture unlike the current methods being used by the United States on captured al-Qaeda prisoners in order to obtain information deemed necessary to prevent a ticking bomb from killing dozens of civilians.  On September 6, 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court decided that not only is torture absolutely prohibited but even the types of physical pressure currently being used by the United States sleep deprivation, forced uncomfortable positions, loud music, shaking, hoods over the head are prohibited by Israeli law, even in cases in which the pressure is used not to elicit a confession but rather to elicit information that could prevent an imminent terrorist attack. Prior to this decision, the Israeli security services did sometimes employ physical measures similar to those now being used by U.S. authorities against suspected terrorists.  Another fact to consider is that Israel used the death penalty only once on Eidolf Eichman who implemented ""The Final Solution"" a plan to kill all Jews.   http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org...  As for Israel's enemy Hamas. Before I go into saying how torture is their mindset towards Israelies, I would like to talk about how they treat their own people meaning Palestinians.   1. They have used children as human shields.   http://www.examiner.com...  2. They have TORTURED members of Fatah.   http://m.youtube.com...  3. They have TORTURED Gazans.   http://middleeast.about.com...  Israel is suppose to ""negotiate"" and make peace with people like this? If this is what they do to Palestinians, their own people, imagine what they do to Israelies. The relevance of this is that if people actually think Israel tortures Paletinians they should look at Hamas first.

To clear up what I meant about undermining the war effort in Iraq, I simply meant that we are trying to establish a well rounded government and economy there before we would pull our troops out. Their economy is based almost strictly on oil. It is true that the United States only receives around 12% ( a little lower) of its oil from the Persian gulf, but we are the largest consumers of oil on the globe, so 12 percent of our oil, is an incredibly huge amount of oil that the Persian gulf gets to export (and crude oil just hit over 100 dollars a barrel). If we were to lead a global energy revolution, leaving crude oil in the dust, what would Iraq do with its economy? Therefore, it is in the American government's interests to make sure that there is some form of oil demand, which perhaps is why we haven't dedicated enough effort to new technologies. Absolutely we hear a lot about new technologies coming around. However, these are in large part not government sponsored. Bio-diesel fuel still uses a lot of oil, pure bio-fuel congeals in cold climates. Solar power in government buildings is a good point, but it is slightly for a different argument, although under the same topic as energy. As far as hydrogen Fuel Cell cars, it is a tremendous idea, yet, the government has yet to step in and help subsidize costs to create a healthy market in such things. This all dates back to the government and lobbyists point that I made, and you agreed with in the opening point. Your fourth point that more hybrid automobiles and higher EPA standards for miles per gallon is a good one. However, the EPA is very very low in context to priority in our budget, and within the EPA's new budget that Bush has just proposed, most of the money goes to guess what? National security (protection of waterways, etc). How much goes towards new technologies? Very little in comparison to everything else. In fact I must point out that if the government was to simply insist that the EPA make the efficiency levels of vehicles to run on a standard 40 MPG, it would entirely remove that previously mentioned 12 percent of oil from the Persian gulf. Why hasn't that been done? Greed, as is the point of my argument, the government being ""in bed"" with big oil and big car lobbyists. The car companies don't want to be regulated, because it will cost them a lot of money. As far as governmental bodies pushing for nuclear power, by bodies I don't know if you meant actual agencies or branches of government pushing for that, because as of now it is mostly on the politicians drawing board, and an election topic, rather than an actual process taking place. To close, it is true that oil is deeply ""ingrained in the veins of this country"", yet the point that isn't made, is that its in the veins of all countries. There is a huge political push for oil to keep the worlds economy booming. I think that the scientists and inventors of this world could have a clean oil free car tomorrow.

What about the politicians that might accept some of the political contributions from Exxon? The system is corrupt, and it goes deeper than capabilities.

If one is to say that God is good because he declares himself the moral standard and because all that he does is good, then that is circular reasoning. Merely asserting that everything you do is good, is not enough to make such a claim true, even within the confines of a Biblical framework.  
  
=========  
Closing Quote  
=========  
  
I will leave you with this closing quote which eloquently describes the Christian God's contradictory nature.  
  
""... A God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell - mouths mercy and invented hell - mouths Golden Rules, and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him!"" - Mark Twain  
  
=======  
Conclusion  
=======  
  
In conclusion, I have affirmed the resolution that the God of the Bible is inconsistent in nature. Yahweh clearly is not the all-loving, perfect God that he proclaims to be given all of the horrific atrocities he has committed.",Religion,0,As-the-Bible-describes-God-He-is-inconsistent-in-His-nature/1/,4014

91,"To my knowledge, there is currently no concept in the U.S. legal system akin to ""potential vehicular manslaughter."" I propose that there should be such a concept, and it should apply to those convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Before I get to the crux of my argument, I should clarify something about what I mean when I say DUI. I do not believe that there should be an absolute standard for determining what constitutes DUI, such as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level. An habitual alcoholic could easily be unimpaired with a BAC above the legal limit, whereas a first-timer who hadn't eaten anything all day could be impaired below the legal limit. The determination should be made by a field sobriety test. When one drives under the influence, I propose that this is akin to firing a gun in the dark. Whether or not someone is harmed by either action is largely determined by luck. If a drunk driver doesn't happen to pass any pedestrians or other vehicles on his or her route, he or she simply got lucky. I am uncomfortable with the notion that drunk drivers who are smiled upon by luck are treated less severely than drunk drivers who are not. Let us conduct a thought experiment using two drunk drivers, who are both ""impaired"" (assuming we can all agree on this definition, which I know is a large assumption.) We'll call these drivers Jack and Jill. Jack drives 10 blocks from a party toward his apartment, and doesn't pass any pedestrians or other vehicles. He is pulled over, given a field sobriety test, and found to be guilty of DUI. Jill drives 10 blocks from a party toward her apartment, and encounters a pedestrian crossing the street. Due to her decreased reaction time, she hits and kills this pedestrian. She is given a field sobriety test, and also found to be DUI. Under the current system, these two drivers are treated completely differently. I propose that if Jack were faced with the same situation Jill was, he would have also killed the pedestrian. Yet he is given a much lighter punishment under the current system. I believe they should be treated equally, because the only difference between them was how lucky they were when driving drunk.",0,KevinL75,"

Freedom is arguably the greatest possession of anyone, more valuable in itself than any security. It allows the individual to reach his or her potential, or be able to express their emotions passively without fear of pain or imprisonment. Freedom is an inherently good thing. Anarchy also stands against the power of an individual over other people. This relationship is often exploitative, as power corrupts. It rots a person, and tempts them to abuse what power they have. Such a hierarchy has been shown time and time again to fail us as a whole. And whereabouts on such a hierarchy is the most power based? In the State, naturally. How can a State abuse its power? By enforcing controlling laws and taxes that make the people suffer. While democracy claims that the people have a say in how they are governed, it is too often a decision between two or more undesirable parties, and once a party is elected, the people must settle with the decision made until the next election, in which time they may be imprisoned by a power driven State that denies the people freedom of expression. So what is the answer to this restrictive force? Anarchy. Not the scary unshaven Anarchy that the State would have you fear, but a fair system in which we discuss, co-operate, negotiate and barter in peace on a local level. Such a system is the way forward.

These words are Moro= motto, help= hi) First I will state my platform then I'll name my running mate. 1. Abortion As a traditional Republican I'm pro-life. I'm even against birth control, because I believe that a child is a child when it is conceived. But if elected president I will not ban abortion, the only laws that I'll push forward is that the child must have permission from their parents in order to have the abortion. Also if the father leaves her we'll have him join the military for getting the women pregent. 2. Gay Marriage I'm against gay marriage, but this is one position that I won't touch if I'm elected. I personal believe it is morally wrong, but this is a topic to be left up to each individual state via the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution. <URL>... 3. Voting Rights this is an area that action must be taken. Many states still have hundreds of dead people registered to vote and the death of that person should automatically take them off the registered list. <URL>... However, if the person turns out to still be alive then they'll have to register again, that's all. 4. Foreign Policy Iran and Israel- We need to make sure Iran doesn't get the nuclear weapon, however, the status quo still isn't working. To more correctly answer the question if I get called by the Israeli Minister and they say their jets are going to bomb Iran. I would say, ""We're right behind you."" We must support Israel since it is our greatest ally. Iran must be stopped, but only if they continue to go against the United States. As a matter of fact Iran has been at war with the U.S. since 1977 through the declaration in their constitution, but Congress hasn't recognized it so it isn't a full war... yet. Syria- We must help the rebels, but we can't do this until they have identified themselves. Until then we must continue cleaning up around the area such as Jordan, and Turkey. North Korea- North Korea is a nation lost in the dark, but my question is why the U.S. take action against them hasn""t since they are attempting to get nuclear weapons. We must at the minimum put a global embargo on North Korea. 5. Welfare & Social Security Welfare- First off it might come as a surprise to you, but I'm not going to abolish or even cut welfare. I'm going to have required that the people in receiving welfare must participate in community service or fill out at least 10 applications a month. Social Security- I believe social security should be abolished. For the reason that people should be able to control their own retirement and not leave it in the hands of Wall St. sharks and the greedy government. 6. Drones I believe that the use of drones is great and that the U.S. should continue to use such technology. It keeps our brave soldiers out of harm""s way instead of killing them in a hostile environment. 7. Deficit Today the government is in debt over $16 trillion dollars and it""s growing by the second. We must do something now or our children will be stuck in a world of hurt because we""re here spending like crazy. Now what I purpose the government does is that we go back to the ideals of Alexander Hamilton. We pay back some of our debt and get it back to the pre-Bush era, but don""t pay it all back. We could easily start by stop importing large amounts of oil from the Middle East and instead get most of our oil from the motherland, right here at home. We can use the money saved from oil to help pay back debt and more. The U.S. should implement Platinum coins but don""t distribute them to the public, but distribute them to China and other nations to pay off our debt in order to avoid inflation. 8. Electoral System I believe that the electoral collages should tally votes, but the electoral votes shouldn't be counted to win the election, but instead the popular vote should win the election. 9. Gun Control I am against gun control of any forums. I'm grief stricken by the Sandy Hook shooting and the two cops that got killed in my home town, ( <URL>... ) but guns don't kill people, people kill people.

  On to my rebuttals.  
  Primary Objectives Of Minimum Wage Laws  
  It seems like you don't agree with me on what the objectives of minimum wage laws are. You cite a paper that offers an opinion on the purpose of the Federal Minimum Wage   when it was first enacted  :   
  “  The purpose of the minimum wage was to stabilize the post-depression economy and protect the workers in the labor force.”  
  There are 2 problems with this. First, the Great Depression was long ago, so this is no longer relevant; your source says that   was   the purpose, implying that it is not the purpose today. Second, your paper effectively admits that this may not actually have been the true purpose, since it goes on to say that:  
  “  Others have argued that the primary purpose was   [something else]  ”  
  Since you have not offered an alternative explanation for what the primary goals of minimum wage laws   are  , only what they   were  , we are left with the same 2 objectives that I listed in the previous round: decreasing unemployment and poverty.  
  You say that minimum wage laws aren't directed at reducing poverty. This is incorrect. In his 2013 State of the Union Address, Obama supported raising the Federal Minimum Wage by arguing that full-time workers shouldn't have to be poor:  
  “  [L]et’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.”  
  The Employment Policies Institute also calls the minimum wage “  a program intended to reduce poverty.  ”   (my 4th source from Round 2)  
  You say minimum wage laws don't entitle the unemployed to reaping benefits, but that's kind of a strawman because I never argued that they do.  
  You also say that minimum wage laws “  specifically target  ” workers to make sure they have the wages required “  to live and be in satisfactory health.  ” First, let me point out that this is basically saying that reducing poverty is a primary goal of minimum wage laws, which contradicts one of your earlier statements.

He knew that free will was better than eternal happiness, and forcing everybody to have no choice would have been more cruel than to allow for pain and suffering. Simple.  
  
Would you rather never suffer, or have the freedom of making actual choices in your life, giving your life an actual, personal purpose? Yeah, I though so. So did God.

My opponents acceptance of a ""natural order"" seems to be a more disruptive additude than egalitarian or feminist additudes. When people use phrases like ""natural order"", what they're really doing is denying that social attitudes change or progress at all, and they label any shifts in additudes as deviance. They deny progress is a real thing, all it is to them is deviation, but denying progress is like denying that the wind blows. Whether you accept it or not, it's still going to happen.

For example, Corbyn himself and many members of the public may initially agree to believe that being well principled in thoughts and character are key traits being a good Prime-Minister, but without much enforcement, the members of parliment or the public and easily claim the Corbyn is putting his own principles ahead of the needs and safety of this country.

At the end of the day, history would record him down as a good or bad Prime-Minister depending on the present events and how it impacts our lives.

In fact, even when accounting for the most optimal effects, we would need to wait at least 30 more years before beginning a large attempt at adopting space based solar power. In order for SBSP to be feasible before then, we would require some sort of disruptive technology in orbital launch, such as a space elevator. Another case might be where the Earth's atmosphere suddenly prevented more of the sunlight from reaching the Earth, increasing the efficiency gains from using SBSP. ----SBSP tech won't be available for years. Skarb 09 (Justin Skarb, staff writer for the spacereview.com, written Jan. 16, 2009, <URL>... , accessed Dec. 6, 2011, AL) The danger in making large investments into SBSP while the economy is reeling is that there is only so much money to go around. As such, there is a danger that scarce investment dollars will be siphoned way from more immediately viable and beneficial programs such as terrestrial green energy programs. Some three decades ago the Department of Energy reported in its review of SBSP that ""every dollar spent on solar satellites will not be spent on terrestrial research and commercialization"". Unfortunately, it is these very programs that may be critical to preventing a deepening of the current economic crisis. It would be nothing less than a tragedy of political judgment if the country was forced to forgo the near-term economic benefits of terrestrial green energy programs simply to fund a SBSP program that will not be viable for years, if not decades. ----Even discounting most costs even after 30 years you don't even have 15% back in profit Mok 11 (Brian Mok, CEO at Takezawa, written July 2, 2011, <URL>... , accessed Dec. 6, 2011, AL) Using data from previous studies and our own linearized estimations, we are able to obtain a chart for annual returns on investment. This only supposes that the only cost incurred are putting solar panels up in space. All other costs are completely ignored, such as fixed costs, capital costs, etc. Even the costs of putting up a transmitting array, or construction is ignored. In other words, the costs shown here are similar to marginal costs, if all the space and ground infrastructure was already set up. We are only looking at ""when is it even remotely feasible to begin thinking about SBSP as a mainstream source of energy."" We see from the graph that in fact, for a median estimate, even waiting thirty year is not enough to reach a 15% return. Since we are discounting the roughly 80% of the costs from other sources, 15% is the minimum to begin considering SBSP. ----SBSPs causes Kessler Syndrome Dutt 11 (Varun Dutt, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, <URL>... , written Oct. 10, 2011, accessed Nov. 28, 2011, AL) According to a recent NASA report, the space around earth is home to over 135 million small pieces of junk; another 300,000 medium size pieces (between 1 and 10 centimeters); and over 22,000 significant pieces of trash (over 10 centimeters across). Over 30 per cent of the debris can be attributed to the US alone, reports NASA. In 2009, a US Iridium commercial satellite and an inoperative Russian satellite collided, spreading debris everywhere. A report by the US National Research Council (NRC) says that the problem of space debris is getting worse and has passed a ""tipping point."" According to the NRC report, we are currently reaching a critical capacity, known as the ""Kessler Syndrome"" (named after former head of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, Donald Kessler), in which debris collisions create more debris, which, in turn, is more likely to hit other objects",0,lannan13,"

Skarb 09 (Justin Skarb, staff writer for the spacereview.com, written Jan. 16, 2009,   http://www.thespacereview.com...  , accessed Dec. 6, 2011, AL)  
The danger in making large investments into SBSP while the economy is reeling is that there is only so much money to go around. As such, there is a danger that scarce investment dollars will be siphoned way from more immediately viable and beneficial programs such as terrestrial green energy programs. Some three decades ago the Department of Energy reported in its review of SBSP that ""every dollar spent on solar satellites will not be spent on terrestrial research and commercialization"". Unfortunately, it is these very programs that may be critical to preventing a deepening of the current economic crisis. It would be nothing less than a tragedy of political judgment if the country was forced to forgo the near-term economic benefits of terrestrial green energy programs simply to fund a SBSP program that will not be viable for years, if not decades.  
----Even discounting most costs even after 30 years you don't even have 15% back in profit  
Mok 11 (Brian Mok, CEO at Takezawa, written July 2, 2011,   http://www.pickar.caltech.edu...  , accessed Dec. 6, 2011, AL)  
  
Using data from previous studies and our own linearized estimations, we are able to obtain a chart for annual returns on investment. This only supposes that the only cost incurred are putting solar panels up in space. All other costs are completely ignored, such  
as fixed costs, capital costs, etc. Even the costs of putting up a transmitting array, or  
construction is ignored. In other words, the costs shown here are similar to marginal  
costs, if all the space and ground infrastructure was already set up. We are only looking  
at ""when is it even remotely feasible to begin thinking about SBSP as a mainstream source  
of energy."" We see from the graph that in fact, for a median estimate, even waiting thirty  
year is not enough to reach a 15% return. Since we are discounting the roughly 80% of the  
costs from other sources, 15% is the minimum to begin considering SBSP.  
----SBSPs causes Kessler Syndrome

According to a recent NASA report, the space around earth is home to over 135 million small pieces of junk; another 300,000 medium size pieces (between 1 and 10 centimeters); and over 22,000 significant pieces of trash (over 10 centimeters across). Over 30 per cent of the debris can be attributed to the US alone, reports NASA. In 2009, a US Iridium commercial satellite and an inoperative Russian satellite collided, spreading debris everywhere. A report by the US National Research Council (NRC) says that the problem of space debris is getting worse and has passed a ""tipping point."" According to the NRC report, we are currently reaching a critical capacity, known as the ""Kessler Syndrome"" (named after former head of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, Donald Kessler), in which debris collisions create more debris, which, in turn, is more likely to hit other objects",Technology,2,The-United-States-should-establish-a-base-on-the-moon./1/,42194

People can suffer far worse things than being raped and deserve it e.g. if they fall off a tight rope without safety and become paralysed from the neck down. The level of pain and suffering however does not decide whether someone deserves something, responsibility does.

148,"Inaccurate statement: ""The con states that no one is truing to prove there is a 100%- even though this is pretty much the underlying idea of this debate."" No were do I say this, instead I stated that no one is trying to physically prove, with empirical evidences, that God does not exist. One again, true certainty can only be achieved by refuting something through rationalist arguments (by spotting logical inconsistencies in propositions). ""Furthermore, my C2 and C3 arguments remain untouched. My opponent states he refuted them all at the same time, though he says nothing about absence of evidence or metaphysics."" C2 and C3 arguments are based on empiricism... If empiricism is not up for debate then they are pointless. What does absence of metaphysic even mean... it a nonsensical statement. Metaphysics is philosophy their therefore cannot be an absence of it. ""Third, the con ignores the fact that he has repeatedly broken conduct. I tell this not because I would like a free point, but rather to show my opponent has violated the rules and conduct of the debate"" Yet another distracting argument that does not support my opponent case. Why are we even debating if he will not address the issue? ""And, last, he states all my sources are irrelevant. This is false, as all of my sources correlate with what I am saying. My opponent takes the immature path and states a lot of unrelated sources- which pretty much contradicts himself. He has no right to say my sources are pointless, as he has not posted any sources correlating to his argument either."" You sources are based yet again on empiricism which is not up for debate and therefore irrelevant. ""Con has also failed to show how my ideas were based on empiricism, but continues to claim that they are"" I have repeatedly shown that they are. Empiricist argument are ones that are based on the physical world or experiments. If God is immaterial, how could any such argument logically validate or invalidate him. The only way why to invalidate God is to challenge the very concept of a God and the implication that they have. If the concept of God is not logically consistent than he cannot exist under any circumstances. ""There's a whole debate about whether empiricism or rationalism is correct,"" No, both are correct they are merely just different approaches. His quote: ""According to this view, there is nothing which our understanding cannot grasp, and our perceptions can be regarded as a kind of divine language by which God speaks to us; for God is the cause of our perceptions [1]."" This supports the concept that God has to be logically consistent and since that has be refuted this argument is invalid. ""I do not refute myself, as I never said I was trying to prove my argument to 100%, just to the fullest extent possible."" Your entire argument is hinges on the point that atheist is unreasonable because it cannot be prove at 100% certain yet you admit yourself that your position is cannot be proven at 100% certainty either making your position, by this standard, unreasonable. It is therefore unreasonable to state that pure atheist is unreasonable. ""I stated God can do things within his nature, which, truthfully, is just another definition of omnipotent."" This is an invalid definition of omnipotency since everything within their nature and therefore, by this standard everything, would be omnipotent. In addition, being limited by ones nature is the complete opposite of omnipotency. ""God is all-powerful and able to do whatever he wills. Since his will is limited by his nature, God can do everything that is in harmony with his perfections [2]."" This argument claims that God can do what ever he wills which has been refuted since cannot create something that he cannot surpass. The first premise is wrong making the whole statement invalid. ""This point has been disproven twice now."" Here, my opponent confirms his support for rationalist arguments and in fact they are the only one he uses to defend his position. ""God was defined in the second round (first definition stated) as ""the God from the Bible."""" -> I did not use the Bible because it would give me unfair advantage.

Summary In this round my opponent merely repeated the arguments he used in the previous round while ignoring the arguments I made. He is using circular reasoning to distract from the issue in order to dodge answering the contradictions of the concept of God.",0,ObjectivityIsAMust,"
  
Inaccurate statement: ""The con states that no one is truing to prove there is a 100%- even though this is pretty much the underlying idea of this debate.""  
  
No were do I say this, instead I stated that no one is trying to physically prove, with empirical evidences, that God does not exist. One again, true certainty can only be achieved by refuting something through rationalist arguments (by spotting logical inconsistencies in propositions).  
  
""Furthermore, my C2 and C3 arguments remain untouched. My opponent states he refuted them all at the same time, though he says nothing about absence of evidence or metaphysics.""  
  
C2 and C3 arguments are based on empiricism... If empiricism is not up for debate then they are pointless. What does absence of metaphysic even mean... it a nonsensical statement. Metaphysics is philosophy their therefore cannot be an absence of it.  
  
""Third, the con ignores the fact that he has repeatedly broken conduct. I tell this not because I would like a free point, but rather to show my opponent has violated the rules and conduct of the debate""  
  
Yet another distracting argument that does not support my opponent case. Why are we even debating if he will not address the issue?  
  
""And, last, he states all my sources are irrelevant. This is false, as all of my sources correlate with what I am saying. My opponent takes the immature path and states a lot of unrelated sources- which pretty much contradicts himself. He has no right to say my sources are pointless, as he has not posted any sources correlating to his argument either.""  
  
You sources are based yet again on empiricism which is not up for debate and therefore irrelevant.  
  
""Con has also failed to show how my ideas were based on empiricism, but continues to claim that they are""  
  
I have repeatedly shown that they are. Empiricist argument are ones that are based on the physical world or experiments. If God is immaterial, how could any such argument logically validate or invalidate him. The only way why to invalidate God is to challenge the very concept of a God and the implication that they have. If the concept of God is not logically consistent than he cannot exist under any circumstances.  
  
""There's a whole debate about whether empiricism or rationalism is correct,""  
  
No, both are correct they are merely just different approaches.  
  
His quote: ""According to this view, there is nothing which our understanding cannot grasp, and our perceptions can be regarded as a kind of divine language by which God speaks to us; for God is the cause of our perceptions [1].""  
  
This supports the concept that God has to be logically consistent and since that has be refuted this argument is invalid.  
  
""I do not refute myself, as I never said I was trying to prove my argument to 100%, just to the fullest extent possible.""  
  
Your entire argument is hinges on the point that atheist is unreasonable because it cannot be prove at 100% certain yet you admit yourself that your position is cannot be proven at 100% certainty either making your position, by this standard, unreasonable. It is therefore unreasonable to state that pure atheist is unreasonable.  
  
""I stated God can do things within his nature, which, truthfully, is just another definition of omnipotent.""  
  
This is an invalid definition of omnipotency since everything within their nature and therefore, by this standard everything, would be omnipotent. In addition, being limited by ones nature is the complete opposite of omnipotency.  
  
""God is all-powerful and able to do whatever he wills. Since his will is limited by his nature, God can do everything that is in harmony with his perfections [2].""  
  
This argument claims that God can do what ever he wills which has been refuted since cannot create something that he cannot surpass. The first premise is wrong making the whole statement invalid.  
  
""This point has been disproven twice now.""  
  
Here, my opponent confirms his support for rationalist arguments and in fact they are the only one he uses to defend his position.  
  
""God was defined in the second round (first definition stated) as ""the God from the Bible.""""  
  
-> I did not use the Bible because it would give me unfair advantage. If my opponent claims that the God he is defending is a biblical God than God's contradictions much larger than the few that I named.  
  
""The assertion that God is omnipotent was taken from the Bible. By saying the Bible is not a reliable source, he refutes his omnipotence argument.""  
  
No, the fundamental concept of a God is one that can surpass physical limitations. If a being is unable to do so they he is simply a more advance race.  
  
Inaccurate: ""However, God has not been disproven or proven yet.""  
  
I have refuted the logic of his concept and therefore proven that it is impossible for him to exist.

149,"Thanks DoctorDeku. He mentioned that he will not be focusing on a specific currency. I'd just like to reiterate that my arguments are not bound to the Euro. It is just an example because it is the only modern example we have of a universal currency. I. A Universal Currency Would Be Convenient Eliminating exchange rates is not a good idea. They deprive countries of the ability to control their economic policy. If a country is experiencing a recession, it should depreciate its currency so as to make exports look more profitable to foreigners and to discourage imports, in order to create a trade surplus. However, eliminating exchange rates ends this. Countries can no longer set exchange rates to help in recessions. If exchange rates are too high forprofitable exports, then it's too bad for that country. The problems with this can be seen in Spain.[1] I'll concede that using a foreign currency at home may cause tension, but no system is perfect. However, having a universal currency would not affect tax revenues. For example, a 10% flat tax on income is 10% of all income, no matter the medium. II. A Universal Currency Would Solve Dishonest Trade Tactics First of all, as the article points out, China is not suppressing its currency: ""But there is little evidence the central bank is intervening on a large scale to suppress the value of the renminbi... The renminbi has been under downward pressure because Chinese businesses and households have been moving more money out of the country to diversify their investments and hedge against the possibility of a political change at home.""[2] In fact, ""When a boom goes bust, devaluing currency is the least bad way for governments to rein in wages and prices that are suddenly too high. But if you use the same currency as another country that isn't in dire straits, good luck convincing them to accept devaluation on your nation's behalf.""[3] There's nothing really wrong with devaluing a currency to get out of an economic recession. Finally, I see no correlation in dishonest stockmarket tactics and many currencies after reading his two articles (well reading the abstract of the first one). I ask my opponent give more information on this supposed correlation. III. A Universal Currency Would Encourage Cultural Diffusion I admit, it is a hassle to go to another country and have to use a different currency. However, it's not the end of the world. It's easy to get Sweden's currency made into Norway's (as long as you are in either country). These days, currency ""vending machines"" are everywhere. It is easier than ever to change your dollars into, say, Euros. Next, it is also not that big of a hassle to use money in other countries. Every time I have traveled, I have had such an easy time getting currency that I wouldn't even consider it a hassle. It's a price we have to pay for having the right to dictate our own economy in the ever-globalizing world. And with that globalization, it has become easier than ever to get the currency you need at the proper exchange rate. A universal currency would not encourage cultural diffusion any more than we already have it. IV. A Universal Currency Would Encourage Equality I don't understand why my opponent thinks that we cannot clearly see another countries' standard of living and classify people on a global scale because of separate currencies. All you have to do is divide a countries' GDP by its population and translate that value into the currency you want through exchange rates. We do it for all countries. And again, I don't understand why my opponent thinks that we cannot see that the US is better off overall than many countries. We don't need a global currency to see that. That's what GDP percapita statistics are for. In fact, by putting the world under a universal currency, it will harm smaller economies that have not taken off yet by disallowing them from devaluating their currency to expand their economy, thus making the gap bigger. Conclusion While presenting a solid case, my opponent has several fallacies in his case. For example, many of his sources only back up half or less of his argument. For example, his sources 4 and 5 mention various forms of dishonest stock market tactics, but do not attribute it to separate currencies. My opponent has never proven that point, and several other points in that fashion. He also contains a few fallacies where he thinks a universal currency will help promote equality. One, he hasn't proven that a universal currency will help us see our position in the world better, and he hasn't proven why a universal currency would promote equality in the first place. I even showed how a universal currency harms equality. Not one of his arguments that even make sense hold a candle in comparison to countries being able to dictate their own economic-policies; not a one-size-fits-all policy that will screw up most countries under it.

It shows that men can be sensitive, that they make mistakes and not all of them look at women as sexual beings. The lyrics talk about the subject of a women being powerful the lyrics are sung by Sia and she's saying she's powerful and indestructible. Also that that when she is shot down she's not fallen, so it puts a positive outlook on women instead of them being used as sexual objects and toys.",Music,1,pop-music-is-better-than-rap/1/,53265

162,"I'd like to thank Pro for the opportunity to debate the topic at hand. Nietzche is certainly an interesting figure and left a formidable legacy to be overcome. For this debate I'm going to posit Albert Camus and his philosophy as the philosophical successor and culmination of Nietzsche's thought. The Development of Alienation and it's Responses Nietzsche is perhaps most famous for his pronouncement that God is dead. What Nietzsche meant was not that God was some mortal who had literally been murdered or died, but that the concept of God was becoming less and less necessary as a grounding for our understanding of the world and for things like ethics, meaning, and knowledge. Nietzsche saw that this had left a growing gap in society wherein people now had to look elsewhere for the answers to life's problems. While this doctrine has huge implications for the future of society and philosophy, Nietzsche's solution to the problem was necessarily incomplete (as is generally the case with path breakers i.e., Aristotle's logic and cosmology). Nietzsche's 'God is dead' pronouncement had lasting effects on the development of philosophy and had a direct causal influence on the formation of schools of thought which attempted to solve the problem of dealing with human alienation and whether secular values could be supplanted in religion's place. Existentialism and absurdism are among the most known of the proposed solutions with Albert Camus being the founder of the latter. The basic point in Absurdism is emphasis on what is termed the Absurd, the conflict between man's search for meaning in the universe and the apparent lack of any such thing. Camus argued that when man is confronted with the Absurd, they are presented with three options. One may commit suicide to escape the conflict, place faith in some religious or transcendental realm (a la Kierkegaard), or one can accept the existence of the Absurd and live in spite of it in freedom and integrity. Camus endorsed the last of these options, holding the first to be mere cowardice and the second to be simply a ""philosophical suicide"" as a figurative version of the first. The reason why Camus' doctrine succeeds Nietzsche's is that Nietzsche's solution to the problem was mistaken and because Nietzsche mistook the order of operations. On the solution, Nietzsche's was merely in the Ubermensch as embodying one's values and living ""in this world"". The reason why Camus' solution succeeds his is that the value on which the Absurd man lives are integrity in the face of the Absurd as opposed to one's mere subjective inclinations. On the order of events, Nietzsche posits what could be called the Absurd as being the outcome of rejecting religion whereas Camus showed that it was in fact that Absurd that brought about religion in the first place.",0,socialpinko,"

After, Hill comes flying across the screen and Schumi locks up the tires. You can tell he locks up the tires 40 seconds into the video when his tires stop moving.

This is not a site known for its civility in arguments, where ""Ur a @#$%*&! Moron!"" is considered a clever rebuttal. And while I do not use personal attacks to deliver my opinions, I have used sarcasm and other such tactics in past arguments. I will refrain from them in this discussion. Civility in debates is the main reason for my joining this site. I have looked over your comments, and have found several points that I would like to address. The first point I am concerned with is found within the following quote: ""Even Creationists accept the concept of change over time."" Yes, this is true. My problem with this is that you insist on using the obvious, observable changes within species (species as defined on dictionary.com; the biological definition) as evidence for evolution between major genus. This would be similar to me stating as a fact that a cow and Golden Retriever can interbreed, since a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd can (assuming that, for some reason, I cannot test this; remember that few, if any, analogies are perfect.) You are correct in assuming that I do not wish to discuss the scientific merits of Creationism, as the very definition of God puts him outside the realm of science. Atheistic Evolutionist: a believer of evolution that attempts to fit an intelligent force (most commonly the Judeo-Christian God) into the theory. My reasoning for bringing this up is simple: I do not wish to have these people debate me on this topic, as they take the ""easy road"" of saying ""because God did it"" to answer any scientific questions poised at them. There is another point you made that I would like to address: ""No scientific theory can withstand the scrutiny of peer review if any portion of the theory requires a faith-based position. A theory in science is only as good as the... evidence that backs it up (emphasis on portion)."" Are you certain that you want to stick by this statement? My definition of the ""Big Bang"" is consistent with the statements of one of the originators of the theory, Georges Lemaitre. According to pbs.org, ""LeMaitre put forth the idea that there was once a primordial atom which had contained all the matter in the universe."" This is a more scientific way of saying ""small dot"" (my words). [ <URL>... ] Another point I made was that this atom exploded. This would seem to be evident in the theory's name: the Big Bang. I do not know how far your beliefs in this differ from those of Lemaitre. Concerning the origin of matter; I will be willing to ignore this topic, as it cannot be explained scientifically. Science deals with what exists in the natural realm, and the natural realm cannot create itself (see the 1st Law of Thermodynamics). Only a supernatural force (a force outside of nature) can create the matter, so this point of argument would be useless to discuss. Concerning the ""Big Bang"" itself; there are many questions that have not been answered concerning it as a legitimate scientific theory. When a theory in science has too many questions unanswered, it must be revised or thrown away entirely. This is regardless of whether or not a ""better"" theory exists. When a theory is ""full of holes"", it must be fixed. One question is how and why all of this energy and matter came into the singularity after the point of creation. Why did it start to expand? The observed red shift in galaxies, stars, quasars, etc. is the hardest evidence for the ""Big Bang"" Theory, yet there is a large assumption made here: that the red shift indicates the objects are moving away from us. There is a good book on the subject, written by an evolutionist, called Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science, by Halton Arp. A good article to read on the subject is found in the following link. [ <URL>... ]. In this article, Edwin Hubble is quoted as stating that he, ""... always held open the possibility that the red shift did not mean velocity of recession but might be caused by something else."" This is the only evidence I know of concerning the ""Big Bang"", making the theory unfounded (as far as I know) should the red shift theory be found false. Please state other evidence for it. For reasons of space limitation and order, I will not discuss your rebuttals regarding abiogenesis and the theory of evolution, as I feel the matter concerning the ""Big Bang"" has not been resolved yet.

When a theory is ""full of holes"", it must be fixed. One question is how and why all of this energy and matter came into the singularity after the point of creation. Why did it start to expand? The observed red shift in galaxies, stars, quasars, etc. is the hardest evidence for the ""Big Bang"" Theory, yet there is a large assumption made here: that the red shift indicates the objects are moving away from us. There is a good book on the subject, written by an evolutionist, called Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science, by Halton Arp. A good article to read on the subject is found in the following link. [  http://www.answersingenesis.org...  ]. In this article, Edwin Hubble is quoted as stating that he, ""... always held open the possibility that the red shift did not mean velocity of recession but might be caused by something else."" This is the only evidence I know of concerning the ""Big Bang"", making the theory unfounded (as far as I know) should the red shift theory be found false. Please state other evidence for it.  
  
For reasons of space limitation and order, I will not discuss your rebuttals regarding abiogenesis and the theory of evolution, as I feel the matter concerning the ""Big Bang"" has not been resolved yet.

168,"Thank you for your response, Pro. Firstly, I would like to point out that these hypothetical five men would be producing that much sperm over a lifetime. A lifetime is a very long time. Would it not be problematic if there are more lesbians/bisexuals overwhelming the number of sperm that men produce over a few months? There are about 158.3 million women in the United States (1), and like you said, Pro, 2% of the women are lesbian/bisexual. However, this 2% is still too large for the very few numbers of men all around the sperm banks. Let me just set up a mathematical proportion to display the problem of the sperm donation argument. So, how would 5 out of 100 men (counting all the sperm banks) be able to satisfy the demands of about this many women in the entire nation? Remember, this is considering that 5 out of 100 men only make 2,625,000,000,000 sperm over a lifetime . I repeat, would it not be problematic if the number of lesbians/bisexuals wanting sperm donations overwhelm the number of sperm cells (keep in mind that it takes many sperm cells to penetrate an egg)? As I previously said, the screening process could take from weeks to months for the donors to pass the test. Are the lesbians going to wait for the 5% of the applicants to donate more sperm? Yes, Pro, I am saying that preventing homosexuals from gay marriage benefits them. This is because gay marriage would open up the pathway for more depression, regardless of the levels of tolerance in the social environments. I think it is absolutely okay for me to be saying that they should not be allowed to marry. I know they have done nothing to hurt me, but that is not relevant. The point here is that our society should not be brought down because of their ""love"" concerns. If you are still sticking to that opinion, then again, I say that you are exaggerating your stance. Are they somewhat mentally demented and incapable of reasoning? Also, I have indeed said that homosexuality is a danger to society. However, not tolerating a lifestyle is different from not tolerating a person. One could tolerate a drug addict, but still hate the drug-addict lifestyle. To sum it up, homosexuality must be dispproved (not homosexual people, but the lifestyle) because of the increased depression, substance abuse, and the potential danger it poses to society. I must point out that Con has dropped a lot of points. In fact, he never answered my question about the validity of pedophilia. The G-spots are there in the anuses of males for the purpose of stimulation. However, that does not have to lead to anal sex. A man could have his spouse stimulate the spot by fingering it to intensify sexual activities (2).

""an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market""(1) <URL>... Poverty Reduction Capitalism helps reduce poverty in developing and poor countries. Capitalism allows for free international trade. This lets countries grow their GDP. As you can see in this website, African countries have had a steady growing GDP from 1999.(visit source number 2). Except for the 2008 economic collapse, nearly all years have seen a greater rise in GDP.(2) They can not increase their GDP by 100% with free trade overnight, but it happens over a long upward line. Capitalism raises their GDP. War Prevention Many of you might disagree with me on this one, but it is in fact a very sound principle. Capitalism prevents war. In a communist society, countries have no vested interests in each other. Communism does not allow free trade. Therefore, everything is generated internally. As a result, countries often attack each other with no economic consequences (other than the obvious burdens of war). However in a capitalist society, countries have a vested interest in each other. They are trading partners. For example, Japan provides the U.S with cars while the U.S provides them with weapons. It's a mutual agreement. Attacking one another would serve no obvious purpose. War would be a lose-lose action regardless if one country wins. It's economy of it would be greatly impacted because it has fewer exports and fewer imports. Therefore, this would slow down the entire system. Rise to the top The most obvious beneficial impact of capitalism is that everybody gets equal opportunities. Everybody, starts out in one spot and whoever is the smartest and most cunning rises to the top. Capitalism rewards the smart. The dumb people stay at the bottom. Have you ever heard of a genius homeless person? No, because if they were a genius they wouldn't be homeless. It's a sink-or-swim system. Capitalism allows for loans, one of the most important principles of rising to the top. How would you get past Harvard with no money? You take out a loan.Other systems don't allow for loans, so you can't rise up. Once you rise to the top, you obviously have more opportunities. But the important thing is that everybody gets a chance to rise to the top. Lets compare this to a communist society. Nobody has equal opportunities. This is because there are no opportunities. Regardless of if you are smart or dumb, you will still be farming the field for the rest of your life. Communism is a class-less society. Classes help the economy. The rich serve as an incentive for the poor to become rich. Communist societies pay the same amount to a garbage man, and a neurosurgeon. Is this fair? No. Neurosurgeons require a genius personality while any idiot can become a garbage man. INCENTIVE Capitalism is one of the few systems in which incentive plays a major role. Do you want to own 20 homes and 20 cars? Most people would answer yes. This is incentive. It is a person, place, or thing that serves as a motivator. Why should a communist worker make 20 toys when he would make the same amount of money if he made 1 toy? A capitalist worker on the other hand strives to make more toys because he gets paid more. Capitalism's greatest invention is invention itself. People invent for money. Even if it isn't the first cause, very few inventors turn down the money (Bill Gates). Would have Ford built the first car in a communist society? How about Edison ""creating the light-bulb""? Chances are that neither of these inventions would have happened. Conclusion In conclusion, Capitalism is an amazing system which awards the smart and hard-working. It prevents war by free trade. It reduces poverty by free trade. It gives everybody a chance to rise to the top, unlike some other systems. In the system, the rich serve as an incentive for the other workers to become rich.

I see plenty of evidence from chrisitans and to a lesser extent other religious folks. but I don't see it from atheists etc, why is that? they might claim that it's just not as newsworthy or interpreted that way given the lack of religious context etc.  
but you'd think there's at least be noteworthy evidence, or something, at least, that shows it happens to atheists etc  
  
also, even if i acknowledged that they may occur, it would be extremely very small percentage wise.  
as of now i'd be happy with just couple or a few examples.

Number 1 is a legal marraige between a man and woman. Number 4 is a an illeagal marriage between a man and woman, man and man, or woman and woman. That could only help my argument. The reason that it is not legal is because society does not want there to be gay marriages. >>IN the Christan Faith, there is only 1 Bible. In the bible, it says that a marraige should only be between a man and a woman. ""And the LORD God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.' Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name. So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which the LORD God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. And Adam said: 'This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.' Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."" First, this says nothing about marriage. Secondly, I thought that we lived in a country with freedom of religion. Why does the Bible have to tell us all what to do, Christians and non- Christians alike? I also was under the impression that there is a separation of Church and state in this coutry. There is no national religion, nor can our government create one. We should not be quoting the Bible in a debate about whether or not something should be legal. >>PLease elaborate on what you meen rather than saying why should we shun them from soceity. Ok, if you want to hear what my arguments mean, take a close look. I am arguing that we should give gay people the same rights as everyone elso who is not gay. We should not be distcriminating based upon sexual orientaion. The only reason that we discriminate is because it goes against some people's religion.

Take this for example: The Junkie Monkey Experiment - (hums happy 60's theme tune) In this experiment, a large group of monkeys and rats were trained to inject themselves with an assortment of drugs, including morphine, alcohol, codeine, cocaine, and amphetamines. Once the animals were capable of self-injecting, they were left to their own devices with a large supply of each drug. The animals were so disturbed that some tried so hard to escape that they broke their arms in the process. The monkeys taking cocaine suffered convulsions and in some cases tore off their own fingers (possible as a consequence of hallucinations), one monkey taking amphetamines tore all of the fur from his arm and abdomen, and in the case of cocaine and morphine combined, death would occur within 2 weeks.

They were kept in the chambers for up to one year. Many of these monkeys came out of the chamber psychotic, and many did not recover. Dr. Harlow concluded that even a happy, normal childhood was no defense against depression, while science writer Deborah Blum called these, ""common sense results.""

I will answer.... ""All love is from God even from other people as it hell there is no love, and all the love you feel now is spiritual love."" As science can not excitement with love emotions. It could be possible to decrease or increase the amount of love you feel. But not get rid of it, this occurs naturally anyway, when you injure emotions. There is no such thing as a emotion with no love. You may think hate is a emotion with no love. But you only truly really feel bad emotions in hell. As there is no God to offer good emotions. (God will be none existent to you in hell) Likewise you may blame God for curtin emotions, but God is actually the one not to blame since He is giving all the love He can to you but you simply reject it by blaming God. Hell is a place where you know all the sins which appeared good turn out to be evil and corrupt, Jesus said ""Turn from your sins now"" Jesus did not say that to spoil your enjoyment but to give you ever lasting enjoyment. Love is enjoyable, enjoyment is love-able. Sin is selfish, selfish is sin. Example: Getting into a drunken state leads to bad atmosphere, making it unconformable, disrespectful and insecure. But you are having fun. No? By not getting drunk will allow you to see clearly at the foolishness which occurs. Get drunk in the Holy Spirit and you can see what is foolish. Even one sin will, even if you steal a paper clip. God sees material thing unworthy of heaven, so what you still is not the point, It is the very thought of making the thought come true. Even by taking a paper clip will make you injure endless suffering and pain in hell. If I mention the ""not so good"" news, I must give you the good. Jesus Christ can save you from hell if you trust in him by giving your sins to Him. As Jesus lived a perfect life He should of lived but instead God decided to make Him Son injure instead. So you selfish people (including me) can have ever lasting life. From DE's, people have said hell seems more real than this life and having no sense of the time. Once in hell you will see a faint bright light which contained all the love aviaible to you in heaven, But instead you having it God rejects you like you rejected Jesus Christ. Making a perfect man die for nothing. If you were the only person Jesus could die for on earth Jesus would still have died for you! Yet every time you sin it is like spitting in His face. If you sin once a day that's spitting 3550 times in Jesus' face for 10 years. If you sin 10 times a day that's 35500 times in 10 years. And that's only one person. It seems people forget Jesus was perfect. And they (sinners) are not. As a child you believe in Santa Claus? Most children do. You enjoyed the fact that Santa was a cheerful man, who deserved to give gifts to your children. (If you are a parent you get no credit for Christmas when you have young children as Santa does all the work) You as a Child are born enjoying Christmas every year believe that Santa will come into your house (If Santa was to visit ever house in one night, He would have to spend a 1 millionth of a second at each house) Moving that fast is supernatural. Like the devil who hides, it would be impossible for the eye to see Santa as your eye can only see a maximum of a 20th of a second. So Santa is the devils way for bring in the children into the Physical world (mentioned in my other debate, ""Randomness is a lack of knowledge in the Spiritual and Physical world"") As a Child the Devil acts like the child is in control by doing nothing on Christmas and the devil (now known to me as Santa) has the burden of running about after presents. When you Grow older you become the devils slave as you do not believe in Santa and therefore the devil anymore. Making your life style converted by physical not spiritual beliefs. And now as a adult with money ""You can not serve two masters, money and God."" is more avaible, again more involved in the physical world. So now the burden is on you to run into shops buying gifts you are now the devils slave who has seemed to have disappeared as quickly as Santa did. The trap is hell and if you are still a sinner you will go there unless you trust in Jesus (spiritual) and confess you are a evil person in a physical world.

206,"I have little time to write my arguments and rebuttals, so I will make some brief ones. ----------- Rebuttals ----------- R1: I disagree that the physical condition of a NASCAR driver is similar to that of other athletes, such as soccer players. While NASCAR drivers have to be strong physically, and able to withstand the pressure when driving, they do not spend as much time working out as e.g. soccer athletes. They spend much time in front of computer gaming systems, on which they practice. R2: My opponent mentions high temperatures, driving 500 laps, and with the speed of 200 mph. However, the fact that a car heats up inside, and that there are many laps, does not make NASCAR a sport. It is a mechanical competition. Is all competition sport? Indeed not. Also, driving 200 mph is not easy either, but it is the car that does most of the job, not the driver. Assume we have a simulator of a NASCAR driving car. You sit in a ""box"" that is supposed to be as if you were sitting in a real car. Your opponents sit in another box/simulator, and you all have to compete as if you were driving real cars that are driven in NASCAR competitions. In this case, you compete with others, you get much pressure, the box heats up, and so forth. Is this a sport or a competition? It is a competition. So the fact that NASCAR requires a good physical condition does not make it a sport. R3: The rest of my opponent's arguments are similar to each other. Workout, lack of oxygen, need of good nutrition, etc. Once more I will say that this does not make NASCAR a sport. One should notice that a driver's condition is not the most significant part here. In fact, the car does much more than the driver. I do not deny that the competition is free of danger, but a dangerous competition is not a sport. ------------ Arguments ------------ A1: While NASCAR can require good physical condition, it does not make a driver an athlete. The car does most of the job, not the driver. In tennis, soccer, basketball, baseball, etc., the players have to be more physically fit. In fact, they use their bodies much more than the equipment. A soccer player uses his leg strength to kick a ball. He uses his condition to run, and so on. The same applies to other sports. But it does not apply to NASCAR or other race sports. The mechanical things do most of it. ------------- References ------------- <URL>...",0,Mirza,"

If you look at the policy positions of the Democratic candidates you can see that they all agree on pretty much everything. The question among the Democrats is no longer WHAT but HOW and HOW MUCH. A good example of this is nationalized health care. All three candidates are in agreement that this policy is a good idea, but each have different plans on how to bring this about. Another point is the Iraq War, all three democrats want to end the Iraq war, and again the question becomes how. Hillary Clinton certainly is not the most liberal candidate on this issue, as she does not support a unilateral withdrawal. Second, although Hillary has high negative poll numbers her remarkable fund raising has shown that she is quite capable of raising support. Hillary Clinton does not poll as well among independents as Obama, however she still does well in mock national polls against Republican contenders. Her high numbers in the polls also show that she has support as well, she consistently polls with a double digit lead nationally, and in many key states like Michigan and California as well. I conclude this statement by saying that Hillary Clinton's massive fund raising ability, tried and tested political machine, and her policy experience will be of great help in her primary election, they would also help her compete against any likely Republican nominee. She is not the nicest person, but being a d*** is a quality that served FDR, JFK, and LBJ quite well as they compelled Congress to bring about change.

215,"Thanks to F-16 for continuing this very informative debate. I hope my opponent has learned just as much as I have form this round. As per format, I will only refute my opponent's case in this round. C1: Risk of injury Despite stereotypes, the military is relatively risk-free. Pro claims that 50,000 people have died in the War on Terror. However, only 6,000 of these are military casualties (1). Lets find an actual percent chance of death. Over 1,400,000 people are in the military. 6000 have died in a span of 9 years in the War on Terror, so that's an average of 667 deaths a year. That means you have a 0.05% chance of dying. This is negligible and should not carry significant weight in this round. Additionally, Pro claims that 1200 servicemen suffer amputations. This is 0.1%. There's a one in a thousand chance of this happening. Also, most servicemen aren't anywhere near danger zones. Between Iraq and Afghanistan, we have about 150,000 troops in these areas, which is only a tenth of our military force. So chances are, you won't even be sent overseas, let alone shot or killed. C2: PTSD My opponent says that 5-15% of servicemen suffer PTSD. However, Psychology Today indicates that 8% of people in general will suffer from it(2). So the chances of getting PTSD are no greater in the military than they are in regular civilian life. The military also offers counseling for soldiers who've seen some nasty stuff. For instance, soldiers returning from Iraq are required to meet with a psychologist to help them deal with what they've been through (3). So while some soldiers suffer psychological trauma, mandatory counseling helps several of them recover. Also, my opponents source 5 indicates that the Army is accountable for 67% of PTSD cases that do occur. The alternative then would be to just join the Navy or Marines, which would make this risk even smaller. C3A: Cannot choose the war Remember that 90% of troops don't even go to war, so this is another exception. Then you take the 10% of people who ARE fighting, assume that 50% of them are against the war (though this number is probably much lower), and you have a 5% chance of this disadvantage actually applying. SPB: Creativity Every job has a strict chain of command, not just the military. All workers have to do what their boss or superior tells them, lest they be fired. For instance, if a patrol officer disobeys the county sheriff, he will be written up and punished accordingly. There is nothing wrong with this system. My opponent would have you think that having to obey a superior at all times is ""stifling creativity"". Whether or not you think this is true, it happens in every job, so its not a reason to reject the military. C4: Sexual misconduct According to Sexual Harassment Law Firms, "" anywhere between 40-70% of women and 10-20% of men have experienced sexual harassment in the (average) workplace . (4)"" By comparison, 56% and 12% in the military is fairly good. The stats show that you are actually safer from sexual harassment in the military than you are in regular civilian life. Also, my opponent suggests that 3000 servicepeople are raped every year. However, out of the 1,400,000 people in the military, this is about 0.2% of the military population. So this is yet again, another minuscule exception. C5: Delay of veteran benefits I'd like to point out that his source is only for the delay of college tuition, not benefits in general, so the impact here is very limited. His source on this is from 2009. However, the GI Bill that gives these veterans benefits has been reformed drastically since early 2011 (5). His criticism is of a bill that no longer exists. C6: Dishonorable discharge My opponent admits in the comments that the percent of people who are dishonorable discharged is ""not too many"", making this another exception. Keep in mind that in order to receive a dishonorable discharge, you either have to 1. Kill someone, 2. Rape someone, 3. Take hard drugs, or 4. Commit various types of robbery and fraud (6). As long as you don't plan on committing any felonies during the tenure in the military, there's not a problem here. My opponent's source does indeed say that cowardice can be punished with death (lol?). I'm not sure if this is a typo or what, but I am pretty sure that this is never actually enforced. Conclusion I'll close by saying that five of my opponent's six arguments are extremely rare exceptions. For instance, he wants people to not join the military for the 0.05% chance of dying, the 0.02% chance of rape, and the 0.08% chance of being amputated. The other disadvantages, such as sexual harassment and PTSD, are just as likely to happen in regular civilian life. Dishonorable discharge only happen to servicemen who commit felonies, which is probably a small minority as well. The only consistent criticism is that some soldiers might get delayed college benefits. However, this program has been reformed drastically since the year of my opponent's evidence, so this doesn't apply either. In comparison, the economic, employment, and health advantages of joining the military occur almost 100% of the time. All service crew are paid at least 50,000 with no house or utility payment, all members who don't commit crimes will get employment advantages, and everyone gets retirement and medical help, as well as physical conditioning.

If you do not explain the resolution in your own words in round 1 and satisfactorily demonstrate to me that you understand the resolution, the debate will not take place and I win by default. (2)This debate is not concerned with philosophical possibilities. It is possible to conceive of a planet run by hobgoblins, where gravity is stronger than electromagnetism, but the ability to conceive of that scenario does mean that humankind should automatically have an interest in such a possibility and invest research in anti-hobgoblin weaponry. Likewise, just because you can conceive of god, does not mean that humankind should take interest in the ramifications of the existence of such a thing. There has been no evidence for god that has satisfied the scientific community of cosmologists, and in accepting the debate, you accept this. (3)You shall not misuse the word ""evidence"". Within this debate, to be clear, the word evidence means ""repeatable quantifiable observation, such as measuring the weight of a stone or the charge of an electron"".

So they exploit that, they call it ""god"", they say he has rules, and I think it's cruel. I think you can do it absent from religion. If you think there is a man-like, all-powerful deity in the sky, or some other unexplored region of existence, you cannot refer to him as ""God"" (starting from Con1's round 1 until the end of the debate) , instead you must refer to him as ""The Creator of the Universe"", ""The thing that listens to our prayers, evaluates the morality of our life, and sends our consciousness to some unexplored region of existence following death"", or anything else that specifically describes what you are trying to get at. --- Here I shall explain the resolution in my own words, using my analogy with Bigfoot: The origin of Bigfoot, as far as we can scientifically be certain, was that a man saw something move through the bushes and to make up for the lack of sensory perception, he superstitiously assumed that it was a tall, ape-like beast capable of mutilating him to death (the brain can imagine things that aren't there, refer to the image below. Do you fear the rocks? Why?). He described his encounter with other people, and then other people's brains started doing the same thing, except they hadn't even seen the thing in the bushes , they just heard the bewildered woodsman describe his close encounter with an unknown object. My argument is that God has the same kind of origins as Bigfoot. No one really knows who the first man was to say ""There's a God in the sky who created everything and has almighty power over us all"", but no such being has actually been observed (just like no Bigfoot has ever been observed). One of our ancestors was probably out in a field and saw lightning, and his brain incorrectly filled in the rest. It was just a static discharge, but our ancestor thought it was an angry man in the sky hurling blazing arrows down at earth. This is the most likely origin of the conception of a powerful being that sits above us, created everything, and has complete control over all of us.

  Terms and Conditions of the Debate:  (1)First round is for acceptance and demonstrating that you understand the resolution. If you do not explain the resolution in your own words in round 1 and satisfactorily demonstrate to me that you understand the resolution, the debate will not take place and I win by default.  (2)This debate is not concerned with philosophical possibilities. It is possible to conceive of a planet run by hobgoblins, where gravity is stronger than electromagnetism, but the ability to conceive of that scenario does mean that humankind should automatically have an interest in such a possibility and invest research in anti-hobgoblin weaponry. Likewise, just because you can conceive of god, does not mean that humankind should take interest in the ramifications of the existence of such a thing. There has been no evidence for god that has satisfied the scientific community of cosmologists, and in accepting the debate, you accept this.  (3)You shall not misuse the word ""evidence"". Within this debate, to be clear, the word evidence means ""repeatable quantifiable observation, such as measuring the weight of a stone or the charge of an electron"". A personal anecdote, such as ""I was overwhelmed by the power of god"", will not be considered evidence of anything other than your supposed emotional state.  (4)It is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god. Using the statement ""it is impossible to prove god exists"", or ""it is impossible to prove god doesn't exist"",   is not a valid argument within this debate.  (5)""God"" shall be defined as in this quote from George Carlin, from Con's round 1 until the end of the debate:  If it's true that we're all from the center of a star (every atom in each of us from the center of a star) then we're all the same thing; even a coke machine or a cigarette butt in the street in buffalo is made out of atoms that came from a star.

220,"I would like to thank bigtree for his attempt to affirm the resolution. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to teach my opponent and all voters who are unaware of this concept about significant figures, also known as sig figs. <URL>... Significant figures are used to approximate measurements so that they are not horribly incorrect. For example, if you had one string length measured to exactly a centimeter long and another string measured to a length of approximately a kilometer, maybe more, maybe less, then instead of saying that their combined length is 1000.01 km, you would say that their combined length is 1000 km, because the longer piece's length is only approximated, and a result cannot be more precise than the least precise measurement used. For multiplication, the number of sig figs in the solution is equal to the minimum of the sig figs in the two numbers multiplied together. For example, let's take a largely approximated measure of thirty cubits (one significant figure) as the circumference of a vessel. Let's also take pi. Pi's value could be considered 3, 3.14, 3.1415, 3.<PHONE>, whatever. 30 / 3 = 10 (1 sig fig) 30 / 3.14 = 9.55 (3 sig figs) -> 10 (1 sig fig) 30 / 3.1415 = 9.5500 (4 sig figs) = 10 (1 sig fig) And so on... The point is, the known value of pi at the time of the writing of I Kings cannot be determined from the circumference and calculated diameter. (It could be the diameter and calculated circumference, but that's irrelevant.) All that we can discover is that pi is approximately three, which is it. They might have known pi to one digit, they might have known pi to three digits, we don't know. Therefore, the resolution is negated. Vote CON. Again, I would like to thank bigtree for this debate.

232,"Under the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy, the military is not allowed to question a service member's sexual orientation. However, if it becomes clear (through actions, confessions, etc.) that a service member is gay, he or she may be discharged due to their orientation. As a policy, DADT fails in all respects. It is a tragic attack on the rights of gays and bisexuals and does little to protect military readiness. The United States Federal Government should repeal the current policy of ""Don't Ask Don't Tell."" While there is no federal protection against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, DADT is the only policy that explicitly encourages such discrimination. Interestingly, the policy seems to be designed to discriminate specifically against people with homosexual identity, i.e. gays and bisexuals as people, rather than homosexual conduct. In U.S. Code Title 10, Section 654 the law states that a service member may be discharged for same-sex relations UNLESS ""such conduct is a departure from the member's usual and customary behavior"" and is ""unlikely to recur."" However, the law is also very clear that a simple admission of homosexuality is sufficient ground for discharge. In other words, if you are straight but decide to experiment on a really wild night, you can stay in the military, but if you so much as mention that you consider yourself to be gay, the military has no place for you. The DADT policy is aimed at erasing the gay identity and the gay individual, not at preventing homosexual acts. This discriminatory policy also severely undermines the military's ability to protect its members from harassment. Suspected homosexuals are sometimes harassed within the military, but this harassment often goes unreported. Members of the military who have been harassed are often afraid that drawing attention to the harassment will result in expulsion from the military, EVEN THOUGH THE HARASSED MAY NOT BE GAY. It is important to note that DADT does not prevent anti-gay harassment and prevents the military from adequately responding to these incidents. A repeal of DADT would allow the military to take an active role in developing policies that prevent and react to (sometimes violent) harassment and working to decrease homophobia. The current policy only reinforces homophobic attitudes by labeling gays as a group that must be erased. Homosexuals are not the only ones who feel the sting of DADT. The policy works to undermine women of all orientations by reinforcing patriarchal power structures. Women who do not conform to traditional feminine expectations in their military career, such as those who exhibit masculine talents and attributes, may be rumored to be lesbians. Due to the fear of discharge that DADT creates, many women feel compelled to assume traits that are perceived as feminine. DADT also gives sexual assaulters a tool against women. In a practice known as lesbian baiting, women may be sexually assaulted or raped, and then accused of being lesbians if the woman reports the violence. Fear of being labeled a lesbian also causes some women to give in to sexual advances made by male members, Women may feel that if they reject the advances of the men around them, they will be seen as lesbian. In this way, the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy undermines the protection of female service members. DADT undermines the Armed Forces core values of honesty, integrity, and respect. The policy creates an environment of suspicion and hostility where individuals must continually prove their heterosexuality. Those who hope to enforce the policy must look for subtle signs that could give away potential members of the unwanted minority. Everyone is suspect because anyone could be gay. Individuals must continually submit themselves to self-surveillance in order to make sure they do not come off as gay, or in the case of one female enlistee ""not feminine enough."" This constant suspicion and panopticon of self surveillance may be subtle in military life, but they are ever present and certainly unhealthy. Morale and cohesion may actually be hurt by the current DADT policy. The atmosphere of suspicion that DADT encourages can work to divide units. The policy also encourages the idea that gay members do not belong and should be expelled. When a team mate is perceived or SUSPECTED of being gay, this idea may help to separate him from the unit. If DADT were repealed, the military could pursue an aggressive stance of inclusion of homosexuals. Furthermore, gays would no longer be viewed as people who do not belong in the military, making full inclusion of all service men much easier. Unfortunately, DADT precludes and possibility for meaningful inclusion. We have not yet come to the greatest reason to repeal DADT. The purpose of the army is to defend this country and its values. When a policy works to WEAKEN the army, when it serves to ENDANGER our country, it must be repealed. If a policy puts the men and women of America in unnecessary danger, it is a policy that must change. DADT hurts military readiness. According to a 2005 GAO report, approximately 10,000 gay service members have been discharged since the creation of the DADT policy in 1993. A significant number of these discharged personnel held specialized positions such as linguistic professionals, translators, and doctors. Many of the fired translators spoke Arabic and other languages crucial to counter-terror tasks. The GAO estimated that the cost of replacing the discharged members is about $96 million, though this estimate has been frequently challenged as too low (the Blue Ribbon Commission claims the cost to be $363 million).

Does my opponent believe men should always have the final say on every single matter in the household? I call that megalomania. So does that mean my opponent believes that women shouldn't have the right to leave such a ridiculous situation, or be able to defend herself mentally or physically (if need be) from that kind of circumstance? If so, that would mean my opponent IS against legal equality of women, even though he claims he is not. So far, I'm fairly underwhelmed by my opponents entire argument. Even if my opponent could prove that women are ""less stable then men"", or ""people are less happy than ever in relationships"", it would be of no consequence within this debate because our relationships are not publicly influenced or owned, they are a private matter between two consenting adults. My opponent so far has failed to show how public attitudes can effect private relationships. If every other couple on earth, broke -up with each other, that should mean nothing to you and your spouse because your relationship is personal to you and your spouse ONLY, it is owned by you and your spouse only. When will we stop letting these socialistic attitudes toward relationships stop effecting our personal space? If you let public opinion adversely effect your private relationship, then you deserve all the unwanted consequences of your actions (and I hope it never stops stinging for you!!!). Stop tacking my relationship onto you barely coherent ""observations"" of relationships!!! My spouse and I are quite happy with our shared responsibility based relationship, and if yours didn't work out for you, too bad, so sad! It doesn't affect my relationship with my spouse. As far as women being the houskeeping unit of the relationship, that is a matter that's decided between two consenting adults. Although, even if most households wanted to have the woman stay at home and maintain the household, that's no longer a viable option for most couples. Unfortunately, because of these socialistic attitudes that have infected our society in the past century, minimum wages have gone up. When minimum wages go up, so do prices (cost of living). When the cost of living goes up, then regular households need to rely on women to make a living as well. My opponent seems to suffer from a ""ninteen-fiftees hallucination"".

The 1st major issue is my opponent drops every argument he makes from this line "" We go to training every month to know how to deal with customer and get what they want and need. We will do everything possible to lower the price if the customer ask for it."" To the end of that paragraph. He did not address my first response to these arguments about no source being provided where we can see that Home Depot does send its employees into training every month or care for the little ones or even has the 10% military discount. Extend this whole point and don't let him even touch these points again because he totally dropped them in his third round argument. Now lets move on to his 3rd round arguments. First he provides Forbes.com as a source as to why the Home Depot is better. Forbes doesn't say Home Depot is better it simply says Home Depot makes more money. Then he tries to say that Sales = People buying at the store. This isn't necessarily true just because your sales are high doesn't mean you have more customers walking into your doors. You could have one rich person buying improvements for 7 of his houses and have really high sales. Therefore more sales doesn't necessarily = more customers. Another point Forbes points out is net increase. Lowes had a high net increase than Home Depot. Lowes increased 2.8% while Home Depot increased 2.2% Lowes is increasing at a faster rate than Home Depot. This means Lowes is either better at getting more customers to come in or have more recurring customers since they increased more than the Home Depot. Therefore Lowes is superior in this category. In his counter to my point 1 I have two things to say. 1) You require a receipt which means I might have lost my receipt from Home Depot and therefore can't have my voice heard unless I buy something else from there. This isn't really effective since customers who are pissed at Home Depot probably don't want to shop there again to get another receipt in order to voice their complaints. 2) Even if you don't buy that argument I don't have to prove Lowes is better in this sense all I have to prove is that both stores are equal when it comes to having the customers voice heard. Then the whole F.I.N.D Issue. The situation didn't mean that the Lowes associate was watching him for theft rather they kept checking or kept finding to see if they needed help. Find means to look for which is exactly why that customer was pissed because associates looked for him or went to find him rather than him ask for help when he needs it. That website says they value customers but it doesn't show that they actually do. Once again my opponent doesn't have any empiric evidence as to how Home Depot truly values the customer more than Lowes. Also he drops the military discount argument and I provided a source showing Lowes has that [1] but he provides no source showing Home Depot has it. Here again Lowes is better.",0,Guitar_Guru,"

Research in the UK has found that ""reoffending is higher amongst criminals who are locked up than do community sentences--with 74% of ex-inmates at one prison convicted again within a year."" [6]  Contention 3: Economy  Community sentences and rehab are invariably far cheaper than prison sentences. To take two examples, here are costs in the UK [8] and in North Carolina [9] This is especially significant as these kind of programs have also been shown to be more effective at reducing recidivism than prison sentences.  Over to con. In order for my opponent to win this debate, my opponent must show that punishment is equal to or greater than rehabilitation.  ________________________________________________________________________________________  [1]   http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org...

This same fallacy is done with the universe, where the Universe is supposed to be all things that exist, thus we shouldn't be talking about other universes, for technically they are just parts(sub universes) of THE UNIVERSE.

What are we falling behind on? I am going to put it this way, Say you leader of a group of important people and one of these people falls behind and is not able to reap any kind of benefit and you have the know how to get that person to get a better life. Shouldn't it be the leaders job and responsibility to help the person into gaining those benefits of life? Now lets put that with the U.S. We are the leading country of the world militarily, as the leader it is our responsibility to help those who don't have their full potential out. Just as the leader of the people should help if able, the U.S. should help as the leader. Other wise we forfeit our role as leader because we are unable to help others. Ok lets go to spending the money on our own country: The U.S. Government has raised the debt threshold time and time again so that we can borrow money from other countries. If you want the money to be spent elsewhere we take it from the job that America was meant for and get our leadership aka the Government to stop borrowing money and focus and helping our economy for the better. Ok now one of my favorite subjects to argue about: Health care: What is health care, well it is a privilege. No health care is not a right. How have we fallen behind in health care? This can be answered very simply by the universal health care bill. What does this do? I caused the Government to spend money on the people who can't spare a dime. Because the American people can't pay for this what do they do? They borrow money from other countries. Again this proves my point about wasting our money. Now you may think, but what about the poor people who can't pay for it. Did you know that most of the people who get on a government paid program like to stay there because it means no work for them. Lets face it most people are lazy. Don;t get me wrong the people working and trying to get out of poverty are going to get out soon enough. others though will stay and suck up our taxes. You say our money is wasted on the military, look to America and see what is truly causing this. On to your point about fixing ourselves and that we can't fix others: My previous points explain the way to fix ourselves not phasing out the military. The military should stay strong as it always has. tapering with it causes an unbalance in the global affairs. Look to America fix what it here. I have never disagreed with helping other, but if these people we are trying to help in America are taking the money and not tying to help themselves. Why I ask are we supposed to continue giving then more money through more bills and now health care.

Ok Then I will go over the Pro's points and argue them:  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
First off with the spending of the U.S. Dollar is causing us to fall behind.  
What are we falling behind on?  
I am going to put it this way, Say you leader of a group of important people and one of these people falls behind and is not able to reap any kind of benefit and you have the know how to get that person to get a better life. Shouldn't it be the leaders job and responsibility to help the person into gaining those benefits of life?

Ok lets go to spending the money on our own country:  
The U.S. Government has raised the debt threshold time and time again so that we can borrow money from other countries. If you want the money to be spent elsewhere we take it from the job that America was meant for and get our leadership aka the Government to stop borrowing money and focus and helping our economy for the better.

245,"All right. I think it is safe to assume that you are a Policy debater, and thus it wouldn't be unfair to treat this round as such. Therefore, I ask that my opponent and the voters all treat this like a Policy round, and adhere to the rules and structuring of one. That being said, here is the resolution: Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its public health assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa. For those non-policy debaters, the resolution is what is being debate over. The Affirmative advocates a plan that has distinct advantages over the status quo (current system). The Negative team (Con) supports the status quo over the plan. Any plans outside this resolution (i.e. a plan giving aid to Germany) are un-topical, and should not be voted for (assuming the Negative brings this up). First off, I would like to ask several things: 1. Provide sources for your Inherency/Harms Evidence. Sources are important specifically on statistics, because they make your claims credible. As of now, your claims have no weight in this round because they are not backed up. 2. Clarify your plan. What exactly are you changing about Bush's Malaria Plan? You say something about DDT, drugs, and bed nets, however the current plan does this already. If the Pro team doesn't change anything, then the Affirmative team is un-topical (violation: increase) because nothing is increasing. Aid is staying the same. 3. Give something that says that your plan can solve. I'll attack the plan on the assumption that it can solve, but I would like to bring into question whether or not it can. 4. Provide Advantages. What this does, is provide reasons the plan is better than the Status Quo. Also, just saying your plan solves for Malaria isn't any advantage. You must prove that there are advantages outside of solving in order to garner any votes in today's debate. Just a heads-up: SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa. Alright, now on to my attacks: 1. Topicality: Word: Sub-Saharan Africa. Infraction: Bush's Malaria Plan provides aid to: Angola, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Benin, Ethiopia (Oromia Region), Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia. ( <URL>... ) Now, these are all Sub-Saharan countries, but the real problem is... there are 33 other countries in SSA. Obviously the Pro is not providing aid to Sub-Saharan Africa if they just give aid to 1/3 of the countries. The Pro's plan text no where says anything about expanding the Malaria Plan's targets for all of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Con must therefore assume that the only countries tackled by the plan are the ones tackled by the current plan.

Justification: ""action must be taken"" is the phrase I really want to center in on. Assuming Pro wants to stay topical, they advocate the U.S. as the actor. However, because of burden of proof, the Pro is required to justify that U.S. action is superior to either inaction or action by another actor. The Pro stated nothing about how the actual action taken by America would be superior to, say, the European Union... and therefore has not justified the terms of the resolution (specifically ""United States Federal Government""). On demand, I can produce evidence showing other actors to be competent and willing to address the malaria issue. 3. Inherency The Pro advocates supporting Bush's Malaria Plan, however isn't clear as to what they are changing. This brings up two problems.

This link talks about how the Climate makes Malaria unsolvable. Just another barrier that prevents the Affirmative from solving. <URL>... This talks about how agricultural development keeps Malaria from being solved. I can bring up more, but I think this will suffice, for now. 6.

With the plan, either African countries won't accept our DDT and the affirmative can't solve or the African countries will accept and our DDT use will ruin their economies and agricultural system leading to extreme poverty and famine. Pro may argue that misuse of DDT won't happen, however: Misuse of DDT will happen unless the significant lack of infrastructure in the Status Quo is addressed and solved ( <URL>... ) 7.

All right. I think it is safe to assume that you are a Policy debater, and thus it wouldn't be unfair to treat this round as such. Therefore, I ask that my opponent and the voters all treat this like a Policy round, and adhere to the rules and structuring of one.  
  
That being said, here is the resolution: Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its public health assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa. For those non-policy debaters, the resolution is what is being debate over. The Affirmative advocates a plan that has distinct advantages over the status quo (current system). The Negative team (Con) supports the status quo over the plan. Any plans outside this resolution (i.e. a plan giving aid to Germany) are un-topical, and should not be voted for (assuming the Negative brings this up).  
  
First off, I would like to ask several things:  
  
1. Provide sources for your Inherency/Harms Evidence. Sources are important specifically on statistics, because they make your claims credible. As of now, your claims have no weight in this round because they are not backed up.  
  
2. Clarify your plan. What exactly are you changing about Bush's Malaria Plan? You say something about DDT, drugs, and bed nets, however the current plan does this already. If the Pro team doesn't change anything, then the Affirmative team is un-topical (violation: increase) because nothing is increasing. Aid is staying the same.  
  
3. Give something that says that your plan can solve. I'll attack the plan on the assumption that it can solve, but I would like to bring into question whether or not it can.  
  
4. Provide Advantages. What this does, is provide reasons the plan is better than the Status Quo. Also, just saying your plan solves for Malaria isn't any advantage. You must prove that there are advantages outside of solving in order to garner any votes in today's debate.  
  
Just a heads-up: SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa.  
  
Alright, now on to my attacks:  
  
1. Topicality:  
  
Word: Sub-Saharan Africa.  
  
Infraction: Bush's Malaria Plan provides aid to: Angola, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Benin, Ethiopia (Oromia Region), Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia. (  http://www.fightingmalaria.gov...  ) Now, these are all Sub-Saharan countries, but the real problem is... there are 33 other countries in SSA. Obviously the Pro is not providing aid to Sub-Saharan Africa if they just give aid to 1/3 of the countries. The Pro's plan text no where says anything about expanding the Malaria Plan's targets for all of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Con must therefore assume that the only countries tackled by the plan are the ones tackled by the current plan. Thusly, the Pro does not give public health assistance to all of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and is un-topical.  
  
2. Justification:  
""action must be taken"" is the phrase I really want to center in on. Assuming Pro wants to stay topical, they advocate the U.S. as the actor. However, because of burden of proof, the Pro is required to justify that U.S. action is superior to either inaction or action by another actor.

First off- The education problem of today's debate has been not very clear so I will put a few statements on that matter. Sources: <URL>... ... This source here explains how our educational system is actually doing quite well contrary to the Pro's thoughts. Also the debate topic i pulling away troops from the war on terror so I'm not sure how building schools today has anything to do with the military and it's involvement in the war on terror. Secondly with our ""failing banks"" Sources: <URL>... ... According to this our banks are doing fine so what is the deal? Well though employment my be down as long as our banks are okay we will overcome this and everything will be fixed. So our banks are fine therefore America will be okay in the end contrary to the Pro's thoughts. Thirdly with the terrorists not able to get money if America pulls out. Sources: <URL>... ... Taliban poppy supply it's plain and simple. The Taliban are getting their money from these poppy seeds not the U.S. military so even if we leave they will get even more money then ever. It is better for us to stay and finish the job. You say that the terrorists are not able to get money and are poor, but they are getting tons of money form these poppy seeds which proves my case even further. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay to restate my case which seems to stand even more now. First off with the spending of the U.S. Dollar is causing us to fall behind. What are we falling behind on? I am going to put it this way, Say you leader of a group of important people and one of these people falls behind and is not able to reap any kind of benefit and you have the know how to get that person to get a better life. Shouldn't it be the leaders job and responsibility to help the person into gaining those benefits of life? Now lets put that with the U.S. We are the leading country of the world militarily, as the leader it is our responsibility to help those who don't have their full potential out. Just as the leader of the people should help if able, the U.S. should help as the leader. Other wise we forfeit our role as leader because we are unable to help others. Okay lets go to spending the money on our own country: The U.S. Government has raised the debt threshold time and time again so that we can borrow money from other countries. If you want the money to be spent elsewhere we take it from the job that America was meant for and get our leadership aka the Government to stop borrowing money and focus and helping our economy for the better. Okay now one of my favorite subjects to argue about: Health care: What is health care, well it is a privilege. No health care is not a right. How have we fallen behind in health care? This can be answered very simply by the universal health care bill. What does this do? I caused the Government to spend money on the people who can't spare a dime. Because the American people can't pay for this what do they do? They borrow money from other countries. Again this proves my point about wasting our money. Now you may think, but what about the poor people who can't pay for it. Did you know that most of the people who get on a government paid program like to stay there because it means no work for them. Lets face it most people are lazy. Don;t get me wrong the people working and trying to get out of poverty are going to get out soon enough. others though will stay and suck up our taxes. You say our money is wasted on the military, look to America and see what is truly causing this. On to your point about fixing ourselves and that we can't fix others: My previous points explain the way to fix ourselves not phasing out the military. The military should stay strong as it always has. tapering with it causes an unbalance in the global affairs. Look to America fix what it here. I have never disagreed with helping other, but if these people we are trying to help in America are taking the money and not tying to help themselves. Why I ask are we supposed to continue giving then more money through more bills and now health care. And now on the education: I have proved this point with my first point of my rebuttal so there is not need to restate it in the same argument. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: <URL>... ...... <URL>... ...... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a restatement of my previous arguments.

252,"America is a nation that has been ravaged by crime, a nation in which homicide rates are, per thousand, almost four times as large as homicide rates in the UK and rates which are pretty only topped in the developed world by countries like Russia. [1]We say this is especially surprising given that the US has a well-funded police force and some pretty tough deterrents like the death penalty for murder. So we say that the underlying cause of these high crime rates is the abundance of guns we see in the USA, which I'll discuss later. I thank LAISSEZFAIRE for taking up the CON side of this debate. The Pro has three main arguments today; whether people have a right to have guns, in the constitution or in a modern society, the decrease in spontaneous crime rates our model will cause and the effects on both petty and organized crime. Firstly, to the right to bear arms, and we have two levels of analysis on this point: the constitutional right to bear arms and the modern right. So firstly, we say that when the constitution was written there was an overwhelming right to bear arms. The 2nd amendment was a descendent of a war-faring, fledgling nation that relied upon civilian militia in its war efforts. However, we say that in a modern society in which we have an established armed forces, a police force and where this model only applies to the urban areas in which these services are readily available, the 2nd amendment of the constitution is obsolete because such different circumstances apply. But secondly, I expect that my opponent will argue that citizens even living in the America of today have a right to firearms. We on the Pro side believe that indeed, the government has a responsibility to restrict this right. The right to having weapons is never absolute, and we can see this in the fact that having advanced weaponry like tanks isn't allowed. But moreover we say that there is no reason why anyone would need a gun. There are two justifications normally given as to why people would need guns; defending against nature and self-defence. On the first point, we stated in our model that the restriction wouldn't apply to rural areas, and we think this justification doesn't really matter. On the second, we say that while some crime will still happen under our model, the need to defend one's self is so rarely used that it doesn't matter, and, furthermore, we say that even when this right is used, it's done so poorly that often the person with the gun or their close family are injured. Furthermore, there are alternatives to guns as far as self-defence goes. And even if our opposition could prove that this right does exist, we would say it needs to be restricted because allowing a free flow of guns endangers rights to personal safety and indeed the right to life itself. We think that a very questionable right to have guns when they are largely unnecessary pales in comparison to the right to personal safety the broader population has. Secondly, we think our model will massively decrease spontaneous crime rates. We say that when there are guns freely available, it makes crime that much easier to participate in. When we consider America's crime rates, as I discussed earlier, we can see that they are much higher than those of other nations. Law-abiding citizens can be led astray by having guns around them, and that they often do make irrational decisions and kill people using guns who they wouldn't if guns were not so easily available. In fact, according to the research completed by emergency doctors, there is a 43:1 ratio of aiming at and shooting an innocent person than an actual criminal. [2] Thirdly, how will our model affect both petty and organized crime? We think that the gun market will be largely eradicated in America. This is because we not only stop people from buying guns in America but we can also stop guns from being imported into the country, which will also be prohibited. The only people who will be able to receive any guns will be farmers living in rural areas. However, I expect my opponent will argue that some gun trade will continue to exist, which we do not accept, but, even so, when you reduce the number of guns legally sold, we say two things happen to the supply of guns; it decreases as whole so less gun crime can happen and furthermore we drive up the price of any remaining guns, which will make it much harder for small-time petty criminals to get their hands on guns. As to the effect on organized crime, we say police will be able to better attack gangs and the like when their very lifeblood is made illegal, and we say that this will stop organized crime.

America is a nation that has been ravaged by crime, a nation in which homicide rates are, per thousand, almost four times as large as homicide rates in the UK and rates which are pretty only topped in the developed world by countries like Russia. [1]We say this is especially surprising given that the US has a well-funded police force and some pretty tough deterrents like the death penalty for murder. So we say that the underlying cause of these high crime rates is the abundance of guns we see in the USA, which I'll discuss later.  
  
I thank LAISSEZFAIRE for taking up the CON side of this debate.  
  
The Pro has three main arguments today; whether people have a right to have guns, in the constitution or in a modern society, the decrease in spontaneous crime rates our model will cause and the effects on both petty and organized crime.  
  
Firstly, to the right to bear arms, and we have two levels of analysis on this point: the constitutional right to bear arms and the modern right. So firstly, we say that when the constitution was written there was an overwhelming right to bear arms. The 2nd amendment was a descendent of a war-faring, fledgling nation that relied upon civilian militia in its war efforts. However, we say that in a modern society in which we have an established armed forces, a police force and where this model only applies to the urban areas in which these services are readily available, the 2nd amendment of the constitution is obsolete because such different circumstances apply. But secondly, I expect that my opponent will argue that citizens even living in the America of today have a right to firearms. We on the Pro side believe that indeed, the government has a responsibility to restrict this right. The right to having weapons is never absolute, and we can see this in the fact that having advanced weaponry like tanks isn't allowed. But moreover we say that there is no reason why anyone would need a gun. There are two justifications normally given as to why people would need guns; defending against nature and self-defence. On the first point, we stated in our model that the restriction wouldn't apply to rural areas, and we think this justification doesn't really matter. On the second, we say that while some crime will still happen under our model, the need to defend one's self is so rarely used that it doesn't matter, and, furthermore, we say that even when this right is used, it's done so poorly that often the person with the gun or their close family are injured. Furthermore, there are alternatives to guns as far as self-defence goes. And even if our opposition could prove that this right does exist, we would say it needs to be restricted because allowing a free flow of guns endangers rights to personal safety and indeed the right to life itself. We think that a very questionable right to have guns when they are largely unnecessary pales in comparison to the right to personal safety the broader population has.  
  
Secondly, we think our model will massively decrease spontaneous crime rates. We say that when there are guns freely available, it makes crime that much easier to participate in. When we consider America's crime rates, as I discussed earlier, we can see that they are much higher than those of other nations. Law-abiding citizens can be led astray by having guns around them, and that they often do make irrational decisions and kill people using guns who they wouldn't if guns were not so easily available. In fact, according to the research completed by emergency doctors, there is a 43:1 ratio of aiming at and shooting an innocent person than an actual criminal. [2]  
  
Thirdly, how will our model affect both petty and organized crime? We think that the gun market will be largely eradicated in America. This is because we not only stop people from buying guns in America but we can also stop guns from being imported into the country, which will also be prohibited. The only people who will be able to receive any guns will be farmers living in rural areas. However, I expect my opponent will argue that some gun trade will continue to exist, which we do not accept, but, even so, when you reduce the number of guns legally sold, we say two things happen to the supply of guns; it decreases as whole so less gun crime can happen and furthermore we drive up the price of any remaining guns, which will make it much harder for small-time petty criminals to get their hands on guns. As to the effect on organized crime, we say police will be able to better attack gangs and the like when their very lifeblood is made illegal, and we say that this will stop organized crime. We think that our model will reduce petty and organized crime.  
  
Because there is no right to arms and because our model will reduce crime we are proud to propose.

Unfortunately this is the last round and we won't be able to go into specifics regarding the issue, but if there were any conclusive contradictions (that list of however many hundred that floats around the internet every once in a while doesn't count; none of those hold any water), I would think 2000 years of critical reading as the bestselling book ever would bring them to wide light. The differences in interpretation and translation that you point out - the Genesis one, for example - are examples of the sort of interpretation of the core that defines denominations one from another (or at least sects, if not formal denominations), not of departures from the core as Mormonism has done. If I hold that the earth was created in a literal six-day period and my neighbor holds that the earth was instead created as a separation from uniformity on the basis of that verse, we both still take the Bible as the core text to the Christian faith, despite our different interpretations. The interpretation of 2 Timothy 3:16 is a little different though since that refers to the core itself. However, it seems like a big stretch grammatically to consider 'correction' to refer to the scriptures, when the words on either side of it obviously refer to readers of Scripture rather than the scriptures themselves. It doesn't necessarily follow that the transcription of the New Testament by literate non-professionals makes errors inevitable; rather, the innumerable copies, which would have been copied from many copies of the original, make it extremely unlikely that an error - especially a theological one - would propagate through the copies we have today.

This is where the argument turns back to Biblical interpretation regarding the Mormon issue, for it looks like your proof of discluding the Bible from the definition of Christianity consisted of establishing the Bible as errant (whether or not it was intentionally inspired to be so), which has not been done. It looks like you as well believe that Mormonism is irreconcilable to the Scriptures and our debate thus boils down to the role of the Scriptures in defining a Christian, which hinges on this primary issue of Biblical errancy.

My reason for engaging the topic at this level is to level the playing field and give the topic an actual reason for debate, to discuss the worthiness and potential effects of the package passed by Congress. My opponent reduces the topic to a semantic interpretation for the sake of winning an equation, versus actually discussing the merits of the impending package. Success, even under his interpretation implies a comparison to two other elements, doing nothing, or doing something else. I take issue with both alternatives, which he effectively ignores. I also consider whether this package could make things worse, which he dismisses due to a logistical constraint of time. If the result of the package is an extension or worsening of the pending recession, then the resolution should be rejected on face. Now, onto the economic discussion. Restating refuted arguments does not constitute an argument. My opponent places the consumer spending argument in a vacuum, and ignores all other economic variables like inflation, savings rates, etc. I'm assuming he has accepted GDP as the measure of slowdown mitigation, and yet he has yet to prove that a 1-11% increase in consumer spending would result in a sufficient gain of GDP to merit affirming the resolution. As I have proven, other economic factors, particularly inflation and our countries high debt ratio's will likely prevent such spending from having much effect at all. The second stated goal, regarding business investment has never really been refuted, especially in the sections where any business investment wouldn't yield economic returns (if they do) in the coming year. He makes blanket statements about businesses adjusting budgets and buying equipment, but doesn't substantiate any of them. A simple financial accounting class would reveal that these type of investments usually don't bear fruit until several quarters have passed. Just buying a tractor doesn't boost the economy. Finally, my opponent actually agrees that this package could extend or repeat the housing bubble, but dismisses this due to time constraints. This speaks to the fundamental disagreement we have with this topic. If the stimulus package actually makes our economy worse, regardless of the time frame, the resolution should be rejected on face. Otherwise, the comparative value of the package falls versus the alternative of doing nothing and letting the correction pass naturally or perhaps doing something that actually addresses the problems our economy faces. Affirming the resolution amounts to placing a band aid on a wound that has come dangerously close to an artery. The economic stimulus package is a waste of taxpayer dollars and will do little to nothing to impact the pending economic slowdown over the next year. Worse, it will likely exacerbate this recession, due to delaying the necessary corrections in the housing & financial markets, and possibly worsening our inflation by injecting more cash into the system by inflating our budget deficits.

261,"My opponent, despite earlier promises, has still not addressed many of the points made in my first argument. Specifically, he has not refuted my assertions that there were better and less destructive ways to deal with Al Qa'ida than invading the nation of Afghanistan, bombing cities, and killing thousands of innocent civilians. Neither has he justified the killings of those thousands of Afghanis. He will not address the causes of terror which I have brought up many times and has not responded to my assertion that invading Afghanistan could lead to more anti-American terrorists. Finally, he did not reply to my questioning of how much the world was helped by simply overthrowing one pro-terrorist, oppressive regime with no guarantee that it will not be replaced by another of the same sort. That being said, I will now reply to the points made in his most recent argument. Hegemonic America: My opponent assumes that because America is powerful, it has a ""responsibility"" to the rest of the world to be its protector and policeman. Why is this so? Simply being a powerful nation does not give a nation the moral authority to intervene in the rest of the world for the cause of ""good"" (which translates to ""whatever it wants"" in the real world). But let us assume for a moment that the United States has a responsibility to promote freedom and such throughout the world. If this is so, should we not invade Iran? North Korea? China? Sudan? Russia? DR Congo? There are 43 countries and 8 disputed territories rated ""Not Free"" by Freedom House. 60 countries and 6 disputed territories are rated ""Partly Free"" (and thus partly Not Free). Are we to invade over 100 nations to ensure that freedom exists throughout the world? If not, why do we get to use this excuse with some countries? I will also accept for the moment the idea that the Taliban is partly responsible for 9/11 because of their support of Al Qa'ida. But again, I must ask, how are the thousands of Afghanis killed by our indiscriminate bombs responsible for 9/11? How is that ""defense"" when they have done nothing?

Obligations: America's intervention in foreign affairs has caused untold amount of oppressive governments to arise. That was the point of my lesson. If we accept my opponent's reasoning, the United States needs to invade essentially all of Africa, as its many oppressive regimes exist in large part because the United States forced the European powers to decolonize. We should invade most of the Middle East under the same idea. Are these positions not ridiculous? America has caused so many problems in the world. Many of them caused by the USA ""fixing"" other problems. Why should we keep doing the same thing and expect different results? That is the behavior of someone who is insane.

What happened to the Soviet Union is what must happen to all communist regimes - it imploded on itself. Socialism cannot work. It has no price system to coordinate it and will thus always collapse economically. The Soviet Union collapsed because of its economic policies, not because of some mythological war of ideology waged by the USA. Indeed, the USA has moved closer and closer to the economic system of the Soviet Union every year. In fact, the developed world as a whole has moved in this direction. Look at healthcare. Those who do not support socialism are considered reactionary and uncaring. Wars of ideology are brutal, much like wars of religion. They must be, because the goal is not conquest or anything tangible, but rather to change the ""hearts and minds"" of a group of people. How can this be assured? Well, the only way to truly assure this is to kill everyone in the group. After all, they could just be lying. The only way we can be sure is killing them all, which is actually explicitly advocated by some. Surely this barbarism can be rejected out of hand by sensible people. As to the lives we saved - how can we know? All we know for sure is that we murdered thousands of innocents. That alone makes this an unjust war.",0,Morty,"
  
My opponent, despite earlier promises, has still not addressed many of the points made in my first argument. Specifically, he has not refuted my assertions that there were better and less destructive ways to deal with Al Qa'ida than invading the nation of Afghanistan, bombing cities, and killing thousands of innocent civilians. Neither has he justified the killings of those thousands of Afghanis. He will not address the causes of terror which I have brought up many times and has not responded to my assertion that invading Afghanistan could lead to more anti-American terrorists. Finally, he did not reply to my questioning of how much the world was helped by simply overthrowing one pro-terrorist, oppressive regime with no guarantee that it will not be replaced by another of the same sort.  
  
That being said, I will now reply to the points made in his most recent argument.  
  
Hegemonic America:  
My opponent assumes that because America is powerful, it has a ""responsibility"" to the rest of the world to be its protector and policeman. Why is this so? Simply being a powerful nation does not give a nation the moral authority to intervene in the rest of the world for the cause of ""good"" (which translates to ""whatever it wants"" in the real world).  
But let us assume for a moment that the United States has a responsibility to promote freedom and such throughout the world. If this is so, should we not invade Iran? North Korea? China? Sudan?

Let's address these issues then:  
  
1.Silverstein made comments to ""pull it"" in reference to building 7  
  
2.When Silverstein bought the WTC he also insured it at the same time, this is usually what you do when you buy a property, contrary to my opponent's opinion that you buy property and then insure it later.  
  
3.Building 7 was never struck by a plane, yet it collapsed in 7 seconds. My opponent claims it was 13 seconds, but either way, it collapsed at free fall speed.  
  
It seems he is so overwhelmed by them that they seem like more than he can handle.  
  
<<""I haven't seen any evidence of molten steel, at the towers"". Seems factual to me. Have you seen the evidence? If so provide it. If you are using the ""evidence"" in the video then I will address those:

Really? It could be aluminum? Do you have any references or proof to back up your claim? Or are you hypothesizing? This is only your opinion. In fact the proof I have provided is much more consistent with Thermite reactions than ""aluminum"" !!

What he says is that while your argument seems to be perfect, it's perfect because of an illusion of language. Meaning, it is true, but it doesn't MEAN anything. It is similar saying 1 = 1, and 2 = 2. An analogy: My super kitchen appliance can do lots and lots of things, but in order for it to do ANYTHING, it has to be plugged in. Similarly, God is defined to have a lot of characteristics. However, his characteristics only start to count when he exists. Thus, if you are trying to prove that God exists, you cannot say that since God has the power to exist, he exists. God has to exist FIRST, and after you prove that, THEN you can call his abilities into play. To be even simpler, I am saying that existence is not a characteristic. If you list the characteristics of something, you don't include ""existence"" in that list. The reasoning is illustrated by the unicorn example. What happens when you learn that a concept of yours has a new characteristic? If you find out your favorite shirt has a hole, then your concept of your favorite shirt gets an addition: the hole. Does this same reasoning happen when you talk about existence? No. The concept of a unicorn is ""Horse with a horn in its forehead"" and you are unsure of whether or not it exists. If you see a unicorn one day, then you know it exists. Does your concept change? Of course not. The concept does not become ""Horse with a horn in its forehead that exists"". So SOMETHING must have changed. The change occurs with different thinking. You linked the concept of the unicorn with the physical fact of the unicorn. Thus, this shows that existence is not a characteristic or definable trait. You cannot use God's omnipotence to show that God exists, just like how you cannot use a Super Kitchen appliance without plugging it in, or how you cannot add toppings on a pizza if the pizza has not been made.

284,"Introduction I will accept the measurements of what makes a good drug. I ask that the voters, weight each of these measurements equally while judging the arguments portion of the debate. Since my opponent is stipulating a specific type of Marijuana use (vaporized or drank from a tea), then I will specify a specific type of use for my drug. I choose Adderall for adult usage only and dosages that don't exceed 20 milligrams. I will also be relabeling area 7 of the points my opponent made (The X Factor). 1 Health Risk The health risks for Adderall are very minimal, and when you look at the health benefits it's actually a net gain health wise. As opposed to Marijuana where the health affects at best are neutral. In the United States over 1/3 of all adults are obese [1]. With one of the side effects of Adderall being loss of appetite [2], the obesity epidemic would also come to a sharp decline, if Adderal were much more widely used. According to the CDC one of the top killers every year is accidents, with a total of about 120,000 a year [3]. With one of the side affects of Adderall being increased focus [2]. It is very likely that people wouldn't be as easily distracted. This reduction of distractions would lead to a decreased amount of accidental deaths. Over 4% of people have undiagnosed ADHD[4]. This number doesn't even include the amount of diagnosed ADHD. If you use Adderall (an ADHD medicine) then there is probably a good chance that by using Adderall recreationally, there is a good chance you'll be accidently treating an undiagnosed condition. 2. Risk of overdose Just like Marijuana, Adderall when not exceeding the limits I discussed has close to a 0% chance of overdose. When taking into account the health benefits Adderal does better then, not killing you. It reduces your chances of death. 3. Enjoyment This category is pretty subjective. While a lot of people get a good feeling from Adderall, it isn't like a high from weed or a buzz from drinking. The joy you get from doing Adderal actually comes from the fact you'll have a better life. Adderall dramatically improves productivity [2]. With your increased productivity it's very likely your income will rise, you'll be more organized and you'll be able to put more energy into your relationships. The enjoyment you get from Adderall isn't only from the immediate effects. A lot of joy comes from the overall improvement of your life in almost every category. 4. Side Effects The side effects are awesome. Weed makes you hungry then you over eat and then get fat. Adderall reduces appetite and you can get your buzz while remaining thin. Weed makes you sleepy and lazy, Adderall makes you wide awake and extremely productive. I'm doing 8 debates right now, I just cleaned my entire house, I work 50 hours a week, and I still have time to take my pool playing hobby very seriously, also I have plenty of time for sex. The side effects of Adderall blow the effects of weed right out of the water. 5. Personality on the drug Unlike weed Adderall makes people more focused in conversation. It helps you to pay closer attention to what people are saying. When you talk to pot heads all they want to talk about is Bob Marley, the CIA dealing drugs, and far out ridiculous conspiracy theories. I'd much rather talk to someone who will listen to me, then one who is going to randomly start talking about fluoride in my drinking water. The zoned out Pot head personality is completely unbearable, while the super focused attentive Adderall user is always fun to talk to. The personality of Adderall user's are better also because they have more time and energy to invest in their relationships. If you start using Adderall you are more focused on conversations, hang out with friends more, and be able to focus on your significant other better. Adderall is truly a miracle for your social life among other things. 6. Productivity Adderall completely crushes weed when it comes to productivity. Look at the Adderall us among the top performing college students. The reason Adderall is so highly abused among college students is because it increases productivity. This is not a theory it has been proven [4]. Adderall also increases your productivity at work [2]. We're no longer talking about the rare person who can make millions singing a song. Now we are talking about your average Joe working or going to school. Adderall increase productivity for everyone, not just super stars. In your face weed! 7. The X Factor You can obtain Adderall almost everywhere without going to the ghetto and having to hand your money to a shady drug dealer. I can Google the symptoms of ADHD walk into a doctor's office and boom, get a prescription. Then I go get my fix at Wal-Mart. What happens if I get caught with Adderall after I leave Wal-Mart? Not a thing I show the cops my prescription give them the bird and go on my way. What happens if you get caught with weed? You go to jail, disqualify yourself from being able to get a wide array of jobs, and ruin your chance at several institutions of higher learning. Worst of all you can't give the cops the bird because your hands are cuffed behind your back. I will be saving all my rebuttals for the next round, out of fairness to my opponent. Thank you.

  Introduction  
  
I will accept the measurements of what makes a good drug. I ask that the voters, weight each of these measurements equally while judging the arguments portion of the debate. Since my opponent is stipulating a specific type of Marijuana use (vaporized or drank from a tea), then I will specify a specific type of use for my drug. I choose Adderall for adult usage only and dosages that don't exceed 20 milligrams. I will also be relabeling area 7 of the points my opponent made (The X Factor).  
  
  1 Health Risk  
  
The health risks for Adderall are very minimal, and when you look at the health benefits it's actually a net gain health wise. As opposed to Marijuana where the health affects at best are neutral. In the United States over 1/3 of all adults are obese [1]. With one of the side effects of Adderall being loss of appetite [2], the obesity epidemic would also come to a sharp decline, if Adderal were much more widely used. According to the CDC one of the top killers every year is accidents, with a total of about 120,000 a year [3]. With one of the side affects of Adderall being increased focus [2]. It is very likely that people wouldn't be as easily distracted. This reduction of distractions would lead to a decreased amount of accidental deaths. Over 4% of people have undiagnosed ADHD[4]. This number doesn't even include the amount of diagnosed ADHD. If you use Adderall (an ADHD medicine) then there is probably a good chance that by using Adderall recreationally, there is a good chance you'll be accidently treating an undiagnosed condition.  
  
  2. Risk of overdose  
  
Just like Marijuana, Adderall when not exceeding the limits I discussed has close to a 0% chance of overdose. When taking into account the health benefits Adderal does better then, not killing you. It reduces your chances of death.  
  
  3. Enjoyment  
  
This category is pretty subjective. While a lot of people get a good feeling from Adderall, it isn't like a high from weed or a buzz from drinking. The joy you get from doing Adderal actually comes from the fact you'll have a better life. Adderall dramatically improves productivity [2]. With your increased productivity it's very likely your income will rise, you'll be more organized and you'll be able to put more energy into your relationships. The enjoyment you get from Adderall isn't only from the immediate effects. A lot of joy comes from the overall improvement of your life in almost every category.  
  
  4. Side Effects  
  
The side effects are awesome. Weed makes you hungry then you over eat and then get fat. Adderall reduces appetite and you can get your buzz while remaining thin. Weed makes you sleepy and lazy, Adderall makes you wide awake and extremely productive. I'm doing 8 debates right now, I just cleaned my entire house, I work 50 hours a week, and I still have time to take my pool playing hobby very seriously, also I have plenty of time for sex. The side effects of Adderall blow the effects of weed right out of the water.  
  
  5. Personality on the drug  
  
Unlike weed Adderall makes people more focused in conversation. It helps you to pay closer attention to what people are saying. When you talk to pot heads all they want to talk about is Bob Marley, the CIA dealing drugs, and far out ridiculous conspiracy theories. I'd much rather talk to someone who will listen to me, then one who is going to randomly start talking about fluoride in my drinking water. The zoned out Pot head personality is completely unbearable, while the super focused attentive Adderall user is always fun to talk to. The personality of Adderall user's are better also because they have more time and energy to invest in their relationships. If you start using Adderall you are more focused on conversations, hang out with friends more, and be able to focus on your significant other better. Adderall is truly a miracle for your social life among other things.  
  
  6. Productivity  
  
Adderall completely crushes weed when it comes to productivity. Look at the Adderall us among the top performing college students. The reason Adderall is so highly abused among college students is because it increases productivity. This is not a theory it has been proven [4]. Adderall also increases your productivity at work [2]. We're no longer talking about the rare person who can make millions singing a song. Now we are talking about your average Joe working or going to school. Adderall increase productivity for everyone, not just super stars. In your face weed!  
  
  7. The X Factor  
  
You can obtain Adderall almost everywhere without going to the ghetto and having to hand your money to a shady drug dealer. I can Google the symptoms of ADHD walk into a doctor's office and boom, get a prescription. Then I go get my fix at Wal-Mart. What happens if I get caught with Adderall after I leave Wal-Mart?

One thing before we begin: notice my opponent's slimy tactic here. ""Now that someone has indeed accepted the debate, I can reveal the statistical support for my arguments"". My opponent has clearly adopted a strategy based in deception and omission. Conduct point to Con. Now then, on to the good stuff! (And I appreciate my opponent's conformity to my numbering/lettering format) 1. Morality a. The assertion underlying my opponent is making is that murdering another man is a forfeiture of the right to life on the spot; if this were the case, then any law abiding citizen would have the authority to take the murderer's life, as he would have forfeited that right. Remember that, according to the Fifth Amendment, no one can be deprived of life (among other rights) without due process first; this means that a man doesn't automatically ""forfeit"" his rights. On top of that, my opponent still fails to prove the legitimacy of the status quo; a court may decide on the death penalty, but that is hardly adequate justification. Responding to murder with a second murder is hardly moral; again, two wrongs do not make a right, regardless of the legality. b. On my analogy, Pro argues that I shouldn't compare human life to material things. A couple of arguments here: i) First of all, I'd like to direct you to Pro's 4th argument, *WHICH HE DROPS*: he argues here that the death penalty is justified because it is saving money that would otherwise be used for life imprisonment; if anyone is trying to put a dollar value on human life, it would be Pro. ii) Pro also mistakes my intentions here. I am simply saying that, while ""proportional"", so to speak, murdering a murderer makes as much sense as stealing a thief's possessions. Proportionality =/= Justification. c. Pro's response validates my point completely. Both Pro and our ""justice"" system would condemn these men to death without providing a chance for contrition, repentance, or redemption. Pro is making an entirely unwarranted generalization about murderers which presupposes a mental capacity inadequate for rehabilitation. The cynical mindset of the justice system is what needs to be put to death. 2. Retribution a. Pro ignores the main argument that I'm making here. The purpose of the justice system is, ideally, to make an impartial decision - not to satisfy the lust for vengeance possessed by the victim's loved ones. The ""bonus"" of satisfying the family is hardly adequate reason to support the death penalty. b. Pull through the Bazemore evidence, discussing how the victim (or the family) is peripheral in the process, so a retributive system of justice can't advocate something based on the level of satisfaction enjoyed by the family. 3. Deterrence a. Sure, I'll grant my opponent that there's a correlation; however, we all know that correlation doesn't imply causation, especially considering the maelstrom of recent evidence that I provided in Round 1 suggesting the opposite of Pro's claims. My opponent's graph might just come down to this: the decrease in violent crimes in NON-death penalty states could simply outweigh the increase in murder rate in PRO-death penalty states. That would support the data from both of our sources (as executions rise in death penalty states, violent crime rates fall in non-death penalty states), but the argument overall would still go Con. b. After reading through Pro's evidence, I came upon a most interesting quote regarding these so-called ""findings"": ""'We just don't have enough data to say anything,' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the Wharton School of Business who last year co-authored a sweeping critique of several studies, and said they were 'flimsy' and appeared in 'second-tier journals.'"" Look at the evidence I've provided here. 88% of expert criminologists concur that the death penalty doesn't deter violent crime, despite what these ""flimsy"" studies might suggest. c. Pro's response here has nothing to do with my argument, which was that, when faced with the death penalty, would-be murderers often adopt this ""go-for-broke"" mentality, since they have nothing left to lose, and no opportunities to look for once the death sentence is given. As far as the response he makes, I've already given a situation above that satisfies both his evidence and mine, showing that this argument goes Con. My multiple pieces of long term evidence show us that states with high murder rates didn't just recently ""revert"" to the death penalty. The trend is clear, and it supports the Con position. 4. Cost Again, I would just like to point out that Pro has dropped this entire argument. Don't allow him to come and ""pick it back up"" in later rounds. To briefly recap: a. Ethical justifications are not based upon economic gains (especially noting my opponent's earlier argument that human life cannot be compared to material goods). b. Even law enforcement admits that the death penalty is ""the least efficient use of taxpayers' money"". c. Refer to all of the statistics I posted in Round 1, all showing that the use of the death penalty is actually far more expensive than the maintenance of a LIP inmate. 5. One Other Thing a. Once again, we notice that my opponent's logic is flawed, and he draws huge non sequiturs from his misrepresentations of findings concerning the death penalty (findings which, may I remind you, were conveniently and deceptively omitted from his Round 1 arguments). If you want reliability in evidence and reason, you'll vote Con here, too. In conclusion, Con clearly has the conduct, argument, and source points (Spelling and Grammar hasn't been an issue thus far). You might not think so, Pro, but I would contend that this debate has already been decided. In spite of that, good luck in Round 3. :)",0,Cody_Franklin,"

309,"As a policy debater my favorite thing in the world to do was to create Kritiks. Specifically I loved to create squirrel Kritiks, in other words Kritiks that no one else would have evidence on. The best of these was by far my Hawking Kritik which stated, as Hawking has pointed out, the long term survival of the human population is dependent on our ability to colonize other stellar systems or bodies. Eventually life on our earth will end, whether this occurs through an asteroid collision, nuclear war, or simple over population it none the less cannot go on forever. Thus of course the main problem with my Kritik was finding the viable alternative, something that took me days of research but I finally attained. A. THERE ARE OVER 17,000 POSSIBLE NEARBY HABITABLE STELLAR SYSTEMS- Turnbull & Tarter '03 [Margaret C. Turnbull, Jim C.Tarter, University of Arizona, SETI institute, ""Target Selection for SETI. I. A Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems"", 2003, <URL>... ] The primary topics of this dissertation are (1) target selection for searches for extrasolar life, especially for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and (2) remote detection of biosignatures, especially with regard to TPF. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the field of astrobiology, and to the search for life on other planets. Chapters 2 and 3 ask, ""What are the best places in the Universe to search for Earth-like life?"" A class of stars, ""habstars,"" is defined as stellar systems that are potentially habitable to Earth-like complex life. The physical properties of habstars are derived from the biological requirement of habitable zone stability, and these properties are translated into observable characteristics. In Chapter 2, the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems (HabCat), containing ~17,000 ""habstars"" within 300 parsecs, is presented for use as a new target list for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence with the Allen Telescope Array. In Chapter 3, HabCat is augmented with other targets of interest, including a list of ~250,000 stars within 1000 parsecs from the Tycho-2 Catalog that are likely to be main-sequence (based on their proper motions) F, G, K and M stars (based on their B-V colors), old open clusters, and the nearest 100 stars. With over 17,000 NEARBY habitable stellar systems it is quite possible that one of them has life on it. Furthermore as the number one factor of life on earth is considered to be water and of the 8 planets we know that Mercury reportedly has water in protected craters. Venus at one point had water. Earth has water. Mars has icecaps and 0.03% H20 in its atmosphere. Jupiter has trace ammounts of water in its atmosphere. Saturn also has trace amounts in the atmosphere and its rings are primarily composed of water. Uranus has no water and Neptune supposedly has water in its middle layers. And of the 3 dwarf planets we know that pluto is made of 30% water ice, Ceres hasn't been visited yet, and neither has Eris.

As a policy debater my favorite thing in the world to do was to create Kritiks. Specifically I loved to create squirrel Kritiks, in other words Kritiks that no one else would have evidence on.  
  
The best of these was by far my Hawking Kritik which stated, as Hawking has pointed out, the long term survival of the human population is dependent on our ability to colonize other stellar systems or bodies. Eventually life on our earth will end, whether this occurs through an asteroid collision, nuclear war, or simple over population it none the less cannot go on forever.  
  
Thus of course the main problem with my Kritik was finding the viable alternative, something that took me days of research but I finally attained.  
  
A. THERE ARE OVER 17,000 POSSIBLE NEARBY HABITABLE STELLAR SYSTEMS- Turnbull & Tarter '03  
[Margaret C. Turnbull, Jim C.Tarter, University of Arizona, SETI institute, ""Target Selection for SETI. I. A Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems"", 2003,   http://adsabs.harvard.edu...  ]  
  
The primary topics of this dissertation are (1) target selection for searches for extrasolar life, especially for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and (2) remote detection of biosignatures, especially with regard to TPF. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the field of astrobiology, and to the search for life on other planets. Chapters 2 and 3 ask, ""What are the best places in the Universe to search for Earth-like life?"" A class of stars, ""habstars,"" is defined as stellar systems that are potentially habitable to Earth-like complex life. The physical properties of habstars are derived from the biological requirement of habitable zone stability, and these properties are translated into observable characteristics. In Chapter 2, the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems (HabCat), containing ~17,000 ""habstars"" within 300 parsecs, is presented for use as a new target list for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence with the Allen Telescope Array. In Chapter 3, HabCat is augmented with other targets of interest, including a list of ~250,000 stars within 1000 parsecs from the Tycho-2 Catalog that are likely to be main-sequence (based on their proper motions) F, G, K and M stars (based on their B-V colors), old open clusters, and the nearest 100 stars.  
  
With over 17,000 NEARBY habitable stellar systems it is quite possible that one of them has life on it. Furthermore as the number one factor of life on earth is considered to be water and of the 8 planets we know that Mercury reportedly has water in protected craters. Venus at one point had water. Earth has water. Mars has icecaps and 0.03% H20 in its atmosphere. Jupiter has trace ammounts of water in its atmosphere. Saturn also has trace amounts in the atmosphere and its rings are primarily composed of water. Uranus has no water and Neptune supposedly has water in its middle layers. And of the 3 dwarf planets we know that pluto is made of 30% water ice, Ceres hasn't been visited yet, and neither has Eris. Furthermore the moons: Ganymede, Mimas, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Puck, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, Stephano, Trinculo, Triton, all have a percentage of water ice on them or are primarily made of such and the moons: Phobos, Europa (possibly 50 km depth of liquid water under the surface), Charon all probably have some amount of water.  
  
With the above in mind it is more than likely that at least a few of the 17,000 nearby potentially habitable stellar bodies have water on them and are close enough to an energy source to create the right conditions for life.  
  
Thus I have no choice but to negate my opponents comments and point out the logical fallacy. Of the 8 planets that we can readily observe 1 of them definitely has life. As this is the only empirical evidence we have the likely observation would be that 1 in 8 planets have life. Therefor my opponents case stating this is so entirely unlikely that it is not even possible is completely and utterly flawed.

Your most striking piece of evidence is this picture: <URL>... Which has been claimed to be a mixture of molten iron and aluminum oxide produced by thermite. That is an extremely rash conclusion to come to, and I can show it to be extremely unlikely. First, I want to impress on you exactly why thermite is used in controlled demolitions. It is not meant to liquefy vast pillars of steel and turn the entire support structure into a fluid. Thermite charges are used in pairs, displacing a section of a steel pillar so that the rest of the building above can fall a couple feet. Then gravity does the rest. The small amount of liquid steel produced solidifies quickly. The idea that a thermite demolition produces flowing rivers of liquid metal is ridiculous. The thermite itself is held by a binder, preventing much of it from moving. Look at that picture. It would take TONS of thermite to produce that much slag, many times more than would be necessary to take down the entire WTC building, let alone a single tiny section of it. So the stuff pouring out of the window in that picture isn't thermite. Then what is it? We need to think of something that would have been present in huge quantities all around the building. Something that could have been produced by the temperatures already created by burning jet fuel and office fires. No, let's go the extra mile. I need something that firefighters could have mistaken for 'molten steel'. Even better, something that might partially account for the lingering hotspots under the rubble. How about... The reaction between aluminum and plaster (the important ingredient in which is calcium sulfate) is quite similar to that of thermite. Both of them ignite at relatively high temperatures (but attainable by the combustion of hydrocarbons like jet fuel), and both produce molten aluminum oxide, which is probably what the molten metal pouring from the window in that picture is. Aluminum would have been abundantly present in piping, or even better, in aluminum based paints DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE PLASTER. Once ignited, this reaction would be self sustaining and could burn for a very long time, producing huge quantities of aluminum oxide. So there you have it. The metal in that picture is not molten steel, but aluminum oxide. It did not come from thermite, but the aluminum-plaster reaction. Now I will go through and address each of your points. 1. As I already said, thermite does not produce rivers of molten steel. And unless this firefighter has an extensive knowledge of metallurgy, I don't trust him to know exactly what metal he was looking at. Again, the 'molten steel' was aluminum oxide. 2. Already addressed. 3. Bent steel is not the result of thermite. It is the result of 200,000 tons of building crushing down on it. 4. You are using the views of the third party to represent my views.

You indicated that: ""Your definitions are great, but they don't necessarily preclude any possibility that the two could be equal to each other, only that the two cannot be IDENTICAL to each other"". Well, first of all, there are not ""my"" definitions of rational and irrational numbers. This are the definitions that have been established for a long time, you can find them in any math book, and all mathematicians agree with them.

Using your logic, then 1.88 is equal to 2 as well, since I am pretty sure I wouldn't be able to identify the difference between a board that is 1.88 feet long and a board that is 2 feet long. You indicated that: ""Also, a full third is 0.333 repeating. But if you simply look at the number, 0.333 repeating SEEMS like it is *just* a little less than a third, because the numbers don't do it justice, in the same way that 1.999 repeating doesn't quite do justice to represent 2"" I indicated above that 0.333 repeating comes from the ratio of two integers, namely 1/3. If you calculate this ratio, and divide 1 by 3, you get 0.333 repeating. Therefore this shows clearly that 1/3 equals 0.333 repeating, and that 0.333 repeating is a rational number. You indicated that: ""If you multiply .333 repeating by 3 you get .999 repeating, which is equal to 1 because three thirds are a whole"" This is the origin of the problem, repeating numbers cannot be multiplied by integers since this operation is undefined in a similar way that 1/0 (one divided by zero, not the limit, just the number one divided by zero) is undefined. What I mean by ""repeating numbers cannot be multiplied by integers"" is that there is no mathematical definition or property that indicates that 3*0.333 repeating = 0.999 repeating, and you cannot get from one point to the other by using mathematical properties or definitions. However, you could show that 2*0.333 repeating equals 0.666 repeating by using the following mathematical properties: 2*0.333 repeating = 2*(1/3) This comes from the mathematical definition of dividing 1 by 3 = (2*1)/3 Associative property of multiplication = 2/3 Identity property of multiplication = 0.666 repeating This comes from the mathematical definition of dividing 2 by 3 The problem that arises with 0.999 repeating is that you cannot obtain it by dividing any two integers. Therefore you CANNOT show that 3*0.333 repeating = 0.999 repeating. You indicated that: ""How can you not add a repeating decimal??? Does this mean I can't add three thirds to get a whole? Aren't all numbers repeating decimals, with zeros on each end?"" As I indicated, you cannot add, multiply, substract, or divided, repeating numbers directly using math properties. There are properties that allow you to do this operations on integers or fractions, but not on repeating (or infinite numbers). And yes, all numbers can be written as repeating numbers, but the difference is that if you can write a repeating number as an integer or a fraction then you can perform addition, multiplication, substraction, or division on these forms of the number (NOTE: all numbers can be written as repeating numbers, however not all of them can be written with zeros at the end). In Tarzan's proof the flaw is in the fact that he multiplies 10 by A, then substracts A, and gets 18. What you should really get if you perform 10*A minus A, you will get 18.0000...(infinite zeros)...0001 As you can see, there will always be a one at the end of this infinite number (I know that for the human brain this is hard to grasp, but that is infinity).",0,kennard,"

definition of dividing 2 by 3  
  
The problem that arises with 0.999 repeating is that you cannot obtain it by dividing any two integers. Therefore you CANNOT show that 3*0.333 repeating = 0.999 repeating.  
  
You indicated that: ""How can you not add a repeating decimal??? Does this mean I can't add three thirds to get a whole? Aren't all numbers repeating decimals, with zeros on each end?""  
As I indicated, you cannot add, multiply, substract, or divided, repeating numbers directly using math properties. There are properties that allow you to do this operations on integers or fractions, but not on repeating (or infinite numbers). And yes, all numbers can be written as repeating numbers, but the difference is that if you can write a repeating number as an integer or a fraction then you can perform addition, multiplication, substraction, or division on these forms of the number (NOTE: all numbers can be written as repeating numbers, however not all of them can be written with zeros at the end).  
  
In Tarzan's proof the flaw is in the fact that he multiplies 10 by A, then substracts A, and gets 18. What you should really get if you perform 10*A minus A, you will get 18.0000...(infinite zeros)...0001  
As you can see, there will always be a one at the end of this infinite number (I know that for the human brain this is hard to grasp, but that is infinity).",Science,1,1.999-repeating-2/1/,146

Keep in mind, most women are just now finding out they are late on their period and by this time are taking pregnancy tests. The fifth week of human life is essential to what defines us as being alive because it is during this time the life is official, it has a heart beat. When we go to the hospital for serious reasons we are fitted with a heart beat monitor. This is vital for the doctors to know because it lets them know if you're on the verge of death. As humans, we judge life by the heart beat. A heart is formed at 18 days old and after 21 days the life in the womb has a heartbeat and can be seen on an ultrasound. -J.M. Tanner, G. R.

When we kill the human fetus, even at 21 days, we are taking a heartbeat and legally killing the life. At 21 days we can without a single notion of doubt say there is a life.

By the end of the third month, the hands and feet are not only formed but moving, acknowledging the notion that the baby is conscious of it's body. I have now laid out the foundation and formation of life in a simple form for the audience and must ask, how can life be a choice? Life is an organized preordained event as I have shown in the first 3 months alone.

Many heterosexual people are oppressed and are in reality homosexual in many countries such as ones in the Middle East and North Africa, where it is disencouraged or even banned by law. Sexuality can be compared to with religion. As soon as gay marriage is legalised, people will start coming out of their shells and being more open, possibly creating a norm. I will take your argument of there still being bisexual and heterosexual people existing, but after a period of time of legalisation I imagine they will be sparse. The idea for a time for 'breeding' is a good idea, however homosexual people may not actially want to have intercourse that would go against their sexuality. This shows how it could possibly become a norm and be harmful to reproduction.",People,1,Gay-Marriage-Should-Be-Legal-Wherever-Possible/1/,13004

NightofTheLivingCats may go ahead and start (  no acceptance  ), but s/he   must concede the last round   so that we each have an equal number of stories. Forfeits (except the last round) should count as an automatic loss.  Thank you so much! I'm really looking forward to this competition. Good luck!  There will be   no theme   for this debate.  Please   vote   on the   best overall story  . The only section that needs to be voted on is ""arguments,"" unless there is egregious misconduct or plagiarism (which would constitute a 7-point loss for that individual). No points taken off for grammar/spelling (although this may factor into your argument vote), sources, or conduct.",Games,0,DDOlympics-Storytelling-PRELIMS-1/1/,8640

My contentions were not attacked and are therefore sustained Con did not contest that there are worthwhile missions that moon base could accomplish. He did not contest that the costs of the project are reasonable in view of the objectives of combating global warming, providing long term energy to earth, performing valuable scientific research, and building an infrastructure for low cost space refueling. con does not dispute that the project is worth doing at the cost claimed, and that there is no better use of the money. Con's arguments are confined to technical feasibility. Con claims that a moon base cannot be sustained. I will answer each of his objections.

  Thanks to Con for an interesting and timely topic. Manned exploration of space is emerging as a campaign issue for the next presidential election.  My contentions were not attacked and are therefore sustained  Con did not contest that there are worthwhile missions that moon base could accomplish. He did not contest that the costs of the project are reasonable in view of the objectives of combating global warming, providing long term energy to earth, performing valuable scientific research, and building an infrastructure for low cost space refueling. con does not dispute that the project is worth doing at the cost claimed, and that there is no better use of the money.   Con's arguments are confined to technical feasibility. Con claims that a moon base cannot be sustained. I will answer each of his objections.

365,"Obviously this is a very large area to debate but I'll do my best to find a suitable start. I'm sure con won't mind if I start my debate in this round. The most obvious place to start I suppose is with the current recession we're in and the total collapse of the western economy. This will be my first premise. It creates a system in which hard working people are extremely likely to fail in the business world--my second premise. Capitalism is a relatively new thing. It has only existed since the industrial revolution began c.1800. This is my third premise. It causes war, destuction and crime--my fourth premise. I'll do my best to stick to these main points and in the order as above. P1) In September of 2008 the global markets crashed with, as we all know, disastrous consequences. But this was not an isolated event caused by a couple of gung-ho, irresponsible bankers who lost control temporarily. There have been dozens of recessions over the last twohundred years, arguably the most notorious in America being the wall street crash of the late 1920s and the recession in the 1980s being the most notorious in Britain. So in that sence the current world leaders ought to bare no blame. In the current system recessions are clearly inevitable. But, I'm sure you'll agree, a system that hosts a recession every few years isn't a system that works. Now; to cure a recession you need to get the banks trading again and to do this the banks need money. You must ask yourself: where will the money come from? The only two European countries that are barely keeping there heads above the water are France and Germany but even they can't afford to lend much more money. In south America you have countries that have never done well to sustain an economy, Mexico and Canada can't afford too loan money and the USA is getting closer to the condition that Greece, Ireland and Portugal are in every day. So want about Asia? Japan was driven back into recession by the nuclear disaster in Fukoshima south Korea has no money to give and china is already owed billions of dollars by the USA. African and middle eastern countries have no real economy as their best assets are already owned by the west. So unless the matins lend us a couple of trillion dollars these recessions are going to carry on happening every few decades. But let's ask ourselves where the money is. Money doesn't just disappear overnight. What's happened is the money is in the hands of a few billionaires who have continued to get richer despite the recession. You may argue that these enourmous anounts of money are necessary to create an incentive for production, that, for example, people would no longer develop technology if they werent treated as better, more elite people for it. But I ask you: would you decide to no longer work or invent things if you weren't paid extortionate amounts of money to do so? Would you go back to living in the medieval ages just because you couldn't have a swimming pool in your house? Our curiosity, imagination and injenuity extends back to times far before the invention of capitalism, back, even, to times before money was invented. No-one paid the cave men to paint. No-one paid for the invention of fire or the Cerne Abbis Giant in Cornwall or the neolithic tombs of the British Isles. or the numerous other feates of human capability throughout history and the world. Money is about greed, not motivation. P2)Despite the fact that I got a bit off course in my first premise I've lead myself neatly into my second premise. Not only would I say that capitalism is not an incentive for creativity - I would go as far as to say it stunts creativity. Why are there so few Bill Gates? Surely there are more people than that with the knowledge to create a business. Well, there are. The problem is people can't afford to create their own products, literature, art etc. This makes sense. For more billionaires to be created current billionaires would have to sacrifice money. Not something they'd be too keen on, is it? So, by definition not every-one can succeed. P3)I've already explained that capitalism is a new thing and isn't peoples incentive to invent and be productive, so I won't elaborate further on that point. P4)As I've already explained: not every-one can succeed in a capitalist society. So if, like at the moment, hundreds of thousands of people across the world find themselves unemployed--what are their options? They are offered social security; a small amount of money designed to merely keep people alive. But this simply isn't good enough for people who are capable of work and want to work. Some people think its their fault theyre unemployed and think that they must deal with the consequences and suffer. Others, though find themselves alienated from the system and gang culture increases. People who could be working end up vandalising and terrorising communities. The government plays this to their advantage by putting people into the prison system and hence the public think that crime is being fought. But the only long term solution to crime is to end unemployment--which capitalism can't do. My final premise is war. Capitalism has always started wars. Did Sadam Hussein posses weapons of mass destruction? No. He had oil. America needs oil--it's worth billions of dollars to them every year. But they couldnt stop at Iraq. They claimed that terrorism was Americas greatest threat. So they had to carry on fighting terrorism or face the consequences for starting a war under false pretensions. They invaded Afghanistan and carried on killing innocent civilians whilst getting the odd radical as-well. Now they want to invade Iran. And what are they accusing Iran of? The ability to create weapons of mass distruction of course. And who owns enough weapons of mass distraction to destroy the world several times over?

374,"I would like to clear this again: we are not debating whether cigarettes are healthy, but whether total ban is the solution to smoking problems. Rebuttals Okay. Given that you believe that total ban on cigarettes is the solution to smoking problems, but I tell it is not so. It would just create more problems as history had taught us especially during the Prohibition period in the United States where there was a ban on selling and consumption of alcohol. Like Volstead law (ban on alcohol), your proposal of total ban on cigarettes would just create disrespect for the law. As Abraham Lincoln said, ""Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and makes crimes out of things that are not crimes."" Another, it would just create black market and organized syndicates selling unregulated cigarettes. This is very dangerous to the people. Remember: where there is demand, there will be supply. It would also overburdened police, courts, and the penal system. Total ban on cigar, like in the Volstead law, would also harm people financially, emotionally, and morally.

  I would like to clear this again: we are not debating whether cigarettes are healthy, but whether total ban is the solution to smoking problems.     
  Rebuttals     
  Okay. Given that you believe that total ban on cigarettes is the solution to smoking problems, but I tell it is not so. It would just create more problems as history had taught us especially during the Prohibition period in the United States where there was a ban on selling and consumption of alcohol.     
  Like Volstead law (ban on alcohol), your proposal of total ban on cigarettes would just create disrespect for the law. As Abraham Lincoln said, “Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man’s appetite by legislation and makes crimes out of things that are not crimes.”     
  Another, it would just create black market and organized syndicates selling unregulated cigarettes. This is very dangerous to the people. Remember: where there is demand, there will be supply.     
  It would also overburdened police, courts, and the penal system.     
  Total ban on cigar, like in the Volstead law, would also harm people financially, emotionally, and morally.     
  Lastly, like ban on alcohol, total ban on cigarettes would prevent from seeking help those people are suffering from disease caused by smoking.

I'm doing this debate again in the hopes that my opponent's responses won't make me feel like I'm beating a baby seal to death. 1.) At the moment, Iowa enjoys a first in the nation caucus status. Should this status go away, we will have little to no impact on national policies. The result of the 2010 census will likely strip us from a congressional delegation of seven, to six further minimizing the ability of our state to influence national policy. 2.) As a State, Iowa has been consistently in the top ten for the quality of k-12 education. We're currently still in the top ten, in spite of the fact that it is not a priority of our spending. We are currently ranked 42nd in teacher pay. This supports an idea that Iowans, whether conservative of liberal, value a good education to the point that we invest resources aside from our tax dollars to maintain the high quality of education in our state. The disparity between the quality of the top ten and the bottom ten is so great that there is no way that it could be argued that citizens of the bottom ten states have the same values and priorities as Iowans, yet all ten of these states receive a larger congressional delegation. 3.) The Foreign policy which the United States pursues does not reflect the values, goals, or interests of the People of Iowa. We treat our neighbors better than this. Internationally, the United States has tarnished its name. Meanwhile, very few people think ill of the Iowa and Iowans. The Federal government is hurting our preventing us from having positive international relationships. 4.) Iowa does not need to spend a half trillion dollars on defense each year, not including the cost of the Iraq war. No one hates Iowa, and no one desires to attack Iowa. A majority of the federal government's military commitments do not reflect the interest of Iowa. 5.) More than a third of our federal tax revenue goes towards paying the interest on the national debt. These are tax dollars that ought to go towards improving infrastructure, specifically investing in non-fossil fuel energy industries in states like Iowa. There are other industries that could use the investment, and education could be steadily improved if we weren't using our tax dollars to make payments to China. The 9 trillion dollars wasn't spent in Iowa. 6.) In the 1960s we had the most efficient health care in the country. When Medicare was conceived, they applied statewide spending to a specific formula which would regulate the amount of funding increases received each year in each state. This formula has punished us for being efficient, in that now Iowa receives the lowest Medicare funds per capita in the country. Our nurses and medical professionals are unable to make as much as they could in bordering states that are benefiting today from being wasteful in the 1960s. 7.) The American economy is on the verge of collapse. The dollars is rapidly inflating in value due to irresponsible spending. In the state of Iowa, we have laws requiring that the state have a balanced budget. This value is not reflected by the federal government that has decided to treat the future of Iowa, and all of the other states as a blank check while they proceeded to mortgage as much of our future as possible. By leaving the Federal Government, we could establish our own currency, and be able to let our own values of fiscal conservatism carry their weight with our government.

This book is still looked upon as a great writing of Jewish History, so then CON must question everything written in this book if he does not believe parts of it why believe any of it.

All of which refer to Jesus in one form another. CON next questions the concept of why no one from Jesus writes of him, CON must have never read the Bible for that is all it talks about.

It is blantantly clear, and obvious, that if one action downgrades the quality of the life - the opposite maneuver will increase it. If we are not doing the damage anymore, than it will increase. The country may progress greater if never having it, causing the improvement of quality of life. * I do not wish to damage, or hurt the quality of life. My statements merely said I will not allow the FURTHER violation, which would hurt the people more than help. If we did this, they would be worse off than without the sanctions. * Sanctions cannot always be well-planned, and can cause unintended deaths. Thus, you cannot fully trust in no harm, and you may believe in possible harm. With that said, they cannot be applied. __ Opponent's Case: * I rebring to my opponent that they cannot always be used properly, and may be misused. Given that concept, you cannot truly trust them.

Response to response-d Cross Ex:  
  
* I thank you for clarifying your Value Premise.  
  
* I meant, through the clarification necessity on their criterion, what do they wish to accomplish in their case? What about Natural Rights? What are you trying to do with them?

Discussing my case:  
  
* My opponent is basically implying, in the first argument, that there is no win factor. Basically, doing ""something"" and doing ""nothing"" results in harm, not to mention deaths in the country.  
  
* It is not, nor never, will it be my job to uphold their values. It is blantantly clear, and obvious, that if one action downgrades the quality of the life - the opposite maneuver will increase it. If we are not doing the damage anymore, than it will increase. The country may progress greater if never having it, causing the improvement of quality of life.  
  
* I do not wish to damage, or hurt the quality of life. My statements merely said I will not allow the FURTHER violation, which would hurt the people more than help. If we did this, they would be worse off than without the sanctions.  
  
* Sanctions cannot always be well-planned, and can cause unintended deaths. Thus, you cannot fully trust in no harm, and you may believe in possible harm. With that said, they cannot be applied.

Opponent's Case:  
  
* I rebring to my opponent that they cannot always be used properly, and may be misused. Given that concept, you cannot truly trust them. Therefore, not ensuring Government Legitimacy.  
  
* For the first contention, my opponent gives examples on NK & Iran. However, there can be different results. As in the Iraq Sanctions and War, the Sanctions caused more deaths than war - thus, the death factor can be differential.

The affirmative speaker must present a position agreeing with the resolution. The negative debater must disagree with the resolution's statement. (1) In circumstances where a resolution presents two alternatives, (e.g., ""the sanctity of life should be valued above the quality of life') a negative side most commonly should argue the alternative to which the affirmative side has given second priority (i.e., 'the quality of life should be should be valued above the sanctity of life'). (2) A negative may choose a third option and argue both alternatives provided by the resolution. (3) A negative debater can also argue a ""critique"" against a resolution in its entirety. Because productive conflict, or 'clash,' is key to a Lincoln-Douglas debate, each debater should be able to make a positive case for their position and values, as opposed to a purely negative attack on those of their opponent. 2. Lincoln-Douglas is a fundamentally value-oriented (as opposed to policy-focused) debate. Judges must remember that debaters are not required to propose 'plans' for dealing with given situations. The role of debaters is to argue a moral position, and to use logic and ethical reasoning to do so. But any modern debating format, I will argue, should be designed to allow a maximum of flexibility in responding. This especially true when the topics are picked by just anyone.

418,"Thanks for the reply! First I would to like to begin with that I just copied the original threads title and stuck ""PART II"" at the end. But I do believe it's a clear statement. It claims that the Old Testament is a ""depressing paradigm"" which I will be refuting in this point. Furthermore, I do suggest that you read the entirety of my Round 1, for I say that I will argue from a Jewish Perspective and not a Christian Perspective. Meaning that Jesus has no authority, except as a Rabbi, in Judaic theological thought. But I would like to say that I am a Christian, and if you want an argument from a CHRISTIAN perspective, please feel free to challenge me. Now in regard to Old Testament morality being ""outdated."" That is definitely untrue. I will refer as my authority an article called ""Progress or Return: Crisis of Modernity"" by Leo Strauss, who will be my support throughout this debate. As humanity enters deeper into the new millennium, man is confronted by more and more ideological, social, and ethical struggles. What crisis is Western civilization confronting? Modernity has encrypted us with this notion of progression; that modern man should look towards the future and not towards the past. The past, as modern man is concerned, is inferior and irrelevant to our day and age. Progress proclaims that life is simply good. Progress, as such, is change in the direction of the end for the perfection of the understanding. But the concept of progress is slowly being replaced with the idea of ""change."" People are no longer certain that they are moving in the right direction; no longer certain that there is a guaranteed goodness in understanding.

Thanks for the reply!  
First I would to like to begin with that I just copied the original threads title and stuck ""PART II"" at the end. But I do believe it's a clear statement. It claims that the Old Testament is a ""depressing paradigm"" which I will be refuting in this point.  
  
Furthermore, I do suggest that you read the entirety of my Round 1, for I say that I will argue from a Jewish Perspective and not a Christian Perspective. Meaning that Jesus has no authority, except as a Rabbi, in Judaic theological thought.  
  
But I would like to say that I am a Christian, and if you want an argument from a CHRISTIAN perspective, please feel free to challenge me.  
  
Now in regard to Old Testament morality being ""outdated."" That is definitely untrue. I will refer as my authority an article called  
""Progress or Return: Crisis of Modernity"" by Leo Strauss, who will be my support throughout this debate.  
  
As humanity enters deeper into the new millennium, man is confronted by more and more ideological, social, and ethical struggles. What crisis is Western civilization confronting? Modernity has encrypted us with this notion of progression; that modern man should look towards the future and not towards the past. The past, as modern man is concerned, is inferior and irrelevant to our day and age.  
Progress proclaims that life is simply good. Progress, as such, is change in the direction of the end for the perfection of the understanding.  
But the concept of progress is slowly being replaced with the idea of ""change."" People are no longer certain that they are moving in the right direction; no longer certain that there is a guaranteed goodness in understanding. In a sense, the contemporary crisis of Western civilization is paradigmatic with the climactic crisis of the idea of progress.

It has nothing to do with animosity towards you or the subject. < > Your argument that the higher numbers bears no weight on the general election is false. During the 2006 midterm election, voter turnout was much higher for Democrats than Republicans with an altogether 40% increase. According to the Associated Press Nov. 8, 2006 - ""WASHINGTON - Voter turnout was more than 40 percent this year, slightly higher than in the last midterm election, according to the non partisan Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University. A preliminary analysis showed turnout down in some states and up in others -- notably up in Virginia, where it appeared a higher number voted than in any midterm in the state's history, said Curtis Gans, director of the center. It also was a big turnout success for Democrats. They drew more voters than Republicans for the first time in a midterm election since 1990, Gans said Wednesday."" According to this report the result led to a Democratic victory in the House and Senate. The pendulum is swinging towards the Democrats and it has not been demonstrated that it has stopped swinging. But if this is not enough to convince you. You can also turn to fund raising differences. Democrats are outnumbering Republicans in fund raising efforts. Leslie Wayne of the New York Times Politics Blog, reported that: ""...in the first three quarters of 2007, the top three Democratic presidential candidates raised $200 million and had $98 million left, while the top four Republican candidates raised $154 million and had $35 million left. And every month this year, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised more than the National Republican Senatorial Committee --$49.3 million raised for Democratic Senate efforts as of Nov. 30 (with $23.4 million on hand), compared with $28.7 million for Republican Senate campaigns ($10.4 million on hand). The Republicans are also at a disadvantage on the House side, with $60.8 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($30.7 million cash left) compared with $43.4 million for its Republican counterpart ($2.3 million on hand.)"" < > There are always political divides between candidates in both parties during the primaries, and they are always bitter when two or more candidates are competing for front runner status. This is not an indication of weakness but of strength. Once a decision is made on who the Democrats will choose as their candidate, the party will be in full support of that candidate despite current differences. All the candidates have respect for each other as they have stated consistently during past debates. The differences between them are minor. Divisions between the camps is a matter of perception. If you want to compare the differences then make a list do a comparison. Each camp will have a fair amount of agreements and disagreements. How the candidates communicate those differences, is what you are responding to. If a candidate shows more anger then you may probably interpret it as bitter and divisive. I believe that the Republicans and Democrats have been relatively civil in their candor. There has been no ""swift-boating"" as a way of scoring political points yet. < > Your argument here is a weak one. What are the Republicans changing from? A continuation of the Iraq war to a continuation of the Iraq war? A support of ""the surge"" to a support of the ""surge?"" A support of the Bush tax cuts to a support of the Bush tax cuts?"" This doesn't seem like change to me. < As voters become increasingly pleased with the situation in Iraq, the Republican party looks better and better. This is true of the economy as well. There has been a lot of recession talk lately, but just today, Bernanke issued a statement that said the economy will begin to rise during the summer and fall. We know this is probable because Washington just introduced an economic stimulus plan that will reduce the effective of the housing bubble and return growth to the economy. As the issues look better and better, Republicans follow suit.>> In a short sighted sense, the surge has reduced attacks in Baghdad only recently. However, 2007 has been the deadliest year in Iraq since the war started and it remains to be seen if the ""surge"" can sustain that success. There is every reason to believe that violence can increase at anytime for any reason. In fact, violence in Iraq has always had a tendency to increase during the summer season.

Your argument that the higher numbers bears no weight on the general election is false. During the 2006 midterm election, voter turnout was much higher for Democrats than Republicans with an altogether 40% increase. According to the Associated Press Nov. 8, 2006 -  
  
""WASHINGTON - Voter turnout was more than 40 percent this year, slightly higher than in the last midterm election, according to the non partisan Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University.  
A preliminary analysis showed turnout down in some states and up in others — notably up in Virginia, where it appeared a higher number voted than in any midterm in the state's history, said Curtis Gans, director of the center.  
It also was a big turnout success for Democrats. They drew more voters than Republicans for the first time in a midterm election since 1990, Gans said Wednesday.""  
  
According to this report the result led to a Democratic victory in the House and Senate. The pendulum is swinging towards the Democrats and it has not been demonstrated that it has stopped swinging. But if this is not enough to convince you. You can also turn to fund raising differences. Democrats are outnumbering Republicans in fund raising efforts. Leslie Wayne of the New York Times Politics Blog, reported that:  
  
""...in the first three quarters of 2007, the top three Democratic presidential candidates raised $200 million and had $98 million left, while the top four Republican candidates raised $154 million and had $35 million left. And every month this year, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised more than the National Republican Senatorial Committee —$49.3 million raised for Democratic Senate efforts as of Nov. 30 (with $23.4 million on hand), compared with $28.7 million for Republican Senate campaigns ($10.4 million on hand). The Republicans are also at a disadvantage on the House side, with $60.8 million raised by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ($30.7 million cash left) compared with $43.4 million for its Republican counterpart ($2.3 million on hand.)""  
  
<  >  
  
There are always political divides between candidates in both parties during the primaries, and they are always bitter when two or more candidates are competing for front runner status. This is not an indication of weakness but of strength. Once a decision is made on who the Democrats will choose as their candidate, the party will be in full support of that candidate despite current differences. All the candidates have respect for each other as they have stated consistently during past debates. The differences between them are minor. Divisions between the camps is a matter of perception. If you want to compare the differences then make a list do a comparison. Each camp will have a fair amount of agreements and disagreements. How the candidates communicate those differences, is what you are responding to. If a candidate shows more anger then you may probably interpret it as bitter and divisive. I believe that the Republicans and Democrats have been relatively civil in their candor. There has been no ""swift-boating"" as a way of scoring political points yet.  
  
<  >  
  
Your argument here is a weak one. What are the Republicans changing from? A continuation of the Iraq war to a continuation of the Iraq war? A support of ""the surge"" to a support of the ""surge?"" A support of the Bush tax cuts to a support of the Bush tax cuts?"" This doesn't seem like change to me.  
  
<  
As voters become increasingly pleased with the situation in Iraq, the Republican party looks better and better. This is true of the economy as well. There has been a lot of recession talk lately, but just today, Bernanke issued a statement that said the economy will begin to rise during the summer and fall. We know this is probable because Washington just introduced an economic stimulus plan that will reduce the effective of the housing bubble and return growth to the economy.  
As the issues look better and better, Republicans follow suit.>>  
  
In a short sighted sense, the surge has reduced attacks in Baghdad only recently. However, 2007 has been the deadliest year in Iraq since the war started and it remains to be seen if the ""surge"" can sustain that success. There is every reason to believe that violence can increase at anytime for any reason. In fact, violence in Iraq has always had a tendency to increase during the summer season. Either way, the ""surge"" strategy is a not stable one. This is a gamble that can easily backfire on the Republicans if there is a sudden increase in violence.

429,"So, there has been a debate going on for a very long time. It is Computers vs. Consoles. There has been a long dispute over which is better. When the first Xbox came out, i was awed by the technology. Being able to play games in 3-dimensions was awesome. But what i didn't know was that there was one so-called ""console"" beforehand. It was called the computer! If I took everything i know about both consoles (xbox 360 specifically) and computers, computers would totally dominate the consoles. Before, I was in favour of the 360. But when the PC came out, i realized i was living on a lie. There is a reasonable explanation and clear arguement why PCs are better than consoles. And that is what i will explain to you... First of all, most desktops (And even certain laptops) have more processing power. They can, very simply put, run better on games, rather than consoles. Most games, such as the COD franchise, have run smoothly on consoles and PCs at a decent FPS (60-120 on both). But consoles faced a bigger challenge when they got hand-to-hand on larger games, such as GTA 4, or Battlefield. They couldn't really run it with very high, and detailed graphics. So, they made something called optimization, which is considered as ""putting a game's graphics down so it runs better and faster."" But because of more advanced technology in computers, we don't need to optimize, but run on a decent FPS with VERY high graphics. My second and last reason for this round is that computers are more easier to play on. Some people are much more reliable on a controller, i get that... but some people aren't. They rather play on something that seems to be complex, but much simpler than a joystick... a KEYBOARD. Almost anyone can learn and play on a keyboard and mouse. It feels so much... smoother. Compare games like any first-person shooter. I don't understand how people can aim with a wiggly stick. And that comes from a person who has played those sort of games on a console. (yes, even i'm bad...) With a mouse, you are more accurate and more responsive with your movements. Clean-cut accuracy. So, that was my arguement. Disagree with me?

So arguments that evolution took place to advance living organisms on Earth to the point of humanity as it exists today is irrelevant. This is not an argument on Genesis or scripture. But what we call ""Natural"" selection, is in truth anything but ""Natural"". Let me explain first why this is possible, addressing my opponent's ""If this were true, then where did this intelligence creating intelligence come from?"" That is on its face ridiculous. We humans are intelligent. During the last thousand years, we have caused tremendous changes in the eco-system, and more importantly, we have brought tremendous changes in the characteristics of animals. Through selective husbandry, we have bred animals for speed, strength, weight, and intelligence. If we accept opponent's arguments, then it is impossible for us to have created/bred intelligence in other organisms through intelligent and organized design, because then ""where did that one come from?"" Now that being said, I first have to show of course that it is possible for our ""evolution"" to have taken place according to an intelligent design. Let me clarify, when I say ""God"" I do not mean the God of the bible or Koran or any specific holy text of any specific religion. I simply mean an entity(ies) tremendously superior to ourselves who have powers beyond our ability to comprehend. Just as the bacteria we manipulate cannot grasp the tools and devices through which we operate, if God operates on the evolutionary path of humanity and interferes to produce intelligent humans, why is it inconceivable we would not be able to detect the means by which they take action? That they operate through evolution is not inconsistent with the fact that they operate. Of course the third part, the crux of my argument is to show that not only is it possible, it is likely that we have experienced intervention from God, resulting in the creation of humanity as it is today. Here I address first the statement ""It isn't that good. It isn't that robust."" Creation is a difficult task and we have no reason to believe that God would waste time making us perfect. That we are not perfect is not relevant. The genetic manipulations we carry out are not perfect either, but that does not mean we did not interfere in the development of bacteria. And once again, from the perspective of bacteria, we are Gods. Multicellular life has existed on Earth for about 1 billion years. This indicates there is a high probability of intelligent design in our creation. First, ""However, there is also a gradual trend as far as intelligent life goes. It is true that human-style intelligence seems rare, but intelligence in organisms seems to be quite common and trends toward the more intelligent over the less intelligent."" There is no reason for evolution to proceed towards greater intelligence. Intelligence is just one of thousands of characteristics that promote survival and reproduction. Chimpanzees, which are highly intelligent, are no more successful than antelopes or lions or crocodiles. Dolphins, which are highly intelligent, are no more successful than sharks, or whales, or tuna. If intelligence is not particularly key to survival and reproduction, the fact that there is an evolutionary trend towards intelligence, which only started recently in the last several million years, is evidence that something took place to bring about this transformation. Evolution is DIVERGENT. The fact that crows, dolphins, and humans began developing intelligence at the same time even though they exist in environments that are completely unrelated is strong evidence of an outside force. Secondly, operating on the postulate of continuous time, it is impossible for intelligence and humanity to have developed at the point it did about 3 million years ago. In fact, at any point in development, the probability of random development at that point is 0.

This is certainly true for a human understanding, and a human brain... But shouldn't an omnipotent being always be able to do, always 'can' and never 'can't'? To suggest that something is impossible to conceptualise is to suggest that for an omnipotent being, there is something not possible. Regardless of the idea that this makes no logical sense to us, total power has to overcome logic by brute force, or it wouldn't be total. One alternative is that an omnipotent being can make square triangles and yellow a scent, but he (or she, of course) chooses not to. If they had chosen to, we wouldn't question it, or consider it at all unusual. But this argument leads us to the thorny issue of how an omnipotent being makes choices, and the crux of my argument. If an omnipotent being is choosing to not break the rules of logic, even though they can (which is, I believe, the only explanation that leaves the concept of omnipotence intact) then they're an active, choosing, rational being. Essentially, they change. They contain within themselves the possibility for all changes and all actions, and in order to preserve this infinite potential, they can only make temporary choices - such as 'today squares and triangles are different, but somehow with my infinite power, I may make them the same tomorrow.' Otherwise, if they made an irreversible change, that would be equal to them not have the power to change something. This rationally allows the concept of omnipotence, and allows statements 1 and 2.

But it implies, or rather, shows that an omnipotent being would have to exist within time. Otherwise, how could it use it's power in some things (such as making, say, the Universe or a cup of tea) but not in others - the very fact that an omnipotent being has the power and the potential to do everything shows that it has future possible actions it could take. And all things that have a future must therefore be within time. This leads you to the infinite difficulties of 'what has a beginning must have began', or the problem that something must have created infinite power. And, more significantly, the issue that omnipotence can't exist in the physical world, but also can't exist out of it. To sum up this argument, an omnipotent being must be able to create anything he wishes even if logically impossible. However, this would require him to make time-involved choices that he could only make if he existed within the frame of time. That would make him a physical concept, but omnipotence can't be physical because the physical world is never infinite or total. This is what I would call a true paradox.

And all things that have a future must therefore be within time. This leads you to the infinite difficulties of 'what has a beginning must have began', or the problem that something must have created infinite power. And, more significantly, the issue that omnipotence can't exist in the physical world, but also can't exist out of it.  
  
To sum up this argument, an omnipotent being must be able to create anything he wishes even if logically impossible. However, this would require him to make time-involved choices that he could only make if he existed within the frame of time. That would make him a physical concept, but omnipotence can't be physical because the physical world is never infinite or total. This is what I would call a true paradox.

What are we falling behind on? I am going to put it this way, Say you leader of a group of important people and one of these people falls behind and is not able to reap any kind of benefit and you have the know how to get that person to get a better life. Shouldn't it be the leaders job and responsibility to help the person into gaining those benefits of life? Now lets put that with the U.S. We are the leading country of the world militarily, as the leader it is our responsibility to help those who don't have their full potential out. Just as the leader of the people should help if able, the U.S. should help as the leader. Other wise we forfeit our role as leader because we are unable to help others. Ok lets go to spending the money on our own country: The U.S. Government has raised the debt threshold time and time again so that we can borrow money from other countries. If you want the money to be spent elsewhere we take it from the job that America was meant for and get our leadership aka the Government to stop borrowing money and focus and helping our economy for the better. Ok now one of my favorite subjects to argue about: Health care: What is health care, well it is a privilege. No health care is not a right. How have we fallen behind in health care? This can be answered very simply by the universal health care bill. What does this do? I caused the Government to spend money on the people who can't spare a dime. Because the American people can't pay for this what do they do? They borrow money from other countries. Again this proves my point about wasting our money. Now you may think, but what about the poor people who can't pay for it. Did you know that most of the people who get on a government paid program like to stay there because it means no work for them. Lets face it most people are lazy. Don;t get me wrong the people working and trying to get out of poverty are going to get out soon enough. others though will stay and suck up our taxes. You say our money is wasted on the military, look to America and see what is truly causing this. On to your point about fixing ourselves and that we can't fix others: My previous points explain the way to fix ourselves not phasing out the military. The military should stay strong as it always has. tapering with it causes an unbalance in the global affairs. Look to America fix what it here. I have never disagreed with helping other, but if these people we are trying to help in America are taking the money and not tying to help themselves. Why I ask are we supposed to continue giving then more money through more bills and now health care. And now on the education: You have failed to explain how this is failing so I will simply say it is not.

Nowhere in this resolution does it suggest that we would pay other people, that we would pay people born before the resolution payments as well. However, PRO keeps hitting on this fact for some reason. PRO has changed the resolution completely, which I must say, is extremely unfair.

Atheists consist of much faith more so than those who believe in God. Just like those who believe in God, Atheists believe that nature created the universe and not God. In other words nature created it's self for no reason. There is no reason in why nature created the universe. More so than that, nature, just like the bees make honey from pollon and cows make milk from nutrients, nothing in nature has given us any proof of nature creating it's own self. There is always proof of something else which created apart of nature. It says in Psalm 14:1 ""Fools say to them self 'There is no God.'"" Here is something for the atheists who believe there is no God, ""Show me a message that does not come from a mind."" Now DNA is a code, DNA is a language like the English language is a code. It is a code because we all agree with each other that, say the word 'joy' means glad within or for you people out there like JCMT, the word 'with' means, I am near you in spirit mind or physically. So you have patterns and information. A pattern is something that consists of random actions, like a snow flake is a pattern. To have snow you need water, cold air, gavity, wind, time = snow flake. All those things, like water, cold air, gravity, wind and time have no design but they also have no mind. We could get into another argument about God actually doing all this, because God is God. However we won't go there. Music for an example was written and had a design, you can make copies of music on paper or as sound, but it can always be repeated. You could print music from your computer, you could write it or speak it over the phone For example, ""low G low C high C"" I am no music master but you get the idea. Anyway the information given is still the same. Can you now see a difference from a pattern to information? I hope so. DNA always has 4 letters just like a calculator has 10 number, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. To produce any number you need those 10 numbers there which I listed. Like DNA has the letters Gg,Cc,Aa and Tt. To produce and creature of any kind you need this code. Just like all the numbers which I have listed, they were thought up. 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs the point is that I can not add a number or just invent a new numder because it's already got a code just like the English language. DNA is information, a language, well from who? There are 5 possible solutions to find out where DNA came from. 1, Designed by aliens? Well no because aliens would already have DNA and that get us nowhere. 2, Designed by human? No again, because we consisted of DNA before anyone thought of DNA. Time travel? No because that human who is traveling in time has DNA already. 3, A product of chance? No again, this would then, if DNA was a product of chance destroy all science and block all investigation. For example, if a leaf fell from a tree, you wouldn't say that was by chance, but say gravity caused the leaf to fall. So this solution gets us nowhere. 4, A new unknown law of physics? If DNA is a unknown law of physics then why does DNA have 4 letters and not 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 or any other number? It has 4 letters. Since no one has discovered a law of physics that created information or no one has found some information which has not been from some intelligence. This solution get us nowhere once again. 5, God created and designed DNA. Because if you assume DNA was desgined then you can understand that if there is something you do not understand, there must be a good reason for it in the first place. So Kleptin give me a message or some information that did not ultamitly come from an intelligence, otherwise God exists and DNA proves God exists.

True, you have made your points- but all of your points have been throughly refuted by me. It's your job to give them the information, and it's your job to convince them of the conclusion you wish to support- not theirs. Regardless of whether or not people would accept it I suggest it should be implemented. You are again using the argument from popularity fallacy. Just because people support something doesn't mean it's good, and just because people don't support something doesn't mean that it is bad.  
  
You start to use circular reasoning later on, saying that Since I am the minority I am incorrect, therefore you are correct- when the subject is on democracy or 'majority rule' itself, It becomes illogically circular.

Are you trying to run away from your own Bible, which by the way, endorses polygamy in several different places? I am not deflecting the topic. My opponent stated in his opening remarks that he will argue that marriage is one-man-one-woman and that this is based on Christian principles. I simply pointed out that Christian principles require us to endorse polygamy. So to uphold the resolution, my opponent must argue for Biblical marriage which is polygamy. Has he argued for it? Of course not. ""My opponent also manipulatively twisted my words in saying that my argument was justified based on the assertion that ""most people were christian"" - my argument was that American Society and culture came into existence based off of Christian Tradition and culture, and to suddenly neglect one element of that culture and retain all of the others is fallacious!"" This argument has two parts, and I will address both. First, Pro states that I have manipulated his argument. I have done no such thing, and Pro has in fact manipulated my own words. Pro claimed that, whether people know it or not -- and it's interested that he conceded that the U.S. may not be ""explicitly"" Christian, which means it is implicitly Christian (which doesn't even make any sense) -- they have been influenced by Christian values, so therefore we should impose Christian values because doing so would be redefining marriage. First, Biblical marriage is NOT one-man-one-woman, it's polygamy. So if the Bible is our standard for defining marriage -- it's not, because marriage is not ipso facto religious, but let's pretend for a moment that it is -- then we've already changed the definition of marriage because polygamy isn't legal. Second -- and this is the second part of Pro's argument which I will also debunk -- Pro's argument hinges on the notion that people and culture resulted from Christianity. But there is NO basis for this whatsoever. She provided us no sourcing of this whatsoever save for an ABC piece stating that most Americans are Christians and a biased faith website with a quote from Dinesh D'Souza -- who was just charged with violating campaign finance laws, by the way -- ASSERTING that it is. But there is NO evidence for this claim whatsoever. Nevertheless, Pro's argument is this: P1: American is a Christian Nation because Christianity is the basis for morality. P2: Christianity states that marriage is one-man-one-woman. C: Therefore, marriage should be one-man-one-woman. I have already refuted both P1 and P2 so the resolution falls. Pro goes on to conecede that the United States was not founded on Christian principle, but that it thrived under Christian influence, and that by following Christian ideasl, it has become the ""center of freedom and liberty."" How? In what way? Where is the link or the causation? I proved that this nation does not follow Christian principles because Church and governed were designed to be secular. In what way has the country followed Christian principles? Let's even take an example: Jesus said ""turn the other cheek"" rather than fight back. Yet we have the largest military in the world. How is that a Christian principle? My opponent then disingenously makes a reductio ad absurdum to North Korea, forgetting that there is even a such thing as a secular religion: it's called a cult of personality. But even if this weren't the case, there is NO coherent link made here between secularism and horror. This is merely a bare-assertion fallacy and a non sequitur. He then claims that secularists don't get to claim the nation ""as their work."" But I never stated that we do. My OPPONENT wants to claims it as the work of Christians, but it surely was not. It was founded as a secular nation, admittedly by some people who were religious, some more than others, and some of whom were not religious.

Often people point out these literary devices as making the Bible contradictory or unscientific. But everyone uses figures of speech in everyday language and writing. If its summer we might say we are 'roasting,' though not literally. In this round I will show how each of these passages are nothing more that the Hebrew literary method. But first, I would like to let my opponent know that KJV is probably not the optimal version of the Bible for scholarly study or a debate that hinges on the translation. I will use New American Standard Bible for my arguments. 1. Shape of the Earth Isaiah 40:22 It is He who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers, who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in. The 'circle of the earth' could mean one of two things, the earth is spherical or the earth is flat and circular. Given that there is a different word for 'sphere' I would say it means flat and circular. This could be reflective off the culture and science of the time, or this statement could be nothing more than a metaphorical device. Notice that every description other in this passage is metaphorical. Does God sit above the circle of the earth? Do humans look like grasshoppers? Did God stretch the heavens out like taffy? Are they like a tent? Etc. These are all metaphors and simile. Isaiah is one of the most symbolic books of the Bible; it is apparent Isaiah was not trying to be a geologist. The second passage is similar, after all, Jesus constantly speaks in parables and hyperbole. And Jesus naturally would have relayed this event to Matthew and His other disciples. Even if the earth was flat, one could not see all its kingdoms from a mountain, and such a tall mountain doesn't even exist. This is not literal then. Naturally, Jesus would have explained the story in a manner the disciples could comprehend. It was as if He was looking from a very tall mountain onto all the earth. I'm sure that is what the disciples got out of it, and to say that this is another metaphorical device would certainly make sense. There were non-literal statements in other verses of the same story. 2. Do you answer a fool? This is one of my favorite proverbs mainly because of the clever play on words used here. Answer not a fool according to his folly , means don't let a fool bring you down to their level in an argument. The next verse is not contradictory but complimentary. For a better understanding of its literal translation let's look in the NASB version: Proverbs 26:4-5 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will also be like him. Answer a fool as his folly deserves , that he not be wise in his own eyes. This is not telling us to avoid the remarks of a fool, just not according to his own foolishness. Some arguments are bad, therefore we shouldn't go along with the bad argument getting all worked up about nonsense. Often, all the fool wants is to get you frustrated and make you look like an idiot. This applies to debating. Off the top of my head I can remember a debate where I completely failed at this. 3. Contradictions with science and history Jesus attempts to teach biology? First of all, the point of the parable is obviously not meant to teach these people biology. He's simply exaggerating elements to strengthen the allegorical significance of the parable. It's hyperbole. If my opponent would like me to give all the reasons He chose a mustard tree, I can go over them or we may move on. Pro claims he has ' tons of more arguments.' However, I would be surprised if he had more than 2,000, so I will suggest that he makes sure they are not just arguments regarding literary devices.

My opponent, on the other hand, is an enemy of the PFUs. He has gone to war on them on a number of occasions. Rebuttals 1. They will fall to their doom This is very unrealistic because, like I said, unicorns are powerful immortal beings with magical powers. Of course they will survive and thrive on the rainbows! Unicorns have a magical horn, which they can use to make the rainbows also magical. 2. They will be video recorded and gone viral within seconds This is actually a good thing, because unicorns enjoy fame. They will thank the man releasing the video and shower him with gifts. There are many good things about being famous. I even would like to become famous myself. 3. Evil PFUs Will die before falling to their doom Rainbows are actually the unicorn's most favorite thing ever. PFUs absolutely love rainbows. They even would dance on rainbows voluntarily. Chuck Norris' Rainbow Round-House Kick is very friendly and PFUs love rainbows. The PFUs are not evil; they are kind creatures, and they are also very smart. How dare you call them stupid! PFUs are highly intelligent. 4. Spongebob Will Not Exist Anymore in Bikini Bottom This is actually a good thing, because Spongebob is a horribly annoying little creature. He deserves to die.

  Why it is moral to force PFU to dance on rainbows  1. Pink fluffy unicorns   like   dancing on rainbows.   Unicorns are magical creatures (1) who can obviously survive dancing on rainbows and even enjoy the dancing. They will happily dance around and have a great time. Sometimes they will even gather more PFUs so that they can dance around and be very happy.  2. Pink fluffy unicorns will become world famous  PFUs will become viral and famous. Interviewers will want to interview the PFUs to find out more about them. In fact, PFUs will become very rich and wealthy! Most unicorns enjoy fame and fortune, so they will have a great time being famous. People all over the world will gather fan clubs and new friends and be sponsored all over the universe!

However, it behoves me to illustrate with all due respect, that, generally speaking, married women with children get a raw deal compared to spinsters. You see, in the beginning, Mother Nature explained to humanity that the roles of the two sexes would be broadly organised as follows: Men would get the best paid jobs and every day after work they would get to go to the pub, have a few beers with their pals, boast about their new mid-engined V10 twin-turbo Italian sports car, chat up the barmaid, play the fruit machine and then go home for his evening meal. After that he would watch sport on TV and drink some more beer until it was time to go to bed. At the weekends he would have a hobby, something exciting like power-boating or motor-racing or flying light aircraft - about which pastimes there would be loads of magazines in the newsagents. Meanwhile, women would get the low paid jobs and after work, pick up the kids from school, go and do the shopping and then go home, clean the house up and prepare the evening meal. After that she would clear away the dishes, put the kids to bed and do some sewing until it was time to go to sleep. At the weekends she would do more shopping, more housework, more sewing and ferry the kids from pillar to post in her 4-cylinder, seven-seat Korean-built MPV.

How come the boys get to do all the fun stuff while we do all the work? Mother Nature: Okay, I see your point.

479,"Ethnic Spillovers- Ethnic conflict has plagued inner Africa for years leading to lack of cooperation and unified nations. Research it on your own if you are confused. Food and Water- These two go hand and hand as far as the aid in Africa is concerned. You need both in order to ensure people are healthy and taken care of. Though this project focuses on water it isn't the ""God savior"" of the region as you claim it will be. Africa and America help both- No. Like I previously mentioned I am not willing to spend the money on a project with low success. You talk about the foreign aid being set aside already. This is true but it is always subject to change as well as you are not obligated to spend it all on if you don't have too. It is possible to take of both but it is expensive to do this. Why are we obligated to do this? They are their own until they can prove to us that there is consistent peace and cooperation among these nations. Until then, hope that the UN will not be corrupt enough to take money that could go towards this project. Water seized by tyrants- I think I already cited evidence of this in Somalia and Rwanda. If you still do not understand research General Adied's role in Somalia and watch the movie ""sometime in April"" which depicts the horrific events of Rwanda. People starving and dehydrated beyond recognition as the US intervened while others watched. Soldiers where killed and we could do nothing to prevent a civil war from breaking out. The tyrants run the governments, and whatever (water, food, medical supplies) runs through their country. America helps Africa- We already send millions in AIDs awareness, Red cross medical treatment, dental and hygiene help, and food/water to Africa. The problem is that most of these good intentions are intercepted by the African governments and is not distributed properly to the people. This goes back to the infrastructure specifically A UNIVERSAL, CONTINENT WIDE ROAD SYSTEM THAT UNITES ALL THE COUNTRIES preventing the mission to be achieved. Hope that clears up what I am saying about the problems that prevent food and water from reaching these people, cited by my source earlier. Other Countries- If the UN isn't about to jump onto this idea, America should especially not try to do this. If a coalition of countries separate from the UN want to pursue this, then I am in support. But, America going alone is what I am against. These problems you claim are global issues, so that is the reason we have the crappy UN to do this. We send enough money and support to the UN so they can take care of these type of specific things. So do not say that America is the only one that can do this because is just foolish. Evidence- Obviously you have done extensive research on this topic. As far as the claim that I can not use first or second hand accounts in my argument is stupid. How else can I get knowledge of somewhere I have never been without being subject to false statements by the media etc. It is by talking to those who have been there. Challenge my integrity if you will but I will state what I believe to be true, facts cited or not. Furthermore, I do not need research my points because one, I do no have time and two, I do not care enough. This is a debate where I can go on my extensive knowledge of the matter and those voting will respect my points because of my honestly and delivery. So with that said I guess you win because of the fact that you have nice links and other such info supporting your arguments.

Ethnic Spillovers- Ethnic conflict has plagued inner Africa for years leading to lack of cooperation and unified nations. Research it on your own if you are confused.  
  
Food and Water- These two go hand and hand as far as the aid in Africa is concerned. You need both in order to ensure people are healthy and taken care of. Though this project focuses on water it isn't the ""God savior"" of the region as you claim it will be.  
  
Africa and America help both- No. Like I previously mentioned I am not willing to spend the money on a project with low success. You talk about the foreign aid being set aside already. This is true but it is always subject to change as well as you are not obligated to spend it all on if you don't have too. It is possible to take of both but it is expensive to do this. Why are we obligated to do this? They are their own until they can prove to us that there is consistent peace and cooperation among these nations. Until then, hope that the UN will not be corrupt enough to take money that could go towards this project.  
  
Water seized by tyrants- I think I already cited evidence of this in Somalia and Rwanda. If you still do not understand research General Adied's role in Somalia and watch the movie ""sometime in April"" which depicts the horrific events of Rwanda. People starving and dehydrated beyond recognition as the US intervened while others watched. Soldiers where killed and we could do nothing to prevent a civil war from breaking out. The tyrants run the governments, and whatever (water, food, medical supplies) runs through their country.  
  
America helps Africa- We already send millions in AIDs awareness, Red cross medical treatment, dental and hygiene help, and food/water to Africa. The problem is that most of these good intentions are intercepted by the African governments and is not distributed properly to the people. This goes back to the infrastructure specifically A UNIVERSAL, CONTINENT WIDE ROAD SYSTEM THAT UNITES ALL THE COUNTRIES preventing the mission to be achieved. Hope that clears up what I am saying about the problems that prevent food and water from reaching these people, cited by my source earlier.  
  
Other Countries- If the UN isn't about to jump onto this idea, America should especially not try to do this. If a coalition of countries separate from the UN want to pursue this, then I am in support. But, America going alone is what I am against. These problems you claim are global issues, so that is the reason we have the crappy UN to do this. We send enough money and support to the UN so they can take care of these type of specific things. So do not say that America is the only one that can do this because is just foolish.  
  
Evidence- Obviously you have done extensive research on this topic. As far as the claim that I can not use first or second hand accounts in my argument is stupid. How else can I get knowledge of somewhere I have never been without being subject to false statements by the media etc. It is by talking to those who have been there. Challenge my integrity if you will but I will state what I believe to be true, facts cited or not. Furthermore, I do not need research my points because one, I do no have time and two, I do not care enough. This is a debate where I can go on my extensive knowledge of the matter and those voting will respect my points because of my honestly and delivery. So with that said I guess you win because of the fact that you have nice links and other such info supporting your arguments.

They are simply mistaken in their conclusion about where the sound came from. (And neither conclusion would make them ALL right or ALL wrong - some would be correct either way...)"" ---- I really don't think this is a plausible explanation at all. Considering bullets were only supposed to have come from one source (the book depository), it's very compelling to note that almost as many people heard bullets come from elsewhere. It is easy to shrug off eye-witness testimony, but consider if this wasn't Kennedy and there wasn't already a well-defined conspiracy theory. We have a few people who've been shot, and 96 eye-witnesses (well, ear-witnesses). The police, who have no idea how many shooters there were or where bullets came from, etc., ask the witnesses where they heard shots fired. They find that 35 of the witnesses heard bullets from Point A, 56 from Point B and 5 from both points. Why should we discount the testimony of 40 people who heard shots from Point A? Does my opponent have any evidence that this particular spot can produce immense ambiguity in what people sense? ---- EXIT/ENTRY WOUND? ---- After reading my opponent's source [ <URL>... ], I realize Dr. McClelland is uncertain either way about the nature of the wounds, so his testimony is useless. However, if we view the video my opponent provided in Round 2, is there any question that the fatal head shot came from the front of the vehicle (0:29)? ---- REENACTMENTS ""This article ( <URL>... ...) states that the FBI did in fact successfully reconstruct the scenario, with shot times averaging around 6 seconds for several different people. Consider also that Oswald had a rest for his rifle (the window) and would have already chambered the first round, greatly lessening the time needed to accurately aim. Furthermore, my opponent has already conceded this point - ""4) Oswald couldn't have gotten three shots off in the 6-8 second time frame he had."" I concede point 4 to my opponent..."" ---- I only conceded the time-limit, which leaves the former Marines unable to reconstruct the ""angle, the range, the moving target, the obstacles, everything"". The link my opponent provided does indeed provide details of a thorough reconstruction by the FBI, but this is the very reconstruction my sources were disputing as impossible. Marine Sniper Craig Roberts: ""First, I analyzed the scene as a sniper . . . I looked at the engagement angles. It was entirely wrong...Here, from what I could see, three problems arose that would influence my shots. First, the target was moving away at a drastic angle to the right from the window, meaning that I would have to position my body to compete with the wall and a set of vertical water pipes . . . This would be extremely difficult for a right-handed shooter. Second, I would have to be ready to fire exactly when the target emerged past some tree branches that obscured the kill zone. Finally, I would have to deal with two factors at the same time; the curve of the street, and the high-to-low angle formula--a law of physics Oswald would not have known."" Also, after doing a little more research, I have found that there were actually TEN objects struck by bullets. Can my opponent explain the information at the bottom of this page [ <URL>... ] regarding just how many objects were struck on that day? ""So let us count the OBJECTS STRUCK. (1) street (2) curb (3) manhole cover (4) JFK's back (5) JFK's throat (6) windshield (7) trim strip (8) street sign (9) Connelly (10) JFK's head. Additionally, we heard reports of a shot striking a curb along Elm, which was hastily covered up. Could Oswald--according to the Lone Assassin Theory--have struck all of these objects in six seconds? Not unless he was armed with an automatic rifle and a dozen bullets."" [1] Thanks to JCMT, I look forward to his rebuttal. [1] - <URL>...",0,leet4A1,"

I really don't think this is a plausible explanation at all. Considering bullets were only supposed to have come from one source (the book depository), it's very compelling to note that almost as many people heard bullets come from elsewhere. It is easy to shrug off eye-witness testimony, but consider if this wasn't Kennedy and there wasn't already a well-defined conspiracy theory. We have a few people who've been shot, and 96 eye-witnesses (well, ear-witnesses). The police, who have no idea how many shooters there were or where bullets came from, etc., ask the witnesses where they heard shots fired. They find that 35 of the witnesses heard bullets from Point A, 56 from Point B and 5 from both points. Why should we discount the testimony of 40 people who heard shots from Point A? Does my opponent have any evidence that this particular spot can produce immense ambiguity in what people sense?  
  
----  
EXIT/ENTRY WOUND?  
----  
After reading my opponent's source [  http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu...  ], I realize Dr. McClelland is uncertain either way about the nature of the wounds, so his testimony is useless. However, if we view the video my opponent provided in Round 2, is there any question that the fatal head shot came from the front of the vehicle (0:29)?  
  
----  
REENACTMENTS  
  
""This article (  http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu...  ...) states that the FBI did in fact successfully reconstruct the scenario, with shot times averaging around 6 seconds for several different people. Consider also that Oswald had a rest for his rifle (the window) and would have already chambered the first round, greatly lessening the time needed to accurately aim. Furthermore, my opponent has already conceded this point - ""4) Oswald couldn't have gotten three shots off in the 6-8 second time frame he had."" I concede point 4 to my opponent...""  
----  
I only conceded the time-limit, which leaves the former Marines unable to reconstruct the ""angle, the range, the moving target, the obstacles, everything"". The link my opponent provided does indeed provide details of a thorough reconstruction by the FBI, but this is the very reconstruction my sources were disputing as impossible.  
  
Marine Sniper Craig Roberts: ""First, I analyzed the scene as a sniper . . . I looked at the engagement angles. It was entirely wrong…Here, from what I could see, three problems arose that would influence my shots. First, the target was moving away at a drastic angle to the right from the window, meaning that I would have to position my body to compete with the wall and a set of vertical water pipes . . . This would be extremely difficult for a right-handed shooter. Second, I would have to be ready to fire exactly when the target emerged past some tree branches that obscured the kill zone. Finally, I would have to deal with two factors at the same time; the curve of the street, and the high-to-low angle formula—a law of physics Oswald would not have known.""  
  
Also, after doing a little more research, I have found that there were actually TEN objects struck by bullets. Can my opponent explain the information at the bottom of this page [  http://www.strike-the-root.com...  ] regarding just how many objects were struck on that day?  
  
""So let us count the OBJECTS STRUCK. (1) street (2) curb (3) manhole cover (4) JFK's back (5) JFK's throat (6) windshield (7) trim strip (8) street sign (9) Connelly (10) JFK's head. Additionally, we heard reports of a shot striking a curb along Elm, which was hastily covered up. Could Oswald--according to the Lone Assassin Theory--have struck all of these objects in six seconds? Not unless he was armed with an automatic rifle and a dozen bullets."" [1]  
  
Thanks to JCMT, I look forward to his rebuttal.

Their will always be discrimination, so this arguement will fall, because whether it is leagl or not, it will be discrimnated against.

Legalizing same sex marriage goes against religion, because of polygamy. If you really want me to argue that, then I must, because your arguements fall.

Now if the Earth was flat, the hull and mast would gradually become smaller until they both disappeared out of sight together.

If one bird mutates and grows an extra long beak which allows it to dig further down into the mud and catch more food, it will have the advantage over the bird that mutates a short beak that inhibits its feeding, causing it to starve. Thus the birds with longer beaks will prosper in that particular environment and pass on their genes to the subsequent generations.
