2,"Hm, I was going to go into an angle of refuting your definition and what not, but time restrictions force me to play under your definition. Very well, I'll go along with your definition. I would urge that a closer examination of your definition necessitates the following: a leader is greater if the social influence he exerts is a product of his own will, and not due to external circumstances/luck. Simply put, any lucky events that help my goal during my leadership does not necessarily reflect good leadership on my part (just that I'm lucky, or what not). In that case, Hitler was a good leader because he had impressive oratory power, charisma, and a perfect moment for taking advantage of the German people due to the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles, depression in 30's, etc. However, a large part of his success relies on the fact that the German people were particularly vulnerable -- at that point of time, many were out the streets looking for job, and in comes Hitler promising populist ideals and an idealized goal. Couple this with his charismatic public persona, and you have a nation quickly bowing down to his feet. While this is impressive in some ways, if the political and economic atmosphere of Germany were different (i.e. better), I suspect the outcome of the Nazi party and Hitler would be much more different, and insignificant. A counter example to your challenge of finding a ""better leader"" would be Alexander the Great. He is without a doubt of of the greatest military commanders, and his influence was immense (pushing Greek culture into foreign land, thus Hellenistic civilization).",1,TheSkeptic,"

The disagreement comes on importance. Pro places PAV above VRS. With PAV, he claims, voter abuse is more easily identified. However, as I stated in the first round, this does nothing to dissuade certain people from creating a number of 'suicide vote bomber' accounts. By definition, these accounts do not matter to the vote abuser, so he will not care if it is public knowledge that his account participated in vote abuse. Worse still, the damage is already done. Without a VRS, the suicide vote bomber account is highly successfull because his votes will remain, and he can create new accounts to repeat the process. In any Vote System Reform proposal, the VRS should be at the top of the list. The VRS is effective where the PAV is not. It dissuades people from attempting to abuse the voting system because their time will have been wasted once their accounts are banned. They would have no reason to even attempt such a thing when their actions literally produce no success. I admit, the PAV would be a very helpful companion to the VRS, since it would make it easier to identify abuse. However, the VRS should take first priority.

Note that I don't have to prove that modal realism is true, I merely have to demonstrate that it is a reasonable belief to hold. I gave three arguments in support of modal realism: (1) the fine tuning the of the universe; (2) the law of parsimony; and (3) assuming all other evidence is equal, it is a pragmatic belief to hold. Let's see how they have have held up thus far. === Pro Case === 1. Fine Tuning Con seems to agree that the universe *does* need to be finely tuned to permit life and that modal realism is at least a plausible explanation for how these conditions were met. I'm not sure what his objection is; he claims I haven't supported my contention, but doesn't mention how so. I'll leave this to my opponent to clarify in the latter rounds. 2. Modal realism is parsimonious Con expresses doubts regarding my sanity. This is nothing but an argument from incredulity.[1] Note that he hasn't actually argued against the law of parsimony; his sole objection has been that God would be an even simpler hypothesis. Con has not explained how this is so. Additionally, the existence of God does not conflict with modal realism. Indeed, the ""many worlds"" theodicy attempts to explain the existence of evil and suffering in the actual world by arguing that God created every possible world where the good outweighs the bad. 3. Pragmatism Con asks of mathematical sets ""they can be accepted as what?"" As real objects, like I explained. The same is true of possible worlds. Con claims that I have contradicted my point about the law of parsimony. I don't see how this is the case. If anything, modal realism offers us the simplest way of understanding the ideas outlined. === Con Case === ""Go get yourself into a proper course. You've plenty time to be dreaming when you're asleep."" I appreciate the Grinch's concern, but I'm actually only minoring in philosophy; I'm a neuroscience major with an emphasis in pre-med. ""It's not reasonable to believe in something you don't have reason to believe in."" This is merely restating the obvious; the whole point of the debate is to show that there are good reasons to believe that Santa Claus exists. This is a question begging tautology.[2] --- Conclusion --- In order to fulfill my BoP, I only have to prove that it is *reasonable* to believe that Santa Claus exists; not that Santa Claus actually exists. Toward that end, I have attempted to demonstrate that modal realism is at the very least plausible. I've completely refuted Con's objections to it. Con's only positive argument against the existence of Santa was clearly circular. The resolution is affirmed. References: 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>...",1,J.Kenyon,"

I'm not sure what his objection is; he claims I haven't supported my contention, but doesn't mention how so. I'll leave this to my opponent to clarify in the latter rounds.  
  
2. Modal realism is parsimonious  
  
Con expresses doubts regarding my sanity. This is nothing but an argument from incredulity.[1] Note that he hasn't actually argued against the law of parsimony; his sole objection has been that God would be an even simpler hypothesis. Con has not explained how this is so. Additionally, the existence of God does not conflict with modal realism. Indeed, the ""many worlds"" theodicy attempts to explain the existence of evil and suffering in the actual world by arguing that God created every possible world where the good outweighs the bad.  
  
3. Pragmatism  
  
Con asks of mathematical sets ""they can be accepted as what?"" As real objects, like I explained. The same is true of possible worlds.  
  
Con claims that I have contradicted my point about the law of parsimony. I don't see how this is the case. If anything, modal realism offers us the simplest way of understanding the ideas outlined.  
  
=== Con Case ===  
  
""Go get yourself into a proper course. You've plenty time to be dreaming when you're asleep.""  
  
I appreciate the Grinch's concern, but I'm actually only minoring in philosophy; I'm a neuroscience major with an emphasis in pre-med.  
  
""It's not reasonable to believe in something you don't have reason to believe in.""  
  
This is merely restating the obvious; the whole point of the debate is to show that there are good reasons to believe that Santa Claus exists. This is a question begging tautology.[2]  
  
--- Conclusion ---  
  
In order to fulfill my BoP, I only have to prove that it is *reasonable* to believe that Santa Claus exists; not that Santa Claus actually exists. Toward that end, I have attempted to demonstrate that modal realism is at the very least plausible. I've completely refuted Con's objections to it. Con's only positive argument against the existence of Santa was clearly circular.  
  
The resolution is affirmed.

19,"I would like to thank my opponent for his timely response. My opponent claims that the prisoner would not feel as much pain as they would in the electric chair. This is in fact, false. The electric chair happens very quick, and very fast. It is said by some that the person is dead before they can even feel anything. Also, the electric chair is not always what murderers get. Usually they get the lethal injection, or simply life in prison. On the other hand, you have no proof that the cannibals would not bring them any pain. But even if they did not, it would be a very good mental punishment. How would you feel if you knew you were going to be eaten in a few days. There would probably be less murders. Lastly, it is not only about revenge for the victims family. It would help the hungry people who cannot afford food. Millions of people die each year from starvation.

Now, one could argue that while we could not make the TOS cover 100% of everything, we could definitely make it more thorough so that few exception are needed. Of course, that is a double edged sword, in that making the TOS too long and too full of legalese will mean less people will read and understand them, thus undermine the very purpose of the TOS. 2) This is not a case of an exception anyway. People are not banned for violating the TOS. They are banned for ultimately causing more harm to DDO than good, and TOS violations are just the justification that is being used.

26,"I was involved in a rather unpleasant incident on a British Airways flight from Aberdeen to Heathrow recently. (1) The aircraft was an Airbus A319 with a single economy (coach) class cabin which was fitted with seats with a width of 17.0"" (2) and the aisle seat I was allocated was located next to a grossly overweight gentleman, whose considerable girth was overflowing onto my seat, thus preventing me from putting the armrest down or fastening my seatbelt. I therefore challenged the man and here is the gist of the ensuing confrontation: Me: Excuse me, you appear to be sitting on part of my seat, would you be kind enough to move over so I can sit down? Overweight Passenger: I'm sorry, but I'm as far over as I can get. Me: Then may I suggest you move somewhere else where there are two free seats together? Overweight Passenger: Well, I don't think there are any left. If only they made the seats bigger there wouldn't be a problem. Me: Well the seats seem big enough for everybody else and the fact is, there is a problem and that problem is that I paid over two hundred and fifty quid for a seat that is being partly occupied by a great sweating pile of flab, so what are you going to do about it, pieface? Overweight Passenger: Well, if you are going to take that attitude... Me: Yes I am going to take that attitude - I think I'm entitled to under the circumstances, don't you? I mean how much money did you contribute towards the cost of my seat? That's right, not a penny. So what makes you think you are entitled to sit on part of it then, eh? At this juncture a stewardess came up and asked if she could help so I politely explained the situation and asked her to displace the overweight passenger so that I could duly take my seat. However, she said that the plane was full and suggested that I take a jump seat instead. Naturally, I refused to sit on a tip-up seat at the front of the cabin being stared at by the rest of the passengers like I was some naughty schoolboy who'd been told to stand in the corner of the classroom as a punishment - what, just so that some greedy fat bloke could sit in the seat that I'd paid over 250 for? I don't think so! By then, the plane's engines were being wound up and the aircraft was clearly ready to push back from the gate. The stewardess started to get really anxious then because all passengers must by law be seated with belts fastened while the plane is taxiing, so she went into the cockpit. She reappeared a minute or two later, and said to me that she was very sorry, but since I was last on board the captain had instructed her to offload me and explained that the ground crew would rebook me onto the next available flight, unless I was willing to take a jump seat, of course. I suggested that it might be more appropriate, all considered, for the oversized gentleman whose blubber was spilling all over my seat to get the naughty chair, but she was afraid that jump seats were not designed to accommodate people of his size. So, given that the flight was only an hour and a half long, I reluctantly strapped myself into the jump seat and resigned myself to an uncomfortable journey watching old Five Bellies lolling around on my seat, scoffing airline grub and guzzling down bottle after bottle of complimentary booze. To my mind, there is something fundamentally unjust about people of normal weight having to make sacrifices for the fat on planes. After all, 99% of people who are overweight are so because they are greedy and lazy, not because they have some medical condition. (3) When I got back, I visited British Airways' website to check what their policy on seating the fat is. This is what it says: ""British Airways offers its customers the ability to book an extra seat. There are many reasons why a customer might book an extra seat, the most common are for...Personal comfort - The customer requires more space than one seat provides, due to oversize..."" (4) You will note that booking an extra seat is merely an option - it's not compulsory. However, it's a whole different ball game when it comes to baggage. If your hand luggage exceeds certain dimensions and cannot fit into the cradle at check-in, you are obliged to check it into the hold - which is something many airlines now charge for. (5) Surely the same principle should be applied to fat passengers? If they are unable to fit into a cradle measuring the dimensions of a seat, they should be made to pay for two seats or otherwise be refused boarding. Thank you.

To my mind, there is something fundamentally unjust about people of normal weight having to make sacrifices for the fat on planes. After all, 99% of people who are overweight are so because they are greedy and lazy, not because they have some medical condition. (3)  
  
When I got back, I visited British Airways' website to check what their policy on seating the fat is. This is what it says:  
  
""British Airways offers its customers the ability to book an extra seat. There are many reasons why a customer might book an extra seat, the most common are for...Personal comfort – The customer requires more space than one seat provides, due to oversize..."" (4)  
  
You will note that booking an extra seat is merely an option - it's not compulsory. However, it's a whole different ball game when it comes to baggage. If your hand luggage exceeds certain dimensions and cannot fit into the cradle at check-in, you are obliged to check it into the hold - which is something many airlines now charge for. (5)  
  
Surely the same principle should be applied to fat passengers? If they are unable to fit into a cradle measuring the dimensions of a seat, they should be made to pay for two seats or otherwise be refused boarding.  
  
Thank you.

The Infested Terrans have the capability to inflict up to 500 points of explosive splash damage to any unit or structure. To reach their full destructive potential, an Infested Terran must be commanded to target a specific unit or structure, but they can also be commanded to target an area within the proximity of several units or structures. The splash damage from the exploding Infested Terran will cause massive damage to all nearby targets. Thus once again the zerg have the advantage over terran because they can turn terran into suicide bombers working for them. Zerg also have the lurker. Lurkers emit waves of supra-dense spines against their enemies and actually burrow under the ground. Once underground, a Lurker can utilize a series of spines that rip up through the ground in a straight line from the Lurker to its target. These spines continue to their maximum attack range, regardless of where the targeted unit lies within that path and every enemy unit in the path of the spines will take damage.

In operation north woods parts of the government tried to get Kennedy to help stage a cuban attack on Florida so America could blame the communists and invade Cuba. Our government had done this stuff before so I find it very annoying when people like the amazing atheist think it's crazy to believe that our government will do it again. 1. Wolfgang Halbig is a national school safety consultant. He spent many years as a Florida state trooper and almost 25 years as a national school safety consultant. He was present at the columbine shooting. He has been to every state and helped train people how to keep schools safe. When sandy hook first Happened he donated money. He offered to help analyze the event. He than began to realize that there were many strange things about the official story. He began asking questions. The questions were not offensive. He wanted to know who declared the victims legally dead, who installed the security cameras, who ordered the porta poddys to the seen, who didn't let the EMTs in to the school ect. After about 10 months two plain clothes cops came to his house and told him bad stuff would happen if he didn't stop asking questions. Why would they try so hard to get him to stop asking basic questions? Why would they not answer the questions? They were not offensive and they were very easy. Than 2 months later he was visited by fbi officials who told him he was being charged with harassment. He didn't harass anyone. He asked basic questions. They asked him if he owned a gun and threatened him again. The lutenant of Newtown tried to shut him up to. He was being threatened for practicing his first amendment right. Here we have a situation where 20 children are injured and may be clinging to life. When the situation was nutralized they still didn't let EMTs in to the building. They didn't request trauma helicopters. The lutenant came to the seen two hours after it began. A kindergarten boy was told to wait in the room where the dead body's were until the seat guys got back. Meanwhile someone ordered porta podys to be sent in. Your worries about the porta posies but not the trauma helicopters? The cops parked 1/4 a mike away. The victims were declared dead in 11 minutes. Who declared them dead? Connecticut law says only a doctor can do that. On dr oz there was a little boy who said they were having a drill while explaining his view of what happened to dr oz. I would like to mention how Robbie Parker tells us exactly my how to donate money to him. After his child was killed he's thinking about money?. 27 million dollars were collected in donations for Newtown. Most of the victims families got free houses on December 25 2009 (Connecticut online data base) the cops were given a big check by Eric holder, each family got 281,000 from the state. Chris menfrodenia claimed he was on his way to make gingerbread houses with his daughters class room...I camo pants and a black jacket? Kathy gaubert is a women from Georgia. A picture of her daughter lily gaubert was taken off her Instagram and used was Allison Wyatt. It was even used on professional official sandy hook sites. Kathy finally pointed out that her daughter lives in Georgia and does not attend sandy hook. We've never seen or heard from Allison's parents. In the video of the Parker family that amazing atheist has Samantha and Madeline don't have legs. Why did they photoshop this picture. Adam Lanza was autistic. People with autism have poor motor skills. He was also 110 pounds soaking wet. He couldn't have physically carried 40 pounds of military equipment in the school and shot 26 people in 5-7 minutes with out any help. He had limited training as well. A couple target practices with mom doesn't prepare you for something like that. In columbine the shooters killed 13 people in an hour and this one guy kills 26 in 6 minutes?.

He was present at the columbine shooting. He has been to every state and helped train people how to keep schools safe. When sandy hook first Happened he donated money. He offered to help analyze the event. He than began to realize that there were many strange things about the official story. He began asking questions. The questions were not offensive. He wanted to know who declared the victims legally dead, who installed the security cameras, who ordered the porta poddys to the seen, who didn't let the EMTs in to the school ect. After about 10 months two plain clothes cops came to his house and told him bad stuff would happen if he didn't stop asking questions. Why would they try so hard to get him to stop asking basic questions? Why would they not answer the questions? They were not offensive and they were very easy. Than 2 months later he was visited by fbi officials who told him he was being charged with harassment. He didn't harass anyone. He asked basic questions. They asked him if he owned a gun and threatened him again. The lutenant of Newtown tried to shut him up to. He was being threatened for practicing his first amendment right.  
Here we have a situation where 20 children are injured and may be clinging to life. When the situation was nutralized they still didn't let EMTs in to the building. They didn't request trauma helicopters. The lutenant came to the seen two hours after it began. A kindergarten boy was told to wait in the room where the dead body's were until the seat guys got back. Meanwhile someone ordered porta podys to be sent in. Your worries about the porta posies but not the trauma helicopters? The cops parked 1/4 a mike away. The victims were declared dead in 11 minutes. Who declared them dead? Connecticut law says only a doctor can do that. On dr oz there was a little boy who said they were having a drill while explaining his view of what happened to dr oz.  
I would like to mention how Robbie Parker tells us exactly my how to donate money to him. After his child was killed he's thinking about money?. 27 million dollars were collected in donations for Newtown. Most of the victims families got free houses on December 25 2009 (Connecticut online data base) the cops were given a big check by Eric holder, each family got 281,000 from the state.  
Chris menfrodenia claimed he was on his way to make gingerbread houses with his daughters class room...I camo pants and a black jacket?  
Kathy gaubert is a women from Georgia. A picture of her daughter lily gaubert was taken off her Instagram and used was Allison Wyatt. It was even used on professional official sandy hook sites. Kathy finally pointed out that her daughter lives in Georgia and does not attend sandy hook. We've never seen or heard from Allison's parents. In the video of the Parker family that amazing atheist has Samantha and Madeline don't have legs. Why did they photoshop this picture.  
Adam Lanza was autistic. People with autism have poor motor skills. He was also 110 pounds soaking wet. He couldn't have physically carried 40 pounds of military equipment in the school and shot 26 people in 5-7 minutes with out any help. He had limited training as well. A couple target practices with mom doesn't prepare you for something like that. In columbine the shooters killed 13 people in an hour and this one guy kills 26 in 6 minutes?.

38,"Despite the one-sidedness of this topic, I will argue against my opponent that the previously stated phrases are not all puns. Of course, because of how interpretive this topic is, I cannot disprove ALL of the phrases in being puns. However, I am not required to. Because of my opponents statement that ""The following are puns"" I know that he is arguing under the belief that every mentioned phrase was a pun. I must only determine that at least ONE of the above phrases are not a pun to disprove him. For this, I will choose the phrase: ""...you can't have your kayak and heat it too."" Now I realize the intended pun in this situation. It is arguing that this phrase sounds like, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" However, according to my opponents preferred definition of a pun, it is clearly not. As clearly defined by my opponent, a pun is play on words either by interchanging different senses/definition/interpretations of a same word, or else a similar sense/definition/interpretation and sound of a different word. The words 'kayak' and 'cake' do not share either of these similarities. Kayak is pronounced kaiak (according to <URL>... ) and does not have any different sense other than: an Eskimo canoe made of a frame covered with skins except for a small opening in the center and propelled by a double-bladed paddle (according to <URL>... ). Therefore, it does not meet the first said qualifier of a pun. The arguable qualifier for this word, kayak, as a pun, would be that it shares the the similar sense/definition of the word 'cake' by linking it via a similar sound. However, the only similarity here between the two sounds is the beginning sounds of 'kuh' and the ending sounds of 'kuh'. This is HARDLY enough evidence to prove that ""...you can't have your kayak and heat it too"" is a pun. Please bear with me as I give an example: Two men sit on a bench. They both watch by-passers walk by until one passing man falls to the ground and dies. They both look at the man on the ground until one says, ""Thats the third time today."" ""Yep,"" the other agrees. ""They're just dropping like floss."" Now if you think a long time about this scenario, you realize that its not funny. The joke is obviously intended to compare ""dropping like flies"" to ""dropping like floss"", but the word floss isn't at ALL related to the story at all. This is the same as my opponent's phrase. Both share the similar beginning sounds (kuh and kuh in kayak as to the kuh and kuh in cake AS does the fuh and seh in flies compare to the fuh and seh in floss) but neither are funny or related and neither can be considered puns. Now say that, perhaps, my story was revised to that the men falling down dead were dentists. Then MAYBE it could be considered a pun because of the facetious relationship between the vaguely similar words and the subject. HOWEVER, my opponent's ""pun"" has no such link between his random words and the story. IF the words kayak and cake shared a similar middle sound as well as the beginning and ending similarities, then the pun argument might have some bearing. However, they do not. To strengthen my argument, I will state that there is only one pronunciation of kayak as cited in these numerous sites: <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Unless my opponent has found the pun somewhere else in the phrase debated, of which I am glad to listen to, my conjecture is inarguably correct. To summarize my points: 1. I need only to disprove one of my opponent's ""puns"" to disprove his contention 2. Kayak and cake haven't enough sound similarity to be considered a pun 3. There is no loop hole around the pronunciation of ""kayak"" 4.
