1,"First, in closing thank you to my opponent! I enjoyed this exchange, and I greatly admire the intellect my opponent has displayed during the discourse of this debate. History, Legality, and US Foreign Policy: Rwanda: I know the debate isn't about this specifically, however, I must reply, having read Romeo Dallaire's Shake Hands with the Devil this Canadian General showed evidence and his own testimony that the forces in Rwanda even knew about the genocides were going to happen before they actually did and still refused to do anything, and the only forces to enter were Belgium, and Sudan soldiers dawning the UN Barrets. Dallaire was told to stand down, even when he knew where the arms caches to committ the genocides were and even varified. The UN prevented him from doing anything. Secondly, as I noted earlier my opponent cites the failures or inconsistencies of US foreign policy during the course of this debate. As I noted earlier this is irrelevant, he makes an appeal to hypocracy when doing so. The problem with places such as Guatamala, for instance, or indigenous removal during the US presidency of Andrew Jackson, or the Iran-Contra affairs is the context in which they take place to justify their legitimacy or not. For instance, the native removal lacked UN body existing at that time to set up a framework of legality or not. Whereas today we do, and we're only talking about Iraq under Bush Jr. Not any other time of war. Furthermore, I agree that what is inconsistant is the application of enforcement, but that's precisely why me and my opponent agree here and discus Rwanda, we see what happens when it is unenforced, a national outrage and death ensure, which is an argument for invasion not against it. My opponent further submits the conduct of the US was poor, that the framework for the legitimization is unfounded. But the documents notes that they (being the US and Iraq) were never coerced into signing, thus the consent of both parties still remains to the document, so I kindly disagree with my oponent here, he should accept the framework for it, this is also because of Nuremburg, Eichmann, Yugoslavia, etc... And although the conduct was poor, this ignores the scandals in which the people prosecuted for it, and furthermore, ignores the JWT. Even then, it's once again an appeal to hypocracy and is irrelevant. There will always be unintentional deaths in War, what matters is the intention in which it takes place. Which was to liberate a people who were massively persecuted. Should they have been left to fend for themselves they would have surely died. The articles: but it does state may , they have the option of giving that consent or not, and even then it is widely known that the UN only can enforce her laws on the basis of voluntarism. The UN can only make recommendations, not enforce the laws it's self, that it requires on it's members. Canada's handling of the native pop. is an example of this. Furthermore, as noted earlier the cases of Yugoslavia, Nuremburg, Eichmann, etc.. All put the genocide conventions in context, that an ""exception"" can be made legally for the party enforcing the law, so long as other means have been tried. The Iraqi Oil for food program didn't work, what esle was there? Invasion. Iraq didn't despute it's legitimacy, nor did it make an exception to the conventions to recognize her constitution over those docs when signing (as noted earlier) case and point, the competent UN organs can be consulted, but the US did simply by using the Conventions. Finally the JWT may use any of those justifications for invasion, I make the case for military necessity due to the pragmatic application of war, a general would be a fool to invade and expect so much as 1 civillian casualty to be criminal, it realistically isn't possible when all other means were tried and death still resulted espescially in the Iraqi Oil program. What else was there? Death by being idle? Or death via invasion for liberation? In short, I still feel the legality of the war is justified. The basis of International Law in which it rests upon may indeed be flawed, but it is necessary. It saved the Kurdish people. Why Vote for Me? Indeed, this shall be a tough case, I have a worthy foe however, here is why I feel I won. -The framework of International Law was used in Eichmann, Nuremburg, etc... so the legality of the framework in it's practical application may be flawed, but it does work and is enforceable. -The Genocide Conventions, Geneva Conventions justify invasion when considering the Oil for Food Program and it's failures, you cannot force Iraq to take food. -UN works on the principals of vulintarism -The inconsistancies of the application for war is Irrelevant (appeal to hypocracy) -Justified on principal (enemy of man, universial jurisdiction, etc..) and humanitarian grounds (no despute that Saddam was a tyrant in need of removal. -The conduct of the US was poor at times, however those people were arrested and tried when they happened. Outrage ensued by public. -We have seen the effects of genocide before, they are not pretty, and thus, there should be no question that invasion was the way to go (espescially Rwanda and the prior knowledge) -There was 12 reasons for going to war, the US only got 2 half-wrong. One of which was the killing of kurds, which is covered under the conventions. Thank you to my opponent for a pleasant exchange! I hope we have the fun of debating one another again in a later date! *Shakes opponents hand* Thank you!

2,"Alrighty then. Allow me to lay out my case for the affirmative. C1) Similar Interests The U.S. and Israel have morals, rights, and values that reflect each other. What is unique about Israel is that it holds values that are humane when compared with its neighboring countries. Israel has many of the same freedoms that are given in the U.S. Constitution, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly[1]. It can be described as a ""monument of democracy and stability in a region where's there's been little of either""[2]. Since the U.S. holds these values, rights, and morals as important, it has a reason to strengthen other countries such as Israel in order to promote them and keep them existent and alive in a world where rights are often abused. If we were to cut our support, Israel would be weakened and thus more likely to be overrun by surrounding Arab states that do not share these basic human rights. Saudi Arabia is regarded as one of the countries with the lowest political rights and civil liberties[3]. It along with Israel's neighbors, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine are all regarded as ""not free"" with limited rights in each. Saudi Arabia has serious problems with human trafficking, discrimination against women, lack of freedom of religion or speech, and executions of homosexuals[4]. Many of these things can be said for surrounding Arab theocratic states with severe problems. That being said, the strengthening and promotion of these interests are critical in the Middle East, and ought to be acknowledged by the U.S. through an alliance. Political influence has worked before, and can work with Israel and its neighboring countries too. C2) Peace One of the major goals of surrounding Arab countries is to destroy Israel. They have refused to negotiate on treaties and have allowed groups such as Hamas's organization to repeatedly launch rockets into Israel. The IDF has reacted with counter attacks as a means of self-defense, in order to keep Hamas's group away from their country. Israel has had a history of attempts to establish peace with help from the U.S. Their Declaration of Independence reads: "" We appeal in the very midst of the onslaught launched against us now for months to the Arab inhabitants of the state of Israel, to preserve peace and participate in the upbuilding of the state on the basis of full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions. We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their peoples in an offer of peace and good neighborliness, and appeal to them to establish bonds of cooperation and mutual help with the sovereign Jewish people settled in its own land. The State of Israel is prepared to do its share in a common effort for the advancement of the entire Middle East. ""[5] In the past, there have been many attempts to establish peace from Israel, including Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty in 1979[6] and the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty in 1994[7]. The U.S. has historically encouraged these treaties and has made sure that both sides agree to them. However, these instances of peace often exist for short periods of time before violence erupts again. Since peace in the area is something that would be beneficial to everyone, Israel needs America's help through alliance to further work towards establishing peace with the help of Israel.

3,"I'll keep this one short. Since my opponent has no sources to back up his claims I won't give him the benefit of listing mine either. 1) My opponent focuses on the American lives saved, but admits higher casualties. Why does he suppose an American life is more important than any other race's life? Of course they might become insurgents, but so could anyone else, so by my opponent's logic we should kill the entire planet to wipe out insurgency. Further, my opponent fails to relize that one can conceal the entrance to an underground lair, thus thwarting the visual sensors of the drones. My opponent will never win the war on terror by this plan - if civilians become more bombed, more people hate United States, more people join Al Qaeda, simple as that! And you won't even be able to kill Al Qaeda because Al Qaeda knows where to hide, so really you'll just be doing free recruitment for Al Qaeda at a higher cost than it would to get rid of them, as foot soldiers have a proven history of doing. 2) When a terrorist does a suicide bombing, that is not cowardice, that is the ultimate bravery (or so it is percieved) because one has the courage to take up Jihad against the most powerful nation on Earth. If you do not show bravery in your fight, people in Iraq, Afghanistan etc will become angry at you, quit the army that NATO has created in these places and join the Taliban movement. Also, just to remind my opponent, the four years after the States killed al-Zarqawi were the deadliest for troops from that country, and all the martyr videos said the deaths were retribution for al-Zarqawi's death. Finally, my opponent thinks that by conquering all Al Qaeda territory he will conquer Al Qaeda. Not at all. Al Qaeda is a worldwide network, operating in many countries - from Australia to the United States to Uganda (though luckily not my native New Zealand). Osama himself has stated he is not to be found there, but ""amongst the Muslim masses."" 3) Every war is preventable. Take this one in Iraq. Solution - don't invade Iraq (who were clearly not more of a security threat than, say, Israel). Or the one in Afghanistan. Solution - stop the weapons trade with Israel (Al Qaeda has stated that if this happens, they will bring their leaders to the negotiating table). I challenge my opponent to cite a single inevitable war. If we could stop the Cold War from heating, we can stop any war. But this wasn't even my point! The United States, regardless of whether they are the strongest nation in the world or not, has no more right to start wars than any other country. This is guaranteed by international treaties that the United States has ratified. Future governments may begin to start wars at a whim if no human risk is involved. I'm sure my opponent can think where this is leading, three superpowers or so conquer Earth and the book ""1984"" by George Orwell plays out exactly. 4) OK, so we hold the pilots to account, or more accurately, those who failed to give them training in how to recognize the difference between a civilian and a soldier (which is impossible using a drone, meaning any use of a drone should result in prosecution). What difference does it make? It's still illegal. Hiroshima and Nagasaki was before the Geneva convention, which was written after World War 2 to prevent things like Hiroshima or NAZI war crimes from happening again. Like most laws it's not retrospective, so the bomber pilots have immunity. My opponent looks only to saving the lives of Americans whose job it is to put their life on the line for their country. What about innocents in far away lands who only wish to live in peace? Like I said, at least 207 of these people died in an attempt to kill just one Taliban leader using drones. More civilians died in just this one campaign than US soldiers died in all US campaigns over that whole year. If my opponent thinks he knows better than the CIA on piloting drones, I suggest he tries to tell that to them, not me. Drones are prone to failing and crashing, as well as misidentifying targets, not hitting underground targets, recruiting terrorists, proving United States cowardice, breaking the law and promoting a 1984-style world. If drones were people I think the whole world would unanimously call for their death sentence. Actually I should start a chant: ""Death to the Drones! Con! Con! Con!""",1,larztheloser,"
  
I'll keep this one short. Since my opponent has no sources to back up his claims I won't give him the benefit of listing mine either.  
  
1) My opponent focuses on the American lives saved, but admits higher casualties. Why does he suppose an American life is more important than any other race's life? Of course they might become insurgents, but so could anyone else, so by my opponent's logic we should kill the entire planet to wipe out insurgency. Further, my opponent fails to relize that one can conceal the entrance to an underground lair, thus thwarting the visual sensors of the drones. My opponent will never win the war on terror by this plan - if civilians become more bombed, more people hate United States, more people join Al Qaeda, simple as that! And you won't even be able to kill Al Qaeda because Al Qaeda knows where to hide, so really you'll just be doing free recruitment for Al Qaeda at a higher cost than it would to get rid of them, as foot soldiers have a proven history of doing.  
  
2) When a terrorist does a suicide bombing, that is not cowardice, that is the ultimate bravery (or so it is percieved) because one has the courage to take up Jihad against the most powerful nation on Earth. If you do not show bravery in your fight, people in Iraq, Afghanistan etc will become angry at you, quit the army that NATO has created in these places and join the Taliban movement. Also, just to remind my opponent, the four years after the States killed al-Zarqawi were the deadliest for troops from that country, and all the martyr videos said the deaths were retribution for al-Zarqawi's death. Finally, my opponent thinks that by conquering all Al Qaeda territory he will conquer Al Qaeda. Not at all. Al Qaeda is a worldwide network, operating in many countries - from Australia to the United States to Uganda (though luckily not my native New Zealand). Osama himself has stated he is not to be found there, but ""amongst the Muslim masses.""  
  
3) Every war is preventable. Take this one in Iraq. Solution - don't invade Iraq (who were clearly not more of a security threat than, say, Israel). Or the one in Afghanistan. Solution - stop the weapons trade with Israel (Al Qaeda has stated that if this happens, they will bring their leaders to the negotiating table). I challenge my opponent to cite a single inevitable war. If we could stop the Cold War from heating, we can stop any war. But this wasn't even my point! The United States, regardless of whether they are the strongest nation in the world or not, has no more right to start wars than any other country. This is guaranteed by international treaties that the United States has ratified. Future governments may begin to start wars at a whim if no human risk is involved. I'm sure my opponent can think where this is leading, three superpowers or so conquer Earth and the book ""1984"" by George Orwell plays out exactly.  
  
4) OK, so we hold the pilots to account, or more accurately, those who failed to give them training in how to recognize the difference between a civilian and a soldier (which is impossible using a drone, meaning any use of a drone should result in prosecution). What difference does it make? It's still illegal. Hiroshima and Nagasaki was before the Geneva convention, which was written after World War 2 to prevent things like Hiroshima or NAZI war crimes from happening again. Like most laws it's not retrospective, so the bomber pilots have immunity.  
  
My opponent looks only to saving the lives of Americans whose job it is to put their life on the line for their country. What about innocents in far away lands who only wish to live in peace? Like I said, at least 207 of these people died in an attempt to kill just one Taliban leader using drones. More civilians died in just this one campaign than US soldiers died in all US campaigns over that whole year. If my opponent thinks he knows better than the CIA on piloting drones, I suggest he tries to tell that to them, not me. Drones are prone to failing and crashing, as well as misidentifying targets, not hitting underground targets, recruiting terrorists, proving United States cowardice, breaking the law and promoting a 1984-style world. If drones were people I think the whole world would unanimously call for their death sentence.

10,"I would like to thank acer for accepting this challenge. ===Answering my opponent's first objection=== ""Once your [sic] hooked, you are probably going to be hooked for a while."" The human body is ""hooked"" on many other substances that aren't drugs, like food and water, except to a much larger degree. To advocate for mind-altering drugs to be illegal on this premise should include an advocation for food and water to be illegal as well. ===The Flaw in My Opponent's Crime Definition Premise=== My opponent's case relies solely on the premise that something making one more likely to commit crimes should be illegal. Given this, we can derive that sororities should also be illegal. This is because their existence increases the chance of sexual assault[1]. Parties and celebrations should also be illegal because they also increase the chances of rape[1]. School uniforms also increase the chance of rape[2] and should therefore be illegal under my opponent's case. Given that these things are now illegal, the government must seek out ways to decrease the chance of these actions being taken as well and eliminate them, according to my opponent's premise. If people have the freedom to gather in one place, they are more likely to celebrate or party, and therefore such an action should also be illegal. Given that when we follow my opponent's premise, gathering together should be illegal, religion must be illegal as well, because religious groups are more likely to gather on a regular basis than nonreligious groups. It should be obvious that in the United States of America, we should not base our laws on my opponent's premise, because it would lead to Unconstitutional restrictions in the name of fighting crime. Therefore, the slippery-slope crime premise is invalid. ===Why My Crime Defintion Premise is Valid=== The purpose of government is to protect its people's rights to govern their life and property[3]. Under this premise, crime is an act of coercion, denying another their rights to govern life and property. Such acts of coercion would be theft and rape. When government seeks to decrease the chances of such crimes occuring, they themselves commit a crime, by infringing on one's right to govern their life and property according to their own pursuit of happiness. Therefore, such an act of government as Drug Criminalization is an unwarranted and coercive abuse of government authority. I will now allow my opponent to respond. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

Given this, we can derive that sororities should also be illegal. This is because their existence increases the chance of sexual assault[1]. Parties and celebrations should also be illegal because they also increase the chances of rape[1].  
School uniforms also increase the chance of rape[2] and should therefore be illegal under my opponent's case.  
  
Given that these things are now illegal, the government must seek out ways to decrease the chance of these actions being taken as well and eliminate them, according to my opponent's premise. If people have the freedom to gather in one place, they are more likely to celebrate or party, and therefore such an action should also be illegal.  
  
Given that when we follow my opponent's premise, gathering together should be illegal, religion must be illegal as well, because religious groups are more likely to gather on a regular basis than nonreligious groups.  
  
It should be obvious that in the United States of America, we should not base our laws on my opponent's premise, because it would lead to Unconstitutional restrictions in the name of fighting crime.  
  
Therefore, the slippery-slope crime premise is invalid.  
  
===Why My Crime Defintion Premise is Valid===  
  
The purpose of government is to protect its people's rights to govern their life and property[3]. Under this premise, crime is an act of coercion, denying another their rights to govern life and property. Such acts of coercion would be theft and rape.  
  
When government seeks to decrease the chances of such crimes occuring, they themselves commit a crime, by infringing on one's right to govern their life and property according to their own pursuit of happiness.  
  
Therefore, such an act of government as Drug Criminalization is an unwarranted and coercive abuse of government authority.  
  
I will now allow my opponent to respond.

19,"It is my intention to give sufficient reason for the resolution, 'The United States Government should not recognize the results of the recent Nicaraguan election' The Nicaraguan national election was held last Sunday, November 6th. The controversy of the election started before the election. 1. Constitutionally illegitimate candidate: Daniel Ortega was violating the Nicaraguan constitution in both the term limits, and the running consecutive terms. In the Nicaraguan constitution it is stipulated that the president cannot run for more than two terms, and a president cannot run in consecutive terms. This is to prevent a dictatorial regime, and put a safeguard on the democratic process. Simply by running he is in violation of the country's constitution, and his blatant disregard for the rule of law, and the rule of the land is justification alone for a country that values the integrity of the electoral process to not acknowledge this man in his bid for re-election. [1] [Although the elections of the national seats that took place in this last election are also fraught with fraud, I will keep the argument to Daniel Ortega, since he is running as President, and it is he who the US Government would recognize.] It is key in understanding how Ortega has held and grown his control over the country, by understanding the role his party, the Sandinista Party his played in the country since he gained control. All possible judges, particularly Supreme Court Judges, and election officials are Sandinista, all police force and military forces are loyal to the Sandinistas over the Nicaraguan people. Sufficient branches of government and those with influence over the economy are loyal Sandinistas to facilitate Ortega's designs. 2. Fraudulent electoral process: The Ortega administration mandated, prior to the election, an identity card would be required for the election, and these cards would need to be obtained through members of the FSLN (Sandinista Party). Members of FSLN easily and quickly received their cards, whereas other requestors of the identity cards were waiting for a year or more. Essentially Ortega achieved an election that would be wholly managed by his party the Sandinistas, and two thirds of the places in Nicaragua were run by Sandinistas, and those that were not had the greatest instances of identity card rejection.[ 2] At the time of election the voter must present this identity card, and it must have an authorized stamp that the Sandinistas created. Without that stamp the identity card was invalid, and countless identity cards were found invalid because they did not have the proper stamp, all those people were not Sandinista. The incidents of fraud are too numerous to list, and was so rampant that it will never be truly documented. [3] The entire election was controlled and managed by the Sandinistas under the dictates of Daniel Ortega, for the benefit of Daniel Ortega's reelection and total control over the Nicaraguan people. [4] 3. Impact of fraudulent election in Nicaragua: With a total disregard to the constitution in the running of Daniel Ortega as president violating the constitution, and the principles that safe guard its people from a dictator he degrades the constitution in its intended purpose of providing a democratic rule of checks and balances over the land. What is even more important to note is that if a president is elected with more than 50% of the popular vote he is empowered to change the constitution as he sees fit. This is a massive coup of power to the presidency, and by illegally obtaining that number of votes he has effectively taken control of all aspects of governance within the country. It is a true theft of total power with the obvious intentions of a dictatorial regime in perpetuity. It is also important to understand the corruption within the Ortega regime, and the personal corruption of the man. He has become one of the richest men in Central America, leader of the second poorest countries in the hemisphere. He has skimmed oil wealth from his mentor Hugo Chavez, and has instituted a party and government of kleptocracy beyond anything people commonly know about. [6] [7] 4. Organizations and Governments of the world community not recognizing the election: [8] European Union Organization of American States Honduras Canada Costa Rica Panama Israel 5. Countries and organizations that recognize Daniel Ortega as the duly elected leader of Nicaragua: Cuba Venezuela El Salvador ALBA (client states Hugo Chavez) [9] Russia [10] 6. Why the US position should be firm against recognition: In our hemisphere in particular it is important as both a leader of the world, and a member of the world community to take a position of intolerance to would be dictators who corrupt the very mechanism of democracy in order that they may amass more power and more wealth at the expense of the very poor. As long as we are the prominent member of the world stage, and one who hopes to encourage the values of freedom and democracy the United States must join other countries who do not give any legitimacy to an election that was not just stolen but orchestrated in the most blatant of attempts to emasculate any opposition, and to entrench a putrefied regime. It is beyond obvious that the US government should not recognize the results of the recent Nicaraguan election; it would be borderline accessory to a crime to provide an ounce of legitimacy to this farce, and an insult to the Nicaraguans who are fighting against this fraud with their lives. 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>... 5.

The controversy of the election started before the election.  1.   Constitutionally illegitimate candidate:     Daniel Ortega was violating the Nicaraguan constitution in both the term limits, and the running consecutive terms.   In the Nicaraguan constitution it is stipulated that the president cannot run for more than two terms, and a president cannot run in consecutive terms. This is to prevent a dictatorial regime, and put a safeguard on the democratic process. Simply by running he is in violation of the country's constitution, and his blatant disregard for the rule of law, and the rule of the land is justification alone for a country that values the integrity of the electoral process to not acknowledge this man in his bid for re-election. [1]  [Although the elections of the national seats that took place in this last election are also fraught with fraud, I will keep the argument to Daniel Ortega, since he is running as President, and it is he who the US Government would recognize.]  It is key in understanding how Ortega has held and grown his control over the country, by understanding the role his party, the Sandinista Party his played in the country since he gained control. All possible judges, particularly Supreme Court Judges, and election officials are Sandinista, all police force and military forces are loyal to the Sandinistas over the Nicaraguan people. Sufficient branches of government and those with influence over the economy are loyal Sandinistas to facilitate Ortega's designs.   2.   Fraudulent electoral process:     The Ortega administration mandated, prior to the election, an identity card would be required for the election, and these cards would need to be obtained through members of the FSLN (Sandinista Party). Members of FSLN easily and quickly received their cards, whereas other requestors of the identity cards were waiting for a year or more. Essentially Ortega achieved an election that would be wholly managed by his party the Sandinistas, and two thirds of the places in Nicaragua were run by Sandinistas, and those that were not had the greatest instances of identity card rejection.[ 2]      At the time of election the voter must present this identity card, and it must have an authorized stamp that the Sandinistas created. Without that stamp the identity card was invalid, and countless identity cards were found invalid because they did not have the proper stamp, all those people were not Sandinista. The incidents of fraud are too numerous to list, and was so rampant that it will never be truly documented. [3] The entire election was controlled and managed by the Sandinistas under the dictates of Daniel Ortega, for the benefit of Daniel Ortega's reelection and total control over the Nicaraguan people. [4]  3.   Impact of fraudulent election in Nicaragua:     With a total disregard to the constitution in the running of Daniel Ortega as president violating the constitution, and the principles that safe guard its people from a dictator he degrades the constitution in its intended purpose of providing a democratic rule of checks and balances over the land.      What is even more important to note is that if a president is elected with more than 50% of the popular vote he is empowered to change the constitution as he sees fit.   This is a massive coup of power to the presidency, and by illegally obtaining that number of votes he has effectively taken control of all aspects of governance within the country. It is a true theft of total power with the obvious intentions of a dictatorial regime in perpetuity.     It is also important to understand the corruption within the Ortega regime, and the personal corruption of the man. He has become one of the richest men in Central America, leader of the second poorest countries in the hemisphere. He has skimmed oil wealth from his mentor Hugo Chavez, and has instituted a party and government of kleptocracy beyond anything people commonly know about. [6] [7]  4.   Organizations and Governments of the world community not recognizing the election:   [8]  European Union  Organization of American States  Honduras  Canada  Costa Rica  Panama  Israel     5.   Countries and organizations that recognize Daniel Ortega as the duly elected leader of Nicaragua:  Cuba  Venezuela  El Salvador  ALBA (client states Hugo Chavez) [9]   Russia [10]     6.   Why the US position should be firm against recognition:  In our hemisphere in particular it is important as both a leader of the world, and a member of the world community to take a position of intolerance to would be dictators who corrupt the very mechanism of democracy in order that they may amass more power and more wealth at the expense of the very poor. As long as we are the prominent member of the world stage, and one who hopes to encourage the values of freedom and democracy the United States must join other countries who do not give any legitimacy to an election that was not just stolen but orchestrated in the most blatant of attempts to emasculate any opposition, and to entrench a putrefied regime.   It is beyond obvious that the US government should not recognize the results of the recent Nicaraguan election; it would be borderline accessory to a crime to provide an ounce of legitimacy to this farce, and an insult to the Nicaraguans who are fighting against this fraud with their lives.      1.   http://pdba.georgetown.edu...  2.   http://www.lab.org.uk...  3.   http://www.confidencial.com.ni...  4.   http://www.radio-corporacion.com...  5.

Chavez also bought 100,000 AK-103 and AK-104 assault rifles that were delivered in 2006.

26,"I request that my opponent include either source footnotes or the links in the text of his argument so that the readers and I can trace each claim back to its specific source. This is to prevent confusion and make sure that each claim made isn't made up. It also prevents extra work for the readers and I to do. Con has split his round into rebutting my case and making his own. I'll first defend mine, then address his. Pro's Case Similar Interests 1. Con completely missed the point of this argument. Israel may not have perfect racial laws, but they are significantly better than those of the surrounding Arab states, some of whom still practice slavery and are ruled by oppressive theocracies with restricted human rights. My argument was that Israel's relatively similar interests to America mean that an alliance between the two countries could be a political influence on the Arab states. Even if Con can argue that Israel still has a few issues, he has to admit that they are *far* better than those of Jordan, Syria, Yemen Saudi Arabia, etc. I proved this in the last round by showing the lack of rights in each of these countries in contrast with Israel. 2. The fact that Israel isn't perfect strengthens my point about using the alliance as an influence on the Middle East. If Israel were to cut its influential connection with the U.S., its hope of abandoning its racial laws would be reduced. This country needs Western influence if there is any future for its religious laws. 3. Con's mentioning of me ""painting Palestine as an oppressive state"" is a red herring. It has very little to do with the resolution, and I'm not sure sure what Con is trying to prove by trying to promote it. Palestine is a tiny area, so the fact that my opponent acknowledged it and not the other nations is odd.

My opponent does not dispute that Israel has attempted peace several times in the past, thus conceding that it has.

This is an astounding example of the measures that Israel will go to in order to keep peace between the nations[3]. 2.

Con seems to be hinting that if the U.S. cut support with Israel then militant groups such as Al Qaeda would either die off or stop rising up against it. This is very far from the truth. If the U.S. cut its support, Israel would be rendered more vulnerable to terrorist groups such as Hamas and Al Qaeda, which is the exact opposite of what we want. Thus it is more logical for America to hold fast with Israel as it is set up for potential destruction. Cost This is actually quite minor of a point because it hinges on whether or not the alliance with Israel is worth keeping or not. If I can show that that the alliance is a net benefit, then a reader must agree that more lives saved is better than a few more dollars paid. This point doesn't really show how giving aid to another country is a bad thing unless we all assume that the alliance is pointless, which I have shown that it isn't. America's funding of Israeli military and the IDF is crucial for the protection and survival of its citizens. In the recent conflict, Hamas's organization has been shooting rockets into the area of Israel and has caused civilians to die. The situation for them is real and much more important than ours when it comes to a bit of money. If the U.S. denied aid to them simply because ""it costs too much"", why is the alternative of a weaker Israel the better option? Con needs to show that the money spent helping their military isn't worth it in order to make their point. This is like saying that donating to charity is a bad idea because it takes money out of people's pockets. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>...",1,Varrack,"
  
  I request that my opponent include either source footnotes or the links in the text of his argument so that the readers and I can trace each claim back to its specific source. This is to prevent confusion and make sure that each claim made isn't made up. It also prevents extra work for the readers and I to do.  Con has split his round into rebutting my case and making his own. I'll first defend mine, then address his.  
        
  Pro's Case        
  Similar Interests        
  1. Con completely missed the point of this argument. Israel may not have perfect racial laws, but they are significantly better than those of the surrounding Arab states, some of  whom still practice slavery and are ruled by oppressive theocracies with restricted human rights. My argument was that Israel's relatively similar interests to America mean that an alliance between the two countries could be a political influence on the Arab states. Even if Con can argue that Israel still has a few issues, he has to admit that they are *far* better than those of Jordan, Syria, Yemen Saudi Arabia, etc. I proved this in the last round by showing the lack of rights in each of these countries in contrast with Israel.         
  2. The fact that Israel isn't perfect strengthens my point about using the alliance as an influence on the Middle East. If Israel were to cut its influential connection with the U.S., its hope of abandoning its racial laws would be reduced. This country needs Western influence if there is any future for its religious laws.        
  3. Con's mentioning of me ""painting Palestine as an oppressive state"" is a red herring. It has very little to do with the resolution, and I'm not sure sure what Con is trying to prove by trying to promote it. Palestine is a tiny area, so the fact that my opponent acknowledged it and not the other nations is odd. Even so, Israel is regarded as free with high ratings in political and civil rights areas[1], while the Gaza Strip is ""not free"" with very low ratings in both areas[2].        
  Peace

34,"NON-LAWYER JUDGES Resolved, that non-lawyers should also serve as judges on courts because they will enhance the court's administration of justice. INTRODUCTION: For most trial courts of general jurisdiction and appellate courts, the constitutions and statutes establishing such courts provide that the judges shall be ""learned in the law"". Being ""learned in the law"" is currently defined or interpreted to mean graduation from an approved law school, passing a bar examination, and being formally admitted to the practice of law in the courts. Thus, judgeships are currently reserved exclusively for lawyers. 1 Some believe, however, that other non-lawyer scholars with a special interest in the law, such as some philosophers, historians, political scientists and others, are intellectually qualified to serve as judges. They also should be legally eligible to serve as judges. 1 <URL>... <URL>... (Art. V, Sec. 12 ) In Re Scarrella, 221 N.W.2d 563 (Minn. 1974) (Holding that ""learned in the law"" means admitted or entitled to be admitted as an attorney-at-law in the state) DEFINITIONS: enhance. 1. To make greater, as in value, beauty, or effectiveness; augment. 2. To provide with improved, advanced, or sophisticated features. <URL>... ASSUMPTIONS: Deliberative bodies perform their purposes better when they have an diverse membership. ARGUMENTS: (1.) The learning and perspective of a non-lawyer judge will enhance the jurisprudence of a court. In his prime, political science professor Walter Berns would have been an excellent appellate judge. 1 He could have clarified the Supreme Court's philosophy on capital punishment, especially, for example, regarding the rigid thought on capital punishment held by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. Brennan held absolutely that capital punishment was unconstitutional. 2 Berns criticized Brennan's absolutist position as obviously fallacious. He pointed out that the Founders explicitly considered the subject of capital punishment because the subject is mentioned in the Constitution. They could have prohibited capital punishment in all cases. They did not. 3 Berns' criticism is set forth in his excellent book, ""Taking the Constitution Seriously"", which I have read. 4 (2.) A non-lawyer scholar or judge can get a minimal competence in a new area of law through independent study. Some lawyers on Minnesota's Iron Range referred a husband and wife to me for the purpose of filing bankruptcy. However, the lawyers asked me to review the facts regarding legal malpractice law. They thought that the husband and wife might have a claim against their former lawyer. I knew nothing about the law on legal malpractice. I called the husband and wife and made an appointment. In the meantime, I obtained the leading treatise on legal malpractice to study before I met with them. 5 We subsequently sued, obtained a jury verdict, and successfully defended the verdict in the appellate courts. The final damage amount received was $160,000. The clients avoided filing bankruptcy by paying all their debts. 6 (3) Martha Nussbaum is indubitably qualified to serve as a Supreme Court Justice. Her credentials are extraordinary and outstanding. 7 _______________________________ 1. <URL>... ; <URL>... 2. ""Brennan was also less interested in stare decisis or the avoidance of ""absolutist"" positions where the death penalty was concerned. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled that the death penalty was constitutional four years later.

Resolved, that non-lawyers should also serve as judges on courts because they will enhance the court's administration of justice.  
  
INTRODUCTION:  
  
For most trial courts of general jurisdiction and appellate courts, the constitutions and statutes establishing such courts provide that the judges shall be ""learned in the law"". Being ""learned in the law"" is currently defined or interpreted to mean graduation from an approved law school, passing a bar examination, and being formally admitted to the practice of law in the courts. Thus, judgeships are currently reserved exclusively for lawyers. 1  
  
Some believe, however, that other non-lawyer scholars with a special interest in the law, such as some philosophers, historians, political scientists and others, are intellectually qualified to serve as judges. They also should be legally eligible to serve as judges.  
  
1   http://courts.state.ar.us...     http://sites.state.pa.us...   (Art. V, Sec. 12 ) In Re Scarrella, 221 N.W.2d 563 (Minn. 1974) (Holding that ""learned in the law"" means admitted or entitled to be admitted as an attorney-at-law in the state)  
  
DEFINITIONS:  
  
enhance. 1. To make greater, as in value, beauty, or effectiveness; augment. 2. To provide with improved, advanced, or sophisticated features.   http://www.thefreedictionary.com...  
  
ASSUMPTIONS:  
  
Deliberative bodies perform their purposes better when they have an diverse membership.  
  
ARGUMENTS:  
  
(1.) The learning and perspective of a non-lawyer judge will enhance the jurisprudence of a court.  
  
In his prime, political science professor Walter Berns would have been an excellent appellate judge. 1 He could have clarified the Supreme Court's philosophy on capital punishment, especially, for example, regarding the rigid thought on capital punishment held by Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.  
  
Brennan held absolutely that capital punishment was unconstitutional. 2 Berns criticized Brennan's absolutist position as obviously fallacious. He pointed out that the Founders explicitly considered the subject of capital punishment because the subject is mentioned in the Constitution. They could have prohibited capital punishment in all cases. They did not. 3 Berns' criticism is set forth in his excellent book, ""Taking the Constitution Seriously"", which I have read. 4  
  
(2.) A non-lawyer scholar or judge can get a minimal competence in a new area of law through independent study.  
  
Some lawyers on Minnesota's Iron Range referred a husband and wife to me for the purpose of filing bankruptcy. However, the lawyers asked me to review the facts regarding legal malpractice law. They thought that the husband and wife might have a claim against their former lawyer. I knew nothing about the law on legal malpractice.  
  
I called the husband and wife and made an appointment. In the meantime, I obtained the leading treatise on legal malpractice to study before I met with them. 5 We subsequently sued, obtained a jury verdict, and successfully defended the verdict in the appellate courts. The final damage amount received was $160,000. The clients avoided filing bankruptcy by paying all their debts. 6  
  
(3) Martha Nussbaum is indubitably qualified to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.  
  
Her credentials are extraordinary and outstanding. 7

2. ""Brennan was also less interested in stare decisis or the avoidance of ""absolutist"" positions where the death penalty was concerned. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall concluded in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional, and never accepted the legitimacy of Gregg v. Georgia, which ruled that the death penalty was constitutional four years later. Thereafter, Brennan or Marshall took turns, joined by the other, in issuing a dissent in every denial of certiorari in a capital case, and from every decision in a case which the court did take which failed to vacate a sentence of death.[13] ""   http://en.wikipedia.org...  .

  http://www.heritage.org...  ...  
  
In fact, much of the issues of stability are related to NATO leaving the country. Therefore, NATO presence increased stability in he country.  
""Afghanistan's security situation is likely to deteriorate if U.S. and other foreign forces withdraw""  
  http://www.cfr.org...  ...  
In order for elections to be ""free"", NATO forces must stay in the region in order to combat the Taliban, which has been working to subvert the election processes in Afghanistan. Therefore, if anything, NATO involvement should *increase*, not decrease, in order to maximize stability.  
  
Later when if they claim that Afghan security forces are harming the country, this notes how Afghani security forces have dramatically improved under NATO supervision and have ""performed adequately"".  
  http://www.longwarjournal.org...  ...  
  
""In southern Afghanistan, security has improved in Kandahar City and in the Arghandab River Valley to the west""  
Also security operations in the east of the country ""have decreased insurgent ability to refit and resupply for the coming summer fighting season"" (above link; long war journal)  
  
  C3: Better Infrastructure  
  
Before NATO involvement, most of Afghanistan had any modern infrastructure. In fact, most rural areas had absolutely zero infrastructure. US involvement alone has led to more people having access to clean water, electricity, an improved electrical grid, and 500 medical facilities. Including help from all of the nations put together, there are 600 medical facilities that have been created. The involvement has dramatically increased the well being of the average Afghanistan citizen. NATO is now working with the local government in order to maintain these improvements.  
  
""In 2002, only six percent of Afghans had access to reliable power; today, more than 28% do. . . . USAID has invested more than $2 billion on the construction and rehabilitation of more than 2,000 kilometers (km) of roads, including Afghanistan""s Ring Road, which connects the country""s five major cities . . . The Afghan government and USAID have constructed more than 3,000 wells, primarily in rural communities, to provide reliable clean water for the first time to more than 615,000 Afghans, and nearly 33,000 latrines help to prevent the spread of disease . . . USAID erected two high schools for 12,000 students in Kabul City and four provincial teacher-training centers in Faryab, Nangarhar, Parwan, and Wardak, and six faculties of higher education facilities in Bamyan, Parwan, Herat, Balkh, Jawzjan and Faryab.""

No matter what religion they believe in, most people agree that war has been around since the beginning of time. It has lead to nations being built, and has ended countless empires. Mankind has, and most likely always will use war. Many of these wars are the product of greed, in which countless lives cease to exist. These wars spread across planet earth like wildfire, destroying everything in its path. These wars are without a doubt, unpardonable. Though, this does not mean that all war is unjustified. Although most people do not want to admit it, there is such a thing as a necessary evil. Take the ""Trolly problem"" scenario: "" A trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you - your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?"" Or what about the ""Ticking Time bomb"" scenario: ""There is a terrorist in custody who has hid a bomb in New York City. The bomb is set to explode in thirty minutes and is going to kill thousands of innocent people. Would it be ok to torture the terrorist to get the location of the bombed out of him?"" When morals contradict morals, people tend to back away from the subject. But you can see what I am getting at here. Many people will come up with arguments of how it wouldn't be moral to push the fat man or torture the terrorist, but the facts are still there, it would be better to do so. The same could be said about war. Many people suffer at the hand of their government, take North Korea for example. The government keeps their people hidden in the dark, if you do not comply with their orders, you are either killed in a gruesome way, or thrown in an inhumane prison. North Korea has a concentration camp known only as ""Camp 22."" Camp 22 was established in 1959. As of today, there are an estimated 50,000 prisoners held in Camp 22. Most have been imprisoned because relatives were critical of the Korean Workers' Party or its General Secretary, Kim Jong-il. Analysis of satellite imagery suggests that the camp is surrounded by guarded fences. Housing is clustered in fairly small groups. Reasons for housing the prisoners in this fashion are unclear, but could be to decrease the risk of rebellion. There have even been accounts of chemical experimentation on prisoners using a glass gas chamber for observation. This is just one of many prisons in North Korea. So many people are suffering at the hand of this horrible government. Now, if there was a nation that wished to stand up for what is right and take down North Korea's evil government would it be wrong? Would it be wrong to kill some people in North Korea's army in order to save its civilians? Of course not! Now, what about revolutions? In 1775, thirteen British colonies rebelled against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The thirteen colonies decided that they wanted freedom from Great Britain's rule. They wanted to be free from the over priced tax, and they also wanted freedom of religion. Britain was being overbearing and cruel to the colonies. The colonies started the war with Britain and won. After the war, they claimed their independence and later became The United States of America. Surely you can agree that this war also is justified. If you for some odd reason disagree with the two examples above, surely you will not be able to tell yourself that the following example is unjustified. The example that I speak of is invasions of our territory. Let us say that the USA is tired of Canada's export tax on its yummy maple syrup and wants to take them over. So, they send over troops to take down their government. Canada, of course, fights back. By defending her homeland, Canada is starting a war. This war is of course justified. Would it be better just to surrender? No way! If that were the case, The United States of America could be taken over by Jamaica, Mexico, or North Korea! It is obvious that this would not work. On December 7th, 1941 353 Japanese air crafts attacked Pearl Harbor, the next day the USA entered World War Two. The Japanese accomplished exactly what they wanted to do, their goal was to bring the United States into the war. But, it was of course necessary for the USA to enter. It is easy to see that the USA had no other choice then to enter the war; therefore, entering World War Two was justified. Many people today want to feel like they are that someone to stand up against all the bloodshed. They want to come together and say 'enough is enough.'

And we the people have the duty to reject and condemn any law or policy that seeks to deny any American these essential rights. The Marriage Amendment or amendment 2 to the Florida constitution is a deceitful effort by conservative religious groups in the state of Florida to deny brilliant, artistic, caring, innovative, and friendly people the right to seek their happiness by denying them the most sacred form of expressing love to one another. I'm talking of course of these groups trying to deny homosexuals the right to marry in the state of Florida. Lets first start off by proving the advantages the LGBT community brings to a state.

Thank you, For your opening statements.  
As this first round is solely for opening arguments I shall refrain from refuting any of your statements yet, but thank you for the wealth of material to cover.  
  
1) Marriage under the state should be different to Marriage under the lord and the two cannot be equated like is what is colloquially happening  
Marriage has gone back a long way in terms of human history but it is generally considered that historically it has been the role of the church and ecclesiasts to marry couples. however, in recent times the state has deemed for its own reasons that this religious principle should become under the power of the state and have started handing out privileges to those whom are married.  
The state is ok as we have seen with marrying 2 individuals as you have pointed out and thus will give a gay couple similar rights as a straight couple and call it marriage. Now here is where we run into a problem because the Ecclesiastic Church doesn""t support Gay people and their lifestyle thus in their marriages it is only permitted between a man and a woman. hence the traditional white dress and church bells wedding imagery pops into our head. the people of the church have founded a belief system in which well it speaks for itself Leviticus 20:13: ""If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."" so what most people don""t find is the difference between a church marriage and a State one, one for god and what the couple believes in the other for the benefits of the state. here is where I propose a counter model instead of slandering these people""s belief systems we create a new equal right legal contract, oh wait we already have something similar a civil union so this is less a counter model more leave the status quo alone you are complaining about someone""s belief system being unequal and demanding. That, instead of doing what most people would do and leave people to believe what they wish, you would force them to change their culture and their beliefs to suit you.  
it is not moral to force your view upon others when they define a traditional historical ritual upon binding two people under the eyes of god a god who they have defined doesn't approve of lying man with man. so if it is not moral it most definatly shouldnt be legal  
  
2) The Child and their Young conditions  
Currently in society the Nuclear family is still the norm and anything that deviates from it will struggle a little more than others so is the nature of biology and the world. if we make gay marriage legal then all the family""s formed under this act will be against the norm and more often than not find it harder. now I am not saying that the nuclear family is perfect just that children need both a mother and a father and that without this it leaves them open to peers rejecting them from society at an early age and it also opens up problems by which as a toddler not all of the values that would normally be ensued by a mother figure (father figure) would be present as the child only gets 2 father figures in the home.  
  
3)minor point: this could be a slippery slope  
the legalization and acceptance of gay marriage allows for people to start putting into question other sexual orientations like that of incestuous origin. just take a look at some of the polls that have arisen in wake of this issue and see how they have used the generic arguments for gay equality to justify bestiality and paedophilia and incest. food for thought  
  
4)minor point: legalizing something means that it is blanket acceptance  
I somewhat touched on this in my first point but by legalizing this you are stating a blanket across all marriage licenses that they are accepting of this yet there was an outcry from mainly the people issuing the marriage licences and ordaining these marriages the people who were actually dealing with the problem at hand. their outcry has been hushed and by law they are being forced against their belief to default their churches and besmirch their marital ideals.

51,"The Federal Government (USFG)has no power to legalize the industrial use of hemp. My opponent claims that USFG has that power under the Incidental Powers provision of the Constitution. The Incidental Powers provision simply gives Congress power to introduce such legislation as is necessary for the proper exercise of the powers it expressely has under the Constitution.

53,"Thank you Pro for rounding off your debate. I will quickly run us all through what this debate has featured as its main points of contention. So there is the two points you brought to the table in your initial argument, Economic benefits and how natural homosexuality is, that I challenged and we continued from there. Then there were the points I brought to the table which you have not addressed in any great detail what so ever. Those points being my slippery slope argument, the argument against the family, the argument of separation of state marriages and church marriages. Starting on your points however, economically you have stated that with any economic benefit the government has a duty to peruse this benefit within reason. Here you have nearly the right the economic benefit and the cost for that benefit should go up by percentile, so for a negligible increase in economic benefit only a negligible cost or less can be accepted. The cost of passing this law is not negligible as shown by the controversy and unrest it has caused throughout society so justifying that due to economic benefits is deployable. Also I took another look through your resources to find out where these costs are being cut. And it""s through medical assistance funding. So by giving them their right to marry you also take funded health care in order to justify your economic benefit that is not just. You then question my use of the American deficit and as I stated when in my essay I am not blaming the increase on this law. I am merely putting into perspective these benefits you are basing your arguments off. My opponent then goes on to defend his sources stating, in a rather muddled fashion, that his bias news platform has referenced unbiased studies. However, you are still working off the information presented in a bias fashion so the numbers you are quoting are put there to push a narrative. That cannot stand and thus I have won the economic argument The other argument you brought forward which I refuted and then expanded upon was the idea of an innate characteristic. Now we both agree that being gay is a genetically defined characteristic fine but you say that because it defined like that it makes it 100% likely that they will turn out gay to which I told you that that isn""t biology so there is one flaw in your argument. Here is another, just because something is defined about your character doesn""t mean that you cannot be discriminated against for it I used the example of a psychopath who through his genetics was destined to become a psychopath. This is similar to the Gay argument because like we both agreed Gay people are ""destined"" to become such. So by dismissing my point because it is not ""appropriate"" is deplorable from the person who has been attacking not only my intelligence but using slander to personally attack my grammatical structures, so when voting please take consider this manipulation of the rules. So to finish this point on an imperial standpoint, when considering whether or not something needs to be written in law you must consider the morality and riotousness of what passing, or nullifying, a law will do. In this case more harm than good. Now the matter of the Church having no right to decide the law. Which yes is correct but vice versa the law has no power to supress the beliefs of the church. That is discriminating against a person""s beliefs which is something that I am assuming my opponent will admit is horrid. Under my model with two separate licenses one for the church a marriage under the lord and the other a union under the state this will get rid of all your discrimination arguments and sole the problems both sides of the table have put forward. My opponent then challenged my argument of the reason for marriage quoting the bible and a source that lead me to a Family Life page. Which yes was posted in the comments but I will still honour as I did similarly last round. You state using one specific quote that it claims god""s only purpose for marriage is love but that very website talks all about families and how marriage will grow a family that will grow your faith in the lord. I.E. the point of marriage by your own source is for creating a stable family. Finally, he states the main problem this moot brings forward that changing the law will require a change in position of the church. But it does people generally think of marriage as a thing that is ordained by a priest in a chapel not a slip of paper issues by the state. This is the Equivalence problem we face and why I tried to separate the two terms earlier. But as it stands it will force the church to change its standpoint. So it is plain to see that Gay Marriage should not be legalised as I have stated many times the cost of forcing people to change their beliefs is not outweighed by the economic benefits or the social benefits. instead we should follow a different course of action like I have stated from the beginning that we separate this gay union from marriage to fix the problem while not causing unnecessary social tensions.

55,"Thanks, Con. It seems my opponent has already argued against and subsequently defeated his own case. ""Despite highly extensive differences, people all have that common ground [credo] ... I advocate a world government which is strong, and prudently federalized, yet gentle, in that any country may opt out of it. If such and such a country does not like the law of the land, they're free to either leave the law or leave the land."" What Con has just described does not at all fit the criteria of a world government. The definition we have established is a single, unified government that everyone in the world is expected to abide by. If people can ""opt out"" of the government, then not everyone is following the same rules of order. Con pointed out that everyone despite their differences wants to establish laws, so by acknowledging that various communities will establish their own laws, he has repeated exactly what I said in the last round. I pointed out that various governments will inevitably form. Con agrees. As such, this dismantles the notion of a single and unified world government. What Con is describing is the peaceful coexistence of multiple governments, with perhaps a unified system of order that overrides (or should override) them all - say like an institution resembling the United Nations. In this organization, many governments are represented. While each country's power and influence over this organization is certainly not equal, it's naive and idealistic to assume that this would be the case in whatever utopia Con proposes. There will inevitably be a particular group who is more powerful or influential, and that will probably be based on wealth (resources) though there may be other factors. Regardless, the point here is that Con hasn't advocated for an actual world government. He's advocated for the allowance of various groups to form their own governments or opt out of the alleged ""world"" government. Con asks what would necessarily make a world government oppressive. If people could ""opt out"" of the government, then of course it wouldn't be oppressive. However, it also wouldn't be a world government! What this sounds like is a variation of anarcho-capitalism -- a system where property rights are acknowledged, but everyone is free to live their life according to their own values/laws within their given territory. Anarcho-capitalism supposes - as my opponent does - the right for people to govern themselves by opting into a system of governance that appeals to their values. On the contrary, a world government would be inherently oppressive because people would have no choice but to follow the singular law of the land. As I said in R2, a government's rules are usually upheld by law enforcement - the police or military. If there was only a singular legitimate authority with a monopoly on force (as a world government implies), then oppression is evident. However that is not what Con proposes.

  Thanks, Con.   It seems my opponent has already argued against and subsequently defeated his own case.   ""Despite highly extensive differences, people all have that common ground [credo] ... I advocate a world government which is strong, and prudently federalized, yet gentle, in that any country may opt out of it. If such and such a country does not like the law of the land, they're free to either leave the law or leave the land.""     What Con has just described does not at all fit the criteria of a world government. The definition we have established is a single, unified government that everyone in the world is expected to abide by. If people can ""opt out"" of the government, then not everyone is following the same rules of order. Con pointed out that everyone despite their differences wants to establish laws, so by acknowledging that various communities will establish their own laws, he has repeated exactly what I said in the last round. I pointed out that various governments will inevitably form. Con agrees. As such, this dismantles the notion of a single and unified world government.   What Con is describing is the peaceful coexistence of multiple governments, with perhaps a unified system of order that overrides (or should override) them all - say like an institution resembling the United Nations. In this organization, many governments are represented. While each country's power and influence over this organization is certainly not equal, it's naive and idealistic to assume that this would be the case in whatever utopia Con proposes. There will inevitably be a particular group who is more powerful or influential, and that will probably be based on wealth (resources) though there may be other factors. Regardless, the point here is that Con hasn't advocated for an actual world government. He's advocated for the allowance of various groups to form their own governments or opt out of the alleged ""world"" government.   Con asks what would necessarily make a world government oppressive. If people could ""opt out"" of the government, then of course it wouldn't be oppressive. However, it also wouldn't be a world government! What this sounds like is a variation of anarcho-capitalism -- a system where property rights are acknowledged, but everyone is free to live their life according to their own values/laws within their given territory. Anarcho-capitalism supposes - as my opponent does - the right for people to govern themselves by opting into a system of governance that appeals to their values. On the contrary, a world government would be inherently oppressive because people would have no choice but to follow the singular law of the land. As I said in R2, a government's rules are usually upheld by law enforcement - the police or military. If there was only a singular legitimate authority with a monopoly on force (as a world government implies), then oppression is evident. However that is not what Con proposes.   To be sure that my supposition of what qualifies as a world government isn't off base, I'll refer to Wikipedia's definition and my opponent can feel free to challenge it. He can and perhaps should go into more detail about what this government should entail in the next round. After all, saying it should be ""strong yet gentle"" is still completely vague and ambiguous.

Even though though people do have to go through that, the point is that you are still expecting me to be okay with killing an innocent life 2.Like I stated earlier there is a risk but not a high one. I also stated there wouldn't be any risks if both partners just decide to not have sex in the first place. If you want to have sex do it for a child and if you're not be aware of the risks, but that doesn't mean that if the condom broke that someone else should suffer because of it. You're killing the baby primarily for yourself and that's a selfish act. Also if someone was impregnated with a condom and birth control, how long ago was this? She could have not taken it in a while, he could have had the wrong size condom or both or she lied for attention. 3. You just said we kill animals for food and our convince, a lot similar to abortion huh? Also comparing humans with animals is not correct. That's why there is a law that makes it possible for farmers to kill animals and for humans to kill other humans. 4. Again that's $300,000 dollars over 18 years, that's a long time. Also if you don't want the kid put them up for adoption. It is true adoption is more expensive than abortion but not by much. Ranging for $200-$1000 5. Read point number 4 6. Well if the mother has cancer or any other diseases she shouldn't have sex and should know the risks it comes with. Also the chance of dying while giving birth is less than 1% in america, specially if the mother has matured. 7.

Are you willing to add a law that calls for the murder of babies because less than 1% were raped. Obviously I'm not blaming the ones who got raped, of course not, but they should consider adoption. If they're life is in danger and she might die from giving birth, then I guess in extreme cases like these abortion should be an option. In a situation like this either the mother or the baby will end up dying, and I'm sure you'll agree with me it is more important to save the mother, but remember my point, less 1% of abortions are because of rape and less 1% of births end up in a death. Responses to your extra arguments 1. Actually no, the fetus can feel pain as early as 8 weeks and if younger(most abortions happen with a suctions that rips the baby to pieces) the fetus will sense the suction and danger and will move around attempting to escape. 2. Read the end of point 7 3.Not an abortion issue but I'll discuss it. Rape is bad, period, and I think we need to make everyone know that they're never at fault and should always tell, but if they don't tell, how are we to know. Also, I personally think in most cases of rape, the rapist should be given the death penalty, this will probably lower rape numbers, probably I'm no expert. Again if an eleven year old girl was raped AND got pregnant (not very likely) I do believe abortion should be an option if her life is in danger. If adoption is possible and there is no financial or medical issues then I think she should take that route. 4.Not much to say here 5.

65,"My opponent's definition of vigilantism comes from the American University of Law System. My definition, on the other hand, (The act of a citizen who takes the law into his or her own hands by apprehending and punishing suspected criminals.) comes from the Black's Law Dictionary.""Black's Law Dictionary is the definitive legal resource for lawyers, law students and laypeople alike. Edited by the world's foremost legal lexicographer, Bryan A. Garner, Black's Law Dictionary is known for its clear and precise legal definitions, substantive accuracy, and stylistic clarity -- making it the most cited legal dictionary in print."" (blacklawdictionary.com) My opponent claims that by limiting the debate to the United States it is easier to relate to. But, in this debate we must prove that vigilantism is or is not justified when the government has failed to enforce the law as a general rule. We cannot conditionally make vigilantism unjustified only in the United States: the resolution asks us to decide if vigilantism is justified when the government has failed to enforce the law overall. Therefore my definition of government (the political direction and control exercised over the actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities, societies, and states) better addresses the resolution. My opponent responds to my attack on his first contention by saying that by limiting the debate to the US the US law is at hand. There are two problems with this: 1) The debate should not be limited to the US (as explained above) 2) The resolution asks us if vigilantism is justified when the government fails to enforce the law. Essentially this means that no law is existing because a law not enforced is a law that is virtually nonexistent. So the US or international law becomes void. My opponent responds to my attack on his third contention by claiming that the death penalty would occur only when there was no doubt that the offender was guilty. However wrongful convictions can and will occur in the ""imperfect democracy"" that my opponent wants, so people can be convicted wrongly. He then addresses the founding fathers. I never claimed that the founding fathers were vigilantes; I said that the colonists were vigilantes. Furthermore he claims that ""vigilantes avenge unpunished crimes, not unchecked criminal regimes."" However the crime was committed BY the regime BECAUSE they did not enforce the law. So basically they avenge criminal regimes. My opponent then responds to my attack on his fifth contention by saying that we have the duty from protecting that person by subduing them and holding them. However what happens if the rapist (or murderer, etc.) has a weapon? Holding them down won't do much good: they would simply use said weapon. He then claims that my second contention is untopical through his definition of government. As discussed above my definition of government is better since it addresses the entire world as opposed to a single country. Thus you can drop his attack on my second contention. My opponent then attacks my value criterion, citing that it eventually comes down to who decides to what is justice. But, isn't that what happens present-day in the courts: the judge ultimately decides if the offender is guilty? And who votes these judges in? The people. So, essentially, the people shave the right to decide what is justice in either case, which is exactly what vigilantism is. He then supports his VC by claiming that we are protecting the rights of everyone. Really? Is that even happening now? Previously, my opponent claimed that these rights included cruel and unusual punishment. Isn't that happening now, in many cases throughout the world (Guantanamo, etc.)?

My opponent's definition of vigilantism comes from the American University of Law System. My definition, on the other hand, (The act of a citizen who takes the law into his or her own hands by apprehending and punishing suspected criminals.) comes from the Black's Law Dictionary.""Black's Law Dictionary is the definitive legal resource for lawyers, law students and laypeople alike. Edited by the world's foremost legal lexicographer, Bryan A. Garner, Black's Law Dictionary is known for its clear and precise legal definitions, substantive accuracy, and stylistic clarity — making it the most cited legal dictionary in print."" (blacklawdictionary.com)  
  
My opponent claims that by limiting the debate to the United States it is easier to relate to. But, in this debate we must prove that vigilantism is or is not justified when the government has failed to enforce the law as a general rule. We cannot conditionally make vigilantism unjustified only in the United States: the resolution asks us to decide if vigilantism is justified when the government has failed to enforce the law overall. Therefore my definition of government (the political direction and control exercised over the actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities, societies, and states) better addresses the resolution.  
  
My opponent responds to my attack on his first contention by saying that by limiting the debate to the US the US law is at hand. There are two problems with this:  
1) The debate should not be limited to the US (as explained above)  
2) The resolution asks us if vigilantism is justified when the government fails to enforce the law. Essentially this means that no law is existing because a law not enforced is a law that is virtually nonexistent. So the US or international law becomes void.  
  
My opponent responds to my attack on his third contention by claiming that the death penalty would occur only when there was no doubt that the offender was guilty. However wrongful convictions can and will occur in the ""imperfect democracy"" that my opponent wants, so people can be convicted wrongly.  
  
He then addresses the founding fathers. I never claimed that the founding fathers were vigilantes; I said that the colonists were vigilantes. Furthermore he claims that ""vigilantes avenge unpunished crimes, not unchecked criminal regimes."" However the crime was committed BY the regime BECAUSE they did not enforce the law. So basically they avenge criminal regimes.  
  
My opponent then responds to my attack on his fifth contention by saying that we have the duty from protecting that person by subduing them and holding them. However what happens if the rapist (or murderer, etc.) has a weapon? Holding them down won't do much good: they would simply use said weapon.  
  
He then claims that my second contention is untopical through his definition of government. As discussed above my definition of government is better since it addresses the entire world as opposed to a single country. Thus you can drop his attack on my second contention.  
  
My opponent then attacks my value criterion, citing that it eventually comes down to who decides to what is justice. But, isn't that what happens present-day in the courts: the judge ultimately decides if the offender is guilty? And who votes these judges in? The people. So, essentially, the people shave the right to decide what is justice in either case, which is exactly what vigilantism is.  
  
He then supports his VC by claiming that we are protecting the rights of everyone. Really? Is that even happening now? Previously, my opponent claimed that these rights included cruel and unusual punishment. Isn't that happening now, in many cases throughout the world (Guantanamo, etc.)? Therefore you should accept my VC over my opponent's.

73,"[Thank you for accepting this debate] Rebuttal: I disagree with my opponent's definition of vigilantism. His definition states that a person violates the law to ensure justice when they think that the criminal will not be be caught. However, it is not necessary for one to break the law to ensure justice: for example, if one steals food from a grocery store, and another stops him, then the second person is not breaking the law, but is still acting as a vigilante to ensure justice in the society. I disagree with my opponent's definition of government. He states that the government refers to the United States. However, because the US is not stated in the actual resolution, government cannot mean only the United States government. My value is the same as my opponent's, so I have no argument. My opponent's value criterion is protecting rights. He cites that vigilantism offers no protection of various governmental rights. What he fails to note is that when the government has failed to enforce the law, the government is null and void, because the government does not do its job of protecting its citizens. If the government is null then so are the rights it ""guarantees"". My opponent's first contention claims that the law itself might be unjust or even criminal under international law. He cites the Fugitive Slave Act and the Jim Crow laws. However, no international organization was existing when these laws were being implemented, so no international law existed. My opponent's second contention claims that vigilantism leads to anarchy. He cites that an imperfect democracy is the best form of government. However, a democracy is run by the people. Vigilantes are also people, so won't they have input in the democracy? So, under my opponent's contention, if vigilantes are really criminals, then criminals would be running the democracy. So if this occurred wouldn't the best form of government would be republicanism, where leaders are elected by popular vote. Criminals make up for a small minority of the population so their votes would not really be existent. My opponent's third contention claims that vigilantism is unjust. He admits that the law can go wrong, but only after being found guilty by a jury. However, remember that vigilantes would only act as a last resort because of a failure of the established law system. So only if the government wasn't willing to convict a murderer in which there was clear evidence of the crime would vigilantes act. My opponent's fourth contention claims that vigilantism interferes with constitutional rights. He cites the Sixth Amendment, stating that an impartial jury should be reviewing the case. Again, remember that vigilantes would only act as a last resort because of a failure of the established law system. Only if this system did not work would vigilantes take place. My opponent's fifth contention is an attack on my case, claiming that my examples are untopical. He states that we ""are only allowed to use as much force that's required to stop the attacker"". The question then becomes how much force is required. If one is intent on raping someone, for example, then I am sure that telling the rapist ""Don't do that, that's against the law"" won't do much. Rather, what one must do is not chainsaw the attacker, but ensure justice occurs in a meaningful way. My opponent's sixth contention claims that the government may be strapped for resources. However, I don't exactly understand where my opponent is heading with this. Doesn't this support my side: the government is unable to enforce the law because of lack of money, and so it is upon the citizens to ensure justice in the society. If my opponent could elaborate on this contention that would be helpful. My opponent's conclusion is cut off, so I don't have any comment. I await my opponent's response.

They kill most of their animals, and even the PETA manager admitted this. Public records prove that in 2009 PETA, killed 97.3% of the animals received. I see that you are basing your argument off of what PETA claims. PETA is nothing more than a group of people making money reporting false cases. PETA rakes in nearly $30 million each year in income, much of it raised from pet owners who think their donations actually help animals. Instead, the group spends huge sums on programs equating people who eat chicken. [2] PETA lures people in by making false reports in order to get money. So after all this, do you think we should believe them on how KFC treats its chickens? You claim that Debate.org members are not just ordinary people, that they have the ability to persuade people in joining them. This is true to an extent, most people who sign up for this website never even get past ten debates. If all 17,756 were as good a debater as the members on the leader board, then KFC would have a problem. But they are not. There are only about 200 members who can actually debate on this site. Another thing to consider, there are others out there who are just as good debaters that would support KFC. Since KFC is in fact a better choice than many other fast food restaurants, they would have more facts to argue with. Nothing matters without the facts. You say that there are many other ethical alternatives to KFC. While this is true, there would still be a loss of pleasure. No one can find the secret recipe, therefore some people will never be able to eat yummy KFC chicken again! KFC is known for its secrete recipe. For years, Colonel Harland Sanders carried the secret formula for his Kentucky Fried Chicken in his head and the spice mixture in his car. Today, the recipe is locked away in a safe in Louisville, Kentucky. Only a handful of people know that multi-million dollar recipe, and each is obligated to strict confidentiality by contract. The Colonel developed the formula back in the 1930s when he operated the Sanders Court & Cafe restaurant and motel in Corbin, Kentucky. There, his blend of 11 herbs and spices first developed a loyal following of customers. [3] You say that people could simply visit Britain to get their KFC. Many people on debate.org cannot afford to fly out to Britain to get their chicken. Anyway, how do you know that all the birds over there are treated right? PETA has simply not targeted them yet. What I said about KFC being healthy does indeed apply to this debate. Like I said before, why should we boycott something that is better than the rest? We need to focus on getting other restaurants to follow KFC. If we buy at KFC, other restaurants will see that they need to change the way they prepare meat to get more customers. But if we boycott KFC, other restaurants will not have to worry about ""health competition."" You say that it would be okay if KFC simply closed because other restaurants would simply open up. This goes along with the point I listed right above. Other restaurants would have no need to be healthy if their competition was gone. You then say that other restaurants would simply open up other restaurants and all the KFC employees would be okay. This would not be the case however. Many other people are unemployed already and looking for work, only a select few would get a job if any spots were open. Also, people are not opening new shops in today's economy. Less and less people are eating out, so place like McDonalds and Wendy's would most likely leave their stores the way it is. Therefore, more unemployed. In the end, there would be way more Cons then Pros in closing down KFC. So why should debate.org members boycott it? Like I said before, if they were going to boycott anything why not McDonalds? They have frozen unhealthy fatty foods that are hurting Americans.KFC is McDonalds biggest enemy. Why would we want to give McDonalds total control? For this reason, I heavily urge a CON vote.

For years, Colonel Harland Sanders carried the secret formula for his Kentucky Fried Chicken in his head and the spice mixture in his car. Today, the recipe is locked away in a safe in Louisville, Kentucky. Only a handful of people know that multi-million dollar recipe, and each is obligated to strict confidentiality by contract.  
  
The Colonel developed the formula back in the 1930s when he operated the Sanders Court & Cafe restaurant and motel in Corbin, Kentucky. There, his blend of 11 herbs and spices first developed a loyal following of customers. [3]  
  
You say that people could simply visit Britain to get their KFC. Many people on debate.org cannot afford to fly out to Britain to get their chicken. Anyway, how do you know that all the birds over there are treated right? PETA has simply not targeted them yet.  
  
What I said about KFC being healthy does indeed apply to this debate. Like I said before, why should we boycott something that is better than the rest? We need to focus on getting other restaurants to follow KFC. If we buy at KFC, other restaurants will see that they need to change the way they prepare meat to get more customers. But if we boycott KFC, other restaurants will not have to worry about ""health competition.""  
  
You say that it would be okay if KFC simply closed because other restaurants would simply open up. This goes along with the point I listed right above. Other restaurants would have no need to be healthy if their competition was gone. You then say that other restaurants would simply open up other restaurants and all the KFC employees would be okay. This would not be the case however. Many other people are unemployed already and looking for work, only a select few would get a job if any spots were open. Also, people are not opening new shops in today's economy. Less and less people are eating out, so place like McDonalds and Wendy's would most likely leave their stores the way it is. Therefore, more unemployed.  
In the end, there would be way more Cons then Pros in closing down KFC. So why should debate.org members boycott it? Like I said before, if they were going to boycott anything why not McDonalds? They have frozen unhealthy fatty foods that are hurting Americans.KFC is McDonalds biggest enemy. Why would we want to give McDonalds total control? For this reason, I heavily urge a CON vote.  
  
I thank my opponent for this very fun debate. He had many good points that I enjoyed.  
I would also like to thank the audience for reading.

I want to address your issues with the attitude towards your example of the illegal immigrant bagger who doesn't speak english. The issues you claim are separate, are actually linked. The ILLEGAL immigrant bagger is the target of frustration because he is an ILLEGAL immigrant. That is exactly what I am talking about, you insinuated that I am a racist cause I want Americans working in America! I will be annoyed if the guy bagging my groceries, or washing my car, or serving my food, didn't speak english. But you automatically assume that it is influenced by racism, why, because I am white. Which further proves my point. Why can't I be annoyed because he is here illegally? Because he isn't white, so liberals say I have to like him! And to say that illegal immigration only affects the border states is just show how ill-informed you are. It affects the whole nation negatively and to say otherwise is just ignorance. We lose several billions a year to them, yet liberals praise them at every turn. Crank out spanish news papers, form all spanish speaking communities, slowly but surely make Americans conform to a bunch of criminals here illegally, and call any who oppose them racist! Typical liberal tactic. See, you guys do that, you put it on TV, then you look like civil rights activists when all you really are, are traitors to your own Nation. But most of television is Liberal. So MTV will put a bunch of illegals on TV being arrested by white cops, call it racist and unjust, and liberals are heroes. That is why minorities look down on conservatives, not because of their policies, but because the liberal media has made the stereotype of a white man to be a racist and a bigot. I just want to point out that white people can be discriminated against by other white people. Discrimination is discrimination. You didn't win this debate. I think it is hilarious you will sit here and claim civil rights as a liberal act yet it is liberals that keep driving a wedge between the races! Hate crime laws, affirmative action, scholarships for certain non-white races not based on merit but just race, then there is the liberal shield of racism used against conservatives. Why don't you guys just wrap all the minorities in bubble wrap so the big, bad, white man can't get them. It is funny/sad, that you can sit there and prove my point. White people are generalized as racist if they don't agree with the liberal agenda. Saying that liberals are looked at as the saviors by minorities doesn't mean that my point isn't valid. Name a person more discriminated than the straight white male, you have yet to do that. To claim that Bill Clinton is the ideal political candidate is more scary than funny. He is immoral, a criminal, a draft dodger, and a liar. I guess he is a great liberal candidate. By the by, giving tax cuts to the rich is probably the best thing you can do for the economy. I don't know many people making 20,000 a year that are employers. Tax cuts for the rich result in lower prices, higher wages, and more jobs. Reaganomics. Clinton was a par president and a sub-par person at best. Why do you think white males are joining all-white gangs in record numbers? It isn't because of their hate for other races. It is because of racial discrimination towards them. They feel that equal rights aren't equal. They feel they are looked down on because of who they are. A white male is 85% more likely to be convicted of a hate crime than a minority. Yet a white male is more 70% more likely to be attacked by a minority than by a white person. Ok, let me close with this. I think I have given many points that give credit to my stance on this issue. The white males in America are considered racist, immoral, and money grubbing. It is assumed that if your white, you are rich and privileged. This is judging a person by the color of their skin, which is discrimination. Taking the white man's identity and portraying it to be evil unless they agree with you is discrimination. I refuse to live in fear of being called racist just because I don't agree with liberal ideals. I oppose illegal immigration, hate crimes, and affirmative action. If you think those are beliefs of a racist person, than I state that they are beliefs of a person who wants EQUAL rights for all Americans with no exceptions.",1,ericjpomeroy,"

""In America where all policemen are armed, the rates of shot policemen are, needless to say, staggeringly higher, even on per capita terms."" We have hundreds of years of Evidence to show that gun ownership was not a problem (or the restriction) until the past few decades. Does it mean we are now wrong? What has changed? The access to guns? No, in fact it is getting harder by the day to purchase guns and ammunition. Yet, we still have these (unfortunate) mass murders and gun homicides. So whats the problem? You say we need very strict control and licenses (which to a point we already are required to have). Here is were i will introduce some factual evidence to where it is clear stricter laws do not mean increase safety and security: Myth: Countries with strict gun control have less crime ""Fact: Countries with the strictest gun-control laws also tended to have the highest homicide rates. 1"" ""Fact: According to the U.N., as of 2005, Scotland was the most violent country in the developed world, with people three times more likely to be assaulted than in America. Violent crime there has doubled over the last 20 years. 3% of Scots had been victims of assault compared with 1.2% in America. 2"" ""Fact: Switzerland has relatively lenient gun control for Europe 5, and has the third-lowest homicide rate of the top nine major European countries, and the same per capita rate as England and Wales."" ""Fact: ""We don""t have as many guns [in Brazil] as the United States, but we use them more."" 8 Brazil has mandatory licensing, registration, and maximum personal ownership quotas. It now bans any new sales to private citizens. Their homicide rate is almost three (3) times higher than the U.S"" There are countless more facts that support my claim and disagree with yours. (Link below). <URL>... ""There is a considerable number of children who pick up guns that their irresponsible (how strict are these regulations?) parents of or siblings have left lying around and have caused damage to themselves or others."" Adults and children can illegally obtain a lot of things here within the US. Look at the US on the war of drugs. Theres an arrest almost every 40 seconds due to illegal drugs. Restriction/removal is not the right move, if it was the case.... we wouldn't see an arrest every 40 seconds due to illegal drugs. Some kids take their parents cars without their permission and cause damage/death, should we ban vehicles as well? Instances like this can be carried on through a dramatically long list. ""I believe that it's all to easy to pull a trigger."" However, it takes a special type of person to pull it. ""It's impersonal and it doesn't require much thought."" Neither does drunk driving. ""IIf the possession of guns without license was criminalised in the United States, the number of innocent people who would not die every year as a result of negligence annually would no doubt be profound. If you take everyone's guns away, no one would need protection from them."" ""Fact: In Canada around 1920, before there was any form of gun control, their homicide rate was 7% of the U.S rate. By 1986, and after significant gun control legislation, Canada""s homicide rate was 35% of the U.S. rate "" a significant increase. 10 In 2003, Canada had a violent crime rate more than double that of the U.S. (963 vs. 475 per 100,000)"". ""Fact: Ironically, firearm use in crimes in the UK has doubled in the decade since handguns were banned"" <URL>... ""You say that it's been written in your constitution for hundreds of years, but as I recall slavery was also considered a moral practice by the founding fathers as well."" Almost all countries had slaves at one point, including yours. The American Constitution was framed after the European Enlightenment and we are still fine tuning ethical and moral dilemmas. The bottom line is that we have Natural born rights as a citizen, the right to bear arms is one of them. Do we live in a serious (choice of word)ed up society, seems like it at times. However, as i hopefully pointed out, further restriction would not eliminate the violence that we see today. Our problem rests much deeper that just the ""simple""restriction of guns, my friend.",1,Ubermensch-Tsoa,"
  
I lived in Europe for a little bit and had the opportunity to visit (and drink) with your country men, i enjoyed my stay!  
  
""In America where all policemen are armed, the rates of shot policemen are, needless to say, staggeringly higher, even on per capita terms.""  
We have hundreds of years of Evidence to show that gun ownership was not a problem (or the restriction) until the past few decades. Does it mean we are now wrong? What has changed? The access to guns? No, in fact it is getting harder by the day to purchase guns and ammunition. Yet, we still have these (unfortunate) mass murders and gun homicides.  
  
So whats the problem? You say we need very strict control and licenses (which to a point we already are required to have).  
Here is were i will introduce some factual evidence to where it is clear stricter laws do not mean increase safety and security:  
  
Myth: Countries with strict gun control have less crime  
  
""Fact: Countries with the strictest gun-control laws also tended to have the highest homicide rates. 1""  
  
""Fact: According to the U.N., as of 2005, Scotland was the most violent country in the developed world, with people three times more likely to be assaulted than in America. Violent crime there has doubled over the last 20 years. 3% of Scots had been victims of assault compared with 1.2% in America. 2""  
  
""Fact: Switzerland has relatively lenient gun control for Europe 5, and has the third-lowest homicide rate of the top nine major European countries, and the same per capita rate as England and Wales.""  
  
""Fact: ""We don""t have as many guns [in Brazil] as the United States, but we use them more."" 8 Brazil has mandatory licensing, registration, and maximum personal ownership quotas. It now bans any new sales to private citizens. Their homicide rate is almost three (3) times higher than the U.S""  
  
There are countless more facts that support my claim and disagree with yours. (Link below).  
  http://www.gunfacts.info...  
  
""There is a considerable number of children who pick up guns that their irresponsible (how strict are these regulations?) parents of or siblings have left lying around and have caused damage to themselves or others.""  
  
Adults and children can illegally obtain a lot of things here within the US. Look at the US on the war of drugs. Theres an arrest almost every 40 seconds due to illegal drugs. Restriction/removal is not the right move, if it was the case.... we wouldn't see an arrest every 40 seconds due to illegal drugs.  
  
Some kids take their parents cars without their permission and cause damage/death, should we ban vehicles as well?  
Instances like this can be carried on through a dramatically long list.  
  
""I believe that it's all to easy to pull a trigger."" However, it takes a special type of person to pull it.  
""It's impersonal and it doesn't require much thought."" Neither does drunk driving.  
""IIf the possession of guns without license was criminalised in the United States, the number of innocent people who would not die every year as a result of negligence annually would no doubt be profound. If you take everyone's guns away, no one would need protection from them.""  
  
""Fact: In Canada around 1920, before there was any form of gun control, their homicide rate was 7% of the U.S rate. By 1986, and after significant gun control legislation, Canada""s homicide rate was 35% of the U.S. rate "" a significant increase. 10 In 2003, Canada had a violent crime rate more than double that of the U.S. (963 vs. 475 per 100,000)"".  
  
""Fact: Ironically, firearm use in crimes in the UK has doubled in the decade since handguns were banned""  
  
  http://www.gunfacts.info...  
  
""You say that it's been written in your constitution for hundreds of years, but as I recall slavery was also considered a moral practice by the founding fathers as well."" Almost all countries had slaves at one point, including yours. The American Constitution was framed after the European Enlightenment and we are still fine tuning ethical and moral dilemmas. The bottom line is that we have Natural born rights as a citizen, the right to bear arms is one of them. Do we live in a serious (choice of word)ed up society, seems like it at times.

85,"First, I'm going to contest my opponent's counter-analysis of the word teach. They assert that in order to meet the full definition of the word, we have to 'Impart knowledge of *OR* skill in ; give instruction in'. They go on to CHANGE the definition to 'To impart knowledge of *AND* skill in ; give instruction in'. I CAN select which one in this sense that teach is referring to, as it says OR, not AND. As far as to give instruction in, yes. We are educating what creationism is. We teach them how to analyze the idea, in order to better understand past societies. Again, I do NOT have to meet the idea of teaching a skill. This is an OR definition ; my opponent should have provided a better definition if they didn't want to play by this one. On to my opponents rebuttals -Contention 1- My opponent says that it must be taught as FACT. Is that why we teach philosophies in psychology as fact? Or political views as fact? Or religious studies as fact? The answer is NO. This is just a false assertion. My opponent further says that if I think it's important to teach creationism, shouldn't I also be concerned with teaching the world was flat? Because arguing for the teaching in a historical sense of people thinking the world is flat is ATOPICAL. This is IRRELEVANT to the current debate and should be ignored. Further, he says there's evidence against it. That's GOOD. This supports the idea that not everyone in history has had ideas that were RIGHT. We still teach that medicine men would bleed out the sick in order to remove tainted blood. This is FACT. The part that is WRONG is that tainted blood isn't the cause of all illness, and bleeding out doesn't assist in this. In addition, he talks about holocaust denial as a theory, and etc. These are no where near as relevant as something that existed and was vital to society for THOUSANDS OF YEARS. He also mentions the geocentric theory ; We do teach about it. High school teachers teach about Copernicus and Galileo. Geocentric Theory is TAUGHT in order to provide for better comprehension. We provide their reasons because it assists in knowledge ; SCHOOLS NEED NOT ASSERT IT AS FACT. ONLY THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED FACT. -Contention 2- My opponent basically claims that it's atypical. This is wrong. Because we can use past examples of BAD EVIDENCE or LACK OF EVIDENCE, it helps form a more modern way of thinking. Yes, a lot of people in this world DO hold creationist beliefs today ; I'm not debating to protect peoples' feelings. I'm here to present the facts and reasons. This contention stands as other than making a false assertion of atopicality, he only goes on to say that it has nothing to do with the scientific method ; okay? It still serves as an EXAMPLE of BAD EVIDENCE OR LACK OF EVIDENCE being used to ASSERT something as FACT. On to my opponent's case 1 Creationism vs Evolution My opponent asserts that this is contention is basic. Because he provides NOTHING to argue against, I'll use what I'm assuming is his argument. He automatically assumes that we can only teach ONE or THE OTHER. We can teach one for better understand, ie, creationism, and the other as fact, ie, evolution. These are powerful tools when used TOGETHER, in teaching both SCIENCE and HISTORY. This argument falls ; Schools need not teach one or the other ; it's best to teach BOTH in PROPER CONTEXT. 2. Separation of Church and State My opponent basically is arguing against teaching creationism because there's so many types of creationism from different cultures. This is IRRELEVANT. When talking about Europe in history, we refer to CATHOLICISM and PROTESTANTISM, because these were CULTURALLY RELEVANT of the time. As far as for a science perspective, my opponent once again ASSERTS we must PICK which CREATION STORY we teach. This is, again, false. We can teach the IDEA OF CREATIONISM without teaching the STORIES OF IT. We can teach it as it has been shown throughout history. Basically, the easiest way to destroy this argument is to ACKNOWLEDGE that we do NOT need to teach it as FACT. This EDUCATION of creationism doesn't infringe on separation of church and state ; It's necessary to be taught in history classes to understand historic actions, from the crusaders, the the witch hunt trials, to the Spanish Inquisition. These are VITAL to understand the reasons of the culture. Again, we are NOT arguing that this is teaching it as FACT. Only imparting someone with knowledge. I've shown that this knowledge is demanded to understand history, and is supplementary to understanding the scientific method. He asserts that in order to have a viable field for academia, religious doctrine must stay out ; I've shown that the OPPOSITE is true.

90,"P1: I do agree that legalization of drugs would likely cause increased drug use. But a small increase at most--not a massive influx of new users. Take Portugal, for example. My opponent claims that, ""If drugs are made legal, a new influx of users would be created as people would no longer fear punishment for using drugs."" But the empirical evidence from Portugal's decriminalization of drugs contradicts this. It wasn't the same thing as legalization--producing and trafficking drugs is still illegal--but drug use is no longer punished as a crime. Portuguese drug users ""no longer fear punishment for using drugs."" If my opponent were correct, drug use would increase significantly. But that isn't what happened. Hard drug use stayed approximately the same or decreased overall, and all drug use decreased among youth. [1] Legalization is different from decriminalization, and would likely have somewhat different effects--but my opponent's claim that a lack of punishment for drug use would cause a significant influx of new users is false. P2: As there would be no massive influx of new drug users, this point is irrelevant. In addition, many of the health problems associated with drug use are the result of their illegality, not the drugs themselves. When Portugal decriminalized drugs, drug-related deaths and overdoses decreased dramatically, as did the rate of infections of HIV and other STDs. [1] Legalization would also eliminate health problems associated with drug impurities. Heroin use alone, for example, causes no serious health problems--health problems associated with heroin use are actually because of heroin prohibition, which causes impurities in the drug, and the use of dirty, infected needles. [2] P3: The problem with Con's evidence that drug use hurts workforce productivity is that it fails to take into account other variables. Once those are taken into account, the evidence paints an entirely different picture. Studies have found that illicit drug users actually receive higher wages than non-users. [3] [4] Other studies have found that illicit drug users generally have equally good or better productivity and absentee rates, and equally high or lower health-care costs. [5] [6] [7] Gangs: Con claims that using my logic, we would should also legalize rape and murder. This is false. My logic is that the harm caused by drug prohibition greatly exceeds the harm that a legal market in drugs would cause. That logic could not be applied to legalization of rape or murder, since legalization of those things would obviously cause much greater harm than their continued prohibition. My point stands. Police: Con claims that the abuse of power by police enforcing drug laws has to do with the police themselves, not the laws. This is partially true--there will always be corrupt police--but the drug laws themselves are responsible for a significant amount of the abuse and corruption. The difference between drug laws and laws against things like murder and rape is that murderers leave bodies and rapists leave rape victims. Thieves have stolen stuff. Such people can be found, prosecuted, and convicted without laws that violate the rights of innocent people, because they leave victims and evidence of their crimes. Drug users do not leave victims; they only victimize themselves. Police-state tactics are necessary to fight the drug war because that's the only way the government can find enough evidence to convict people. The asset-forfeiture laws used in my previous anecdote are an example of this. Asset forfeiture laws were considered clearly a violation of individual rights for much of America's history, but that changed during alcohol prohibition. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

  This being said, Pro has not refuted my point about the thought process of a pro-lifer, so that point still stands.   
     
  I look forward to Pro's response.

First my opponent fails to meet the burden I place on him which is that unless gay marriage harms other peoples rights then limitation or removal is not warranted. His only argument trying to address this was that the gay community heavily uses drugs, which I pointed out in my previous post that this his data was unreliable because of the high crime rate in the city where it was taken. Also I prove that this has no impact on whether gay marriage itself should be legal. Then I also prove the significance of the data I provide from the West Village which proves the opposite of what my opponent was trying to portray gay people as: violent, criminal, and unproductive. Then my opponent also fails to respond to my argument that gay people provide advantages to the community and that there is no warranted reason to punish or prevent them from being married in the state of Florida. The impact this has is that the con can never win in this debate because there is now no logical or warranted reason to deny this right to the gay citizens in Florida.

Not only will the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment prevent gay and lesbian couples from having any form of legal union but also takes away any existing legal and health benefits they currently possess. This shows that passes this amendment will negatively impact a substantial number of citizens in the state of Florida that could be avoided by voting no to the amendment. Domestic Partnerships will also be in danger if this amendment is passed.

I negate Euthanasia: The act or practice of killing or permitting the death of hopelessly sick or injured individuals (as persons or domestic animals) in a relatively painless way for reasons of mercy (Merriam-Webster) Voluntary Euthanasia: Those instances of euthanasia in which a clearly competent person makes a voluntary and enduring request to be helped to die.

Over the years we have experienced many ""miracles"" in medicine, many people, even in very recent years and months, who were expected to die, miraculously survived. If these people were to have been subjected to Euthanasia they would be dead now. These incidents have taught us to never lose hope and euthanasia is the very symbol of hopelessness. Contention 2: Hippocratic Oath Traditionally, doctors swear an oath when they receive their medical degree. This oath includes the phrase ""I shall do no harm""; proposing suicide is a direct violation of that oath. Contention 3: Religion My opponent and I are Christians. The vast majority of churches and church bodies, object to Euthanasia. They do so, because Christians believe that ""God gave us life and God should be the one to take it away"". This amongst others, means that no human should have the power of life and death. This is especially true in the case of doctors that may be pessimistic at points and can easily be influenced by third parties, such as health insurance companies (that want to avoid extra funds for treatment being wasted and apply Euthanasia). Contention 4: Pessimism Certain patients, doctors and family may be pessimistic. For example if you tell a patient that he will die in three months because of some disease and that the pain will gradually increase, until he/she dies. This might make them pessimistic and because they might fear the pain, they might choose to be mercy killed in order to avoid it. This will eliminate all slim chances of survival and rob the pessimistic patient of his/her last days with the people he/she loves. Contention 1: Euthanasia furthers human rights My opponent states that it is a human's right to decide to be killed when terminally ill. I agree with this to a certain point. First of all, certain things may effect the patient's and the doctor's judgment. Some examples of this are: pessimism, fear of pain and hopelessness in the case of the patient. Pressure to have funds and treatment rooms cleared for other patient, by hospitals and influence and bribes from health insurance companies (that to avoid extra funds for treatment being wasted and apply Euthanasia) for doctors. The above proves that doctor and patient may make mistakes in judgment that will result in the patient to be subjected to Euthanasia, and since death is irreversible possible mistakes can not be recalled. In conclusion, we might have the right to euthanasia, but we many times be wrong in our judgment and situations like the one explained in my 4th contention may occur, that may cost us our lives (in the worst scenario) or are last days with our family and friends (in the best). Contention 2: Euthanasia is consistent with utilitarianism. True, it is consistent in a way, but utilitarianism is nothing but a philosophical theory and there are many contradictory theories that prove that Euthanasia is immoral. In philosophy you usually can't say that something is wrong of right. For example utilitarianism is no more right or wrong than the philosophical theory of egoism. So, Euthanasia may be consistent with ONE philosophical point of view, utilitarianism [type of consequentialism], but it is contradictory to virtue ethics and deontological ethics as well as some types of consequentialism. Therefore, my opponent's point proves little. Contention 3: Euthanasia is often necessary. My opponent tries to prove his pint by providing one example. In the specific example (dying driver), the right course of action (morally and legally) is to call an ambulance and get him to the hospital and perhaps his life will be saved. Therefore, my opponent's example lacks moral and legal judgment and devalues life and science (medicine), by losing hope to soon and not giving medicine a chance to save a life, (even if chances are that it won 't succeed, the huge value of a human life still makes it worth it!).

96,"Yea, LD rules are good. I too look at Martin Luther King Jr as one of the wisest men to live as of this day. And I full agree with his quote, however, the context in which he said it does not apply to this debate round. Not one type of people as of the status-quo are being suppressed by our ""individualistic concerns"". We are all human, and we all do have individual concerns, its just natural and the way it is. It is ok to strive to fulfill those individual concerns, as long as no one is being put down in the process. When we look to the status-quo we see a judicial system that is working. Lowering ourselves to an international court will take away us autonomy and strip us of the very thing our nation stands on, individuality and independence. Definitions- Thank you for picking definitions that are fair to both sides of the debate, I truly do appreciate it. However, there is a minor problem in your ""crimes against humanity"" definition that I believe works against you. The definition is in context to war. All of those things are crimes against humanity when a country is at war. ""before or during the war"". So by this definition we see that any war at all that a person dies, is a crime against humanity. However, if this is true we see that the United States of America is the biggest offenders of ""crimes against humanity"". Now if you vote for the affirmative team based on these definitions the United States of America will be the first to be imprisoned based on the international code that defines ""crimes against humanity"" as murder that occurs in war. But because I do agree that this is a fair definition, we will keep it. The only thing is that it will hurt the affirmatives case drastically. I believe that Justice is a fair Value, so i am adopting it;the topic essentially calls for this value Your value Criterion is also fair, so I am adopting it, but will work against you in this debate. I will go over this in my case later on, just to keep it organized. Onto his case His first contention essentially says ""America isnt good for C.A.H. but the international court will be"" and, with all due respect, the argument is fundamentally flawed. If you look to who is driving for the international court, we see that it is the US. As of the status-quo, the United States has remained the hegemon and what we say goes. The world follows our norms, our habits, and conforms to what we want them to. When there is an international court, the same will happen. The US will be leading this court and what it says should be punishment will be. The only difference now is that the US has more power to reach around the whole world and not just in the US. So take this argument and completely turn it against the affirmative team. What will happen in an international court is that it will be American lead, and nothing will change from the status-quo except now America has even more power to serve ""injustices"". On his second contention. He says the court will be unbiased. However, if you look to the countries that are currently involved in the ICC, you see that they are just a bunch of random countries that have no pull whatsoever in the world, so of course they will not push their agenda on another country and they see as equals. A number of states, including China, Russia, India and the United States, have not joined the ICC, when the US joins it will push its agenda on the world immediately. The US is the biggest violators of rules, if they were to join they would change the court to what they saw fit. The US sees that the ICC has done absolutely nothing and will make changes to make it ""better"" these changes will push the western agenda. When you see that the affirmative case is self destructive, you cannot vote for it. Upon first reading the arguments you may think his way of thinking is best, however, when you look deeper into his definitions and contentions you see that they work against him, not for him. And my case. Contention 1- The ICC is horrible. The status-quo sees an international court system, and they have gotten absolutely nothing done. Look to the genocides happening in Rwanda and in the DRC. Thousands of people are dying, the people in the lead are not being dealt with. The ICC is just a bunch of random countries that mean nothing to world that are trying to come together. Their efforts are honorable, but the bottom line is that they are getting nothing done even by their own definitions. If they believe that ""murder in war"" is a C.A.H. then the US government should already be in jail. If they think that genocide is a C.A.H. they should have thrown everything they had behind efforts to stop thousands of women and children from being killed in Sub-Saharan Africa today. Contention 2- If the US went into it, they would just mold it to status-quo USA This destroys any reason for the US to succumb to the courts. Nothing would change at all. The USA is the world police status-quo and will continue to follow the same ethics in a world post plan. When this happens there are just more countries following the same ethics that the affirmative thinks is bad So when you look at the details of what will really happen after you affirm the resolution, you see that nothing changes. If anything, more crimes against humanity will be committed because the USA is now at the head of this court system.

100,"I thank my opponent for his interesting arguments. My opponent first states that the idea of comparative advantage does not really work in an environment of varying labor standards and unfair labor practices. His first impact states that unfair policies in China and other nations will undermine the competitiveness of small businesses in the US. However, his economic analysis here does not hold up. He ignores one crucially important fact: when another country sells the US cheap goods, American consumers benefit enormously. The Congressional Research Service reported in January of 2007 that, ""...low-cost imports [from China especially] have increased overall consumer welfare, enabling consumers to purchase other goods and services (and hence stimulating growth in other sectors of the economy)"" [1]. Thus, as consumers are able to do more and more with their money, our economy only grows larger and larger, and the small businesses my opponent is worried about will benefit. My opponent's second impact is that because of free trade, a gradual shift will occur in our societal values until we are as unjust with regard to labor policies as China. However, the tariffs he proposes will only exacerbate this potential problem. Let's look at it this way: when we trade with China (or any foreign nation, for that matter), both economies prosper. Why would American citizens continue to purchase foreign goods if it did not benefit them? If we restrict this trade, we will only hinder economic growth for both nations. If China's economy begins to lag behind, it's logical response would be to increase the use of unfair labor practices such as child labor; in the words of my opponent, China would be striving to become more efficient. On the other hand, by allowing free trade with China, we can encourage economic development in China. With growing prosperity in their country, Chinese businesses would no longer be forced to commit unfair practices and Chinese leaders would be able to ban unfair labor practices without fear of economic downturn. Basically, if we allow China to grow economically, we will see a reduction in unfair policies. This is true of any developing nation. Furthermore, China specifically is already working to improve labor conditions. In a speech at the Albert Shanker Institute in January of 2008, Li Qiang stated that, ""...the Chinese government is attempting to improve workers conditions..."" [2]. This is because of free trade with the US and other countries, not in spite of it. A protectionist stance now would only serve to reverse this positive trend. We can also look to past experience to see that tariffs are never an effective solution. For an example, let's look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This protectionist legislation was intended to free the US from the grip of the Great Depression, but, as Paul Blustein of the Brookings Institution noted in December of 2008, the act ""...is justifiably notorious for having triggered a disastrous cycle of trade conflict"" [3]. When the US imposed restrictions on the ability of other nations to sell their products to Americans, the global community retaliated by imposing similar restrictions on US products. This trade war was detrimental to the US and other countries. In the end, trade restrictions will only be counterproductive, and will never solve our trade problems. [1] <URL>... . [2] <URL>...

I thank my opponent for his interesting arguments.  
  
My opponent first states that the idea of comparative advantage does not really work in an environment of varying labor standards and unfair labor practices.  
  
His first impact states that unfair policies in China and other nations will undermine the competitiveness of small businesses in the US. However, his economic analysis here does not hold up. He ignores one crucially important fact: when another country sells the US cheap goods, American consumers benefit enormously. The Congressional Research Service reported in January of 2007 that, ""…low-cost imports [from China especially] have increased overall consumer welfare, enabling consumers to purchase other goods and services (and hence stimulating growth in other sectors of the economy)"" [1]. Thus, as consumers are able to do more and more with their money, our economy only grows larger and larger, and the small businesses my opponent is worried about will benefit.  
  
My opponent's second impact is that because of free trade, a gradual shift will occur in our societal values until we are as unjust with regard to labor policies as China. However, the tariffs he proposes will only exacerbate this potential problem. Let's look at it this way: when we trade with China (or any foreign nation, for that matter), both economies prosper. Why would American citizens continue to purchase foreign goods if it did not benefit them? If we restrict this trade, we will only hinder economic growth for both nations. If China's economy begins to lag behind, it's logical response would be to increase the use of unfair labor practices such as child labor; in the words of my opponent, China would be striving to become more efficient.  
On the other hand, by allowing free trade with China, we can encourage economic development in China. With growing prosperity in their country, Chinese businesses would no longer be forced to commit unfair practices and Chinese leaders would be able to ban unfair labor practices without fear of economic downturn. Basically, if we allow China to grow economically, we will see a reduction in unfair policies. This is true of any developing nation.  
  
Furthermore, China specifically is already working to improve labor conditions. In a speech at the Albert Shanker Institute in January of 2008, Li Qiang stated that, ""…the Chinese government is attempting to improve workers conditions…"" [2]. This is because of free trade with the US and other countries, not in spite of it. A protectionist stance now would only serve to reverse this positive trend.  
  
We can also look to past experience to see that tariffs are never an effective solution. For an example, let's look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. This protectionist legislation was intended to free the US from the grip of the Great Depression, but, as Paul Blustein of the Brookings Institution noted in December of 2008, the act ""…is justifiably notorious for having triggered a disastrous cycle of trade conflict"" [3]. When the US imposed restrictions on the ability of other nations to sell their products to Americans, the global community retaliated by imposing similar restrictions on US products. This trade war was detrimental to the US and other countries.  
  
In the end, trade restrictions will only be counterproductive, and will never solve our trade problems.

103,"Ladies and Gentlemen, the US government has a problem. Ok they have a sh*tload of problems but one of them stands out more than just about anything else. Its not the threat of nuclear war or inflation or unemployment or Decepticons........ No I am talking about bad politicians...... There is a saying in Israel that everyone on both sides want peace, but that all it takes is for one zealot to mess up everything. The same concept can be applied to the American government, where the few good politicians we have cannot bring America the change it needs because of the actions of one a**hole always undo's any progress made. What becomes of these bad politicians when they're term ends? bad publicity, low poll ratings, and that's about it. This nation needs to take a tougher stance against bad politicians, and I would recommend that they all be violated with a loaded shotgun in the behind but Chick-Fil-A is against that so I had to go with this instead.... Lets get to the point, When a politicians term ends (Politician = President, Senator, Representative, and Governor) then public approval ratings will determine if a president should FACE the option of being deported. If that politicians approval rating is below a critical point (lets put it at 19% for no reason at all) then the nation will be able to decide the fate of the politician and determine whether or not they will be allowed to stay in this country or get deported through a nation wide public vote. If the public votes in favor of deportation, then the politician is removed from the US. To recap this process 1) Approval ratings determine if a politician should be subjected to possible deportation 2) If approval rating is below 19% then the public will choose to vote in favor of or against deportation 3) If the public approves of deportation, politician is deported. If not, then he/she gets to stay 3 round debate so fire away!",1,imabench,"
