It is solely the parents decision whether or not to carry out the abortion, thus the child has absolutely no say in the matter. "" That would be like having malice towards a piece of bread that you put in the toaster, or towards a lug nut as you tighten it.

Was it immoral to smuggle slaves north out of Dixie?"" I understand that you are trying to make a connection to the above statements and the topic, but this is irrelevant. ""Again, this argument doesn't work in Pro's favor. Pro has no problem with murdering (in his view this is murder) the children of rape and incest victims. Therefore-even if we stipulated that abortion was murder, which we do not-Pro takes the position that murder isn't always wrong.""

Religion is a powerful force, fulfilling deep emotional and spiritual needs, it is likely that such considerations of 'secular' or mortal freedom are irrelevant to converts. In addition Islamic conversion in the west tends to be more common amongst the disenfranchised or poorer sections of the community, such as the prison population who in any case have been denied such liberty. <URL>... ""My opponent fears that Islamization will occur in Britain thus taking away many of his freedoms. While this is true, to a certain extent, wouldn't it be safer and healthier if certain things were taken out of society? For example, about 40% of all vehicle accidents in the US are contributed to intoxication."" If this is true 'to a certain extent' as my opponent concedes that she must also concede that my argument is true to a certain extent. The consumption of alcohol is a major aspect of my culture. Very few people are teetotal, and alcohol serves a central function to social gatherings and special occasions. I consider it my right to consume alcohol. I fully concede that it may be bad for my health, I will not question the existence of drunk driving but the negative effects of alcohol are a separate issue. Alcohol consumption is (tenuously I grant), an aspect of my civilisation. If Muslims reach a majority it will almost certainly be outlawed or at least greatly restricted. The number of Muslims as a proportion of the total population of my country are growing. Therefore Islam poses a threat to my civilisation. Alcohol is but a small matter, this can be extrapolated to the whole range of personal liberties that I enjoy. ""My opponent argues that Islam doesn't grant equality to men and women. This is indeed incorrect. Women are very much equal to men, but are treated differently. Men and women are biologically distinct individuals who have different needs. For example, men are usually physically stronger so should be responsible for more physical labour. As childbearers, most women have natural maternal instincts which generally make them better for raising children."" I do not deny that the genders are different, this however is a departure from the relevant point. A bricklayer and a theoretical physicist are different, but they are both accorded equality under the law. The rules of divorce in Islam do not accord both genders legal equality. It is easier for a man to divorce his wife, than for a wife to divorce her husband, <URL>... . This shows clear inequality between the genders. ""Even the Qur'an doesn't say women are inferior."" It even goes so far I believe as to say men and women are equal. However two issues need to be considered. 1: We are discussing the nature of the Islamic religion, which though derived from the Koran is not the Koran, but rather the net result of humans reading, distorting, interpreting, successfully and unsuccessfully following it's rules or what they believe to be it's rules. My opponent has not challenged my examples of gender inequality in Islam. 2: Despite the claim that the genders are equal the koran lays down rules for a man to beat his wife, it does not lay down rules for a wife to beat her husband. This is therefore inequality. <URL>... Therefore as the practice of Islam denies the equality of the genders, and as the practice of Islam is growing in my country it represents a direct threat to the personal liberty of half the population and a threat to the very nature of my civilisation which is built on egalitarian and democratic principles. ""My opponent points out that my comparison involving the Spanish Inquisition was unfair. I'll like to counter with another comparison. America. Wouldn't America invading Islamic countries be a threat to Islamic civilization? Why the double standard, especially when thousands of innocent civilians are being killed by western invasions? The amounts of people who are being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan is more significant than the numbers of those killed in terrorist attacks against the west."" Though my opponent raises an interesting point, it is obvious that my refutation or concession of this point has no bearing on the resolution.

The rules of divorce in Islam do not accord both genders legal equality. It is easier for a man to divorce his wife, than for a wife to divorce her husband,   http://www.islamonline.net...  .  
  
This shows clear inequality between the genders.  
  
""Even the Qur'an doesn't say women are inferior.""  
  
It even goes so far I believe as to say men and women are equal. However two issues need to be considered.  
1: We are discussing the nature of the Islamic religion, which though derived from the Koran is not the Koran, but rather the net result of humans reading, distorting, interpreting, successfully and unsuccessfully following it's rules or what they believe to be it's rules. My opponent has not challenged my examples of gender inequality in Islam.  
2: Despite the claim that the genders are equal the koran lays down rules for a man to beat his wife, it does not lay down rules for a wife to beat her husband. This is therefore inequality.   http://www.thereligionofpeace.com...  
  
Therefore as the practice of Islam denies the equality of the genders, and as the practice of Islam is growing in my country it represents a direct threat to the personal liberty of half the population and a threat to the very nature of my civilisation which is built on egalitarian and democratic principles.  
  
""My opponent points out that my comparison involving the Spanish Inquisition was unfair. I'll like to counter with another comparison. America. Wouldn't America invading Islamic countries be a threat to Islamic civilization? Why the double standard, especially when thousands of innocent civilians are being killed by western invasions? The amounts of people who are being killed in Iraq and Afghanistan is more significant than the numbers of those killed in terrorist attacks against the west.""  
  
Though my opponent raises an interesting point, it is obvious that my refutation or concession of this point has no bearing on the resolution. My civilisation is not threatened in this context accept by reprisals by Muslims, so it can only serve to support my claim.  
  
In my opinion my opponent has not refuted any of the points I have made thus far.",Religion,2,Islam-is-a-direct-threat-to-civilization./1/,31191

13,"As there are no questions regarding definitions, I shall assume they are all accepted. Firstly, I wish to mention there are no known non-biblical references to a historical Jesus by any writer of the time during and after Jesus's purported existence. In the words of Barbara Walker: ""No literate person of his own time mentioned him in any known writing."" Jewish philosopher Judaeus of Alexandria, alive at the proposed time of Jesus, the wealthiest and best connected citizens of the Empire, says nothing of Christ in his voluminous writings. Nor do any of the many historians and writers who flourished during the first one to two centuries of the era, and even then, nothing comes up until the time of Iraenius. Secondly, in the words of Justin Martyr: And when we say also that the Word, who is the first-birth of God, was produced without sexual union, and that He, Jesus Christ, our Teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you esteem sons of Jupiter. This shows again something that one needs to look at. The Biblical idea of Jesus Christ comes up in most people mind at the date 0 AD (the inexistence of the date is irrelevant). However, the canon source of the Bible is what is of importance. The Bible, written in 325 AD by the First Council of Nicaea[1]. The Greeks The first place to start will be the greeks. They are an old group (older than Christianity at least) and hold many stories which closely link to that of Christianity. Also, due to the geographic proximity, it is highly likely that these two groups had a lot of contact with each other. In fact, it is almost certain: both places being part of the Roman Empire before the first council of Nicaea, after all, made their link almost definite. Homer's work has also been found in the area, as well as references to Aeschylus, so the correlation is very likely to have existed. The character I wish to recognise first is Prometheus. Prometheus is is a Titan, a champion of mankind, known for his wily intelligence, who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to mortals. (or mankind had fire, Zeus took it away, then Prometheus gave it back). Zeus then crucified him, but forgave the sins of man. Firstly, Prometheus descended from heaven as a deitious being in order to give mankind fire and was punished for doing so by Zeus. Jesus descended from heaven as a deitious being in order to give mankind New Rules and was punished for doing so by the community. The community then crucified him, but forgave the sins of man. The main clashes here are obvious: Jesus/Prometheus' descendence from heaven, descended as a deitious being, the fire/new rules and the giver of the punishment. The first requires my opponent to prove that there is a difference[2]. This is also true of the second[2]. The third and the fourth require more allegorical interpretation - that is not to say more forced interpretetation, but simply not taking the phrase ""fire"" as meaning a literal burning stick of wood. Fire was allegorical, as were many things in the play, but the fire was one that was an ""obvious and transparent symbol""[3]. The fire, according to sparknotes, represents the gift of artistic and technological advancement, however the limiting scope to these two things is undesirable: Vellacott and many other literary scholars[4] put forth that it is complete growth in all aspects, a spiritual and philosophical growth as well as all others, and that limitting it to just science is ungrounded. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the fire was a growth done to increase humanity and human understanding. Now, the comparison to Jesus in this way is very clear. Jesus being the light to illuminate us all[5] is clear, and Jesus being known as the truth is obvious as well[6]. Regarding the crucifixion, the chaining to the 'stone' is well known as being similar: Dr. Martin Hengel remarks: When describing how his hero is fastened to two rocks in the Caucasus, Lucian uses all the technical terms of a crucifixion: Prometheus is to be nailed to two rocks above a ravine in the sight of all, in such a way as to produce the effect of ""a most serviceable cross"" Simone Weil uses the word ""crucifies"" to describe specifically the event that happened with both Prometheus and Jesus.[7] There are many people who see this correlation, and it is not one that is rare. There is a massive correlation between these two ideas. I shall present other correlations in my future post, and await a rebuttal. Remember, the debate is whether it is most likely that the ideas of Jesus came from other mythologies, not that they definitely did. 1 - en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea 2- Hamilton, Edith Mythology 3 - <URL>... 4 - Philip Vellacott, Prometheus Bound and Other Plays: The Suppliants; Seven Against Thebes; The Persians 5 - <URL>... 6 - <URL>... 7 - Intimations of Christianity among the Greek philosophers",1,Stephen_Hawkins,"

Fire was allegorical, as were many things in the play, but the fire was one that was an ""obvious and transparent symbol""[3].  The fire, according to sparknotes, represents the gift of artistic and technological advancement, however the limiting scope to these two things is undesirable:  Vellacott and many other literary scholars[4] put forth that it is complete growth in all aspects, a spiritual and philosophical growth as well as all others, and that limitting it to just science is ungrounded.  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the fire was a growth done to increase humanity and human understanding.  Now, the comparison to Jesus in this way is very clear.  Jesus being the light to illuminate us all[5] is clear, and Jesus being known as the truth is obvious as well[6].  Regarding the crucifixion, the chaining to the 'stone' is well known as being similar:  Dr. Martin Hengel remarks:  
  When describing how his hero is fastened to two rocks in the Caucasus, Lucian uses all   the technical terms of a crucifixion: Prometheus is to be nailed to two rocks above a   ravine in the sight of all, in such a way as to produce the effect of ""a most serviceable   cross""  
  Simone Weil uses the word ""crucifies"" to describe specifically the event that happened with both Prometheus and Jesus.[7]  There are many people who see this correlation, and it is not one that is rare.    There is a massive correlation between these two ideas.  I shall present other correlations in my future post, and await a rebuttal.  Remember, the debate is whether it is   most likely   that the ideas of Jesus came from other mythologies, not that they definitely did.      1 -   en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea   2- Hamilton, Edith   Mythology   3 -   http://www.sparknotes.com...   4 -  Philip Vellacott,   Prometheus Bound and Other Plays: The Suppliants; Seven Against Thebes; The Persians    5 -   http://www.jesusisthelight.net...  6 -    http://bible.cc...  7 -    Intimations of Christianity among the Greek philosophers

With this in mind, lets be clear, the claim that Jesus died for our sins, is not Jesus paying our parking fines, but rather our sins that are so great, that it requires God to send people to hell for eternity because of them.

If one had to either be an agnostic or an atheist, than given the current evidence and amount of scientific and philosophical progress, one should choose atheism. [Definition - Atheism] <URL>... 2 a: a disbelief in the existence of deity [Definition - Agnostic] <URL>... 1: a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable ; broadly : one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god The latter part of this definition =====Arguments===== 1. Agnosticism is Epistemology At best, agnosticism should be described as a position in epistemology, which is the part of philosophy that is concerned with truth and knowledge (to be broad). Agnostics believe that absolute knowledge about God is impossible unless we had absolute knowledge of the universe. And this is true - but also pointless to state.

I affirm the resolution: atheism is the more logical and supported position than agnosticism. If one had to either be an agnostic or an atheist, than given the current evidence and amount of scientific and philosophical progress, one should choose atheism.

1. Agnosticism is Epistemology  
  
At best, agnosticism should be described as a position in epistemology, which is the part of philosophy that is concerned with truth and knowledge (to be broad). Agnostics believe that absolute knowledge about God is impossible unless we had absolute knowledge of the universe. And this is true - but also pointless to state. Because ANYTHING that is not a posteriori can not be known with 100% certainty unless one has absolute knowledge of the universe.  
  
For example, what if I argued there are no such thing as fairies? Someone might go up to me and say ""well you don't know! There could be fairies in some far-off distant star that we haven't discovered yet! Do you know everything about everywhere in the entire universe?! NO, didn't think so. Kiss the foot"". Now if we can agree with this person's statement, than this means we have a whole new mess on our hands? That we have a-fairiests and agnosti-fairiests? Of course not.  
  
When one says the don't believe something is true, they aren't saying that it's 100% impossible - unless it's a prior statements, which are claims that are fulfilled by definition (All bachelors are unmarried). God's epistemological position should be no different from any other thing out there, which is why Agnosticism shouldn't be heralded as a separate position.

Con says ""metaphysically Christ BECOMES us and pays our sin,"" What's the difference between christ becoming some one else, and christ metaphysically becoming some one else ? I think further explanation is needed here. Con says ""It is not simply that our sin is paid for, our sin is removed from existence, metaphysically it is as though we never sinned"" What's the difference between never sinning, and metaphysically never sinning ? Con says ""A more fair comparison to our justice system would be if a person comitted a crime, and then the judge went back in time and prevented them from comitting the crime and comitted it himself instead"" So the judge prevented the crime (so it didn't happen), but commits the crime himself (so it did happen). Also what ever happened to Jesus being sinless, in this illustration the judge is guilty because they themselves commit the crime. I suspect that Con realizes the contradictions here, Jesus is himself and some one else and some one has sinned but has never sinned. So I suspect Con is trying to justify these contradictions by implying that some how metaphysics allow for these contradictions, like I said further explanation is required here.

Similarly, Van McGee's argument has been much discussed and shown not to do what Meyer tries to propose for it in this debate. That's for another time and place (my place, perhaps), if there is interest. Meyer's own claim is, in part: > ""not that the argument is invalid in a particular system > of logic where it would be valid..."" That also is a different debate as is Meyer's effort to suggest, only suggest, that there may be some legitimate logical system in which my argument would be considered INvalid. If he finds one, I will be glad to consider it. The exercise is not about quibbling over ""logical systems"" or whether or not my argument is valid in one or all legitimate, real world logical systems. That my argument may be valid, by definition, according to the rules of one or all legitimate, real world logical systems is incidental/coincidental to the issue before us here. Atheists make the affirmative claim, reach the conclusion, that the idea/concept of God was a product of the imaginative powers of the mind of man. I have presented one argument which, if its premises are true, allows the atheist to reach that conclusion. I propose that atheists cannot, successfully, divorce their affirmative claim from my argument and its implications. I don't recall any of my opposition offering any better argument that supports the conclusion, the atheists' affirmation, though many imaginative stories have been offered as to how the idea/concept originated. The discussion is about reason, not logical systems. In affirming ""imagination"" as the conclusion, the atheist implies the belief that man was possessed of such a power so as to have accomplished the feat; the minor premise. Some even are so bold as to affirmatively, explicitly, claim that the minor premise is true. Given that the conclusion is affirmed and that the minor premise is affirmed, we can easily construct the major premise necessary to complete the reasoning that would, if true, support the atheists' conclusion. My argument is constructed in such a manner that if its premises are true, then its conclusion will follow as true therefrom. To save a little time and effort, we have been referring to such a construction as being ""logically valid"". In closing, I will state my opinion as to why so many have fought so hard against simply, successfully completing the exercise; so much so that they have, historically, refused to take the simplest Step #1 and deal openly, honestly with it. My argument fairly and reasonably reflects a fundamental position of atheists. Atheists implicitly and/or explicitly believe one or both premises to be true. It is undisputed that atheists believe the conclusion to be true. Atheists don't like to admit ""believing"" such things. They ""believe"" the premises and conclusion of my argument, implicitly and/or explicitly. Such beliefs go beyond the evidence upon which their beliefs are based, and some have been open and honest enough to admit that such is the case by noting that one or both of the premises are lacking in evidence and may, in fact, not be true. No tricks. No traps. Just the way it is; in my opinion. It's nice to know as one considers the popular public debate over such things. Atheists don't believe there is any ""God"". OK! I get it!

I offer the following definitions for this debate:  Atheism   - a lack of belief in a higher power  Christianity   - the belief in the following:  1) The Christian God exists, and he is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.  2) This God created the universe and everything in it  3) This God has sent his son, Jesus Christ, to Earth in order to absolve humanity of original sin  4) Jesus has died for the sins of humanity, and was resurrected three days later to live again  (Feel free to make changes to my definition of Christianity)  Since there is no clearly defined resolution, I propose that the topic be:  ""Christianity is an accurate representation of reality"".

30,"I thank Con. As per rules, first round is Pro's first argument. Resolved: Abortion is Immoral. Abortion is defined as the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus. Immoral is defined as not moral: broadly : conflicting with generally or traditionally held moral principles. Moral is defined as of or relating to principles of right and wrong in behavior. I will now present my argument. Contention 1: Abortion is murder ""... embryo which is implanted in the lining of the uterus and develops a separate circulatory system with its own blood supply receiving nourishment and oxygen from the placenta."" From the above, an embryo is clearly alive, therefore the act of abortion is murder should be considered immoral. The fact that abortion is legal in the majority of cases, even encouraged at times, is most definitely immoral. Contention 2: In most cases, abortion is useless In the majority of cases where abortion is useless. The only cases where abortion is acceptable is rape and incest. With these two cases you can easily limit the usage of abortion to only these two, all other cases where abortion is unnecessary can be restricted. Also, in the case of rape, proper medical care can prevent the woman from becoming pregnant. Contention 3: The majority of abortion cases are given by minors. This inexperience can cause the minor to not choose any better alternatives and rashly choose the abortion method. Later on, the minor has regretted of their decision. [1] <URL>...

This is a question because that argument is so far used in the CON side so idk what good its doing the PRO. Next you again made the fallacy of equivocating non-religion upbringing with a religious one and then you for some reason said it was fallacious after this was just explained to you so...? You have brought up however the main strong point for the PRO side which is a parent may view their child not following the religion to have eternal consequences in that religion. The problem is that this is eternal consequences according to that parent not reality. Again you re-mention what I did that the parents religion has an ultimate truth, making the child accept this truth against their will is trespassing on that individuals freedom of speech and religion. Lastly you made the point that if you raise a child in a non-religious way they will have a more logical and reasonable way of evaluating religion. Well of course they will that's the whole point. You should determine what you believe using logic and reason it should have nothing to do with indoctrination or upbringing or emotion or myths with good morals. It should be entirely based on logic so yes there is a logic based bias because the last thing you want is an upbringing that will evade that, a religious one. To go further we do have to take into account that many children who try to defect from their parents religion are around 13 and up. Not to say this is when we are wisest nor to say invulnerable to having an advantage taken of us but this is when we develop enough mentally to at least question why we should believe what we are being told. Also to add lets not forget what we are talking about here, not just indoctrination but enforcement of it. If your child comes to you and says they never want to go to church again or that they do not want to believe in your god(s) or that they wish to change religions it really is not your right to tell them no.

Raising a child religiously will rob them of this or make their first 17 years of life years they cannot use this. As you pointed out religion is different from logical bias but if you can't defend your belief using evidence and logical argument what right do you have to make your child say it is true. If you cannot prove it then the child should have every right to defect and if that makes them an atheist or another religion too bad. If there is something I did not mention or counter I apologize.

2) Why does Con think I need to prove or assume that the new testament is historically accurate for me to object to penal atonement theory ?

52,"I thank stepphon66 for instigating this debate. First of all, I would like to remind my opponent that the BoP lies on Pro as he made the claim. I also remind my opponent that while this debate had been put in the religion category, it does not have a religious topic. Instead my opponent merely uses arguments pertaining to religion to support his claim, and only made the statement ""you will have to explain what evidence or premises christians and buddhists etc. have and how their beliefs can all be true"" after I accepted. Therefore I will not be limiting myself to religious grounds (nor ignoring it), and I urge my opponent to do the same. Credulous as defined by Dictionary.com is ""willing to believe or trust too readily, especially without proper or adequate evidence; gullible."" Note that while my opponent focuses on the terms 'without ... evidence; gullible' [1], the definition included the phrase 'too readily', which implies a repeating pattern. A similar phrase is present in multiple other trusted online dictionary sources [2]. Indeed, for a trait to be part of an individual (which the word 'are' in the topic backs up as the definition of the claim) and not merely present it has to be dominating. Therefore, to make the claim that ""Most people are credulous"", the claim that ""Most people are credulous most of the time"" has to be made first. The evidence and statistics my opponent provides, then, (and may I add are without source or evidence) are not enough to prove that statement, in the same sense that we don't call someone a liar if they had lied twice in their life. Now, my opponent seems to assume that all individuals who believe in a religion believes based on 'whatever their leaders recommend' and utilizes no evidence. The truth is vastly more complicated on several counts. I will now present several exceptions to my opponent's claim. Religion aren""t cults. There are no definite leader(s) for all believers of any certain religion. Many believers believe of their own accord, without relying on a leader to know what to believe. The simplest and most verifiable example being myself, as I am a christian yet believe based off my own choices rather than what my parents or any church leaders tell me. There is a distinction between 'credulous' and 'ignorant'. In this context, credulous is believing in something with little to none evidence, while ignorant is believing in something with lots of evidence, but all the wrong ones. An individual may believe in a religion with many fallacies, yet still not be credulous, as they believe that the evidence they""ve been provided is enough for a rational belief, even if they seem ridiculous to others. Pro fails to regard this possibility in his arguments. Pascal's Wager is an argument made by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century [4] on the rational choice of believing in God in order to not risk the possibility of losing infinite eternal gain or vice versa, should it happen to be true. In this case individuals who abide by this principle are not credulous, as they do not believe ""readily"", the decision came after extensive rational thought, they acknowledge the lack of evidences, and they are certainly not gullible. I will now provide a argument of my own. As I said earlier, for an individual to be classified as credulous the trait must be dominant. Yet our society functions on non-credulousness. From grocery shopping to crime courts, we require credibility. In a credulous society, criminals will be released based on their statements of innocence, and costumers will spend a fortune for an ordinary rock just because they are told so. Thus our society cannot have most of its individuals be credulous. I look forward to my opponent""s rebuttal and to learn from a fellow debater. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>...

Now, my opponent seems to assume that all individuals who believe in a religion believes based on 'whatever their leaders recommend' and utilizes no evidence. The truth is vastly more complicated on several counts. I will now present several exceptions to my opponent's claim.  
  
Religion aren""t cults. There are no definite leader(s) for all believers of any certain religion. Many believers believe of their own accord, without relying on a leader to know what to believe. The simplest and most verifiable example being myself, as I am a christian yet believe based off my own choices rather than what my parents or any church leaders tell me.  
  
There is a distinction between 'credulous' and 'ignorant'. In this context, credulous is believing in something with little to none evidence, while ignorant is believing in something with lots of evidence, but all the wrong ones. An individual may believe in a religion with many fallacies, yet still not be credulous, as they believe that the evidence they""ve been provided is enough for a rational belief, even if they seem ridiculous to others. Pro fails to regard this possibility in his arguments.  
  
Pascal's Wager is an argument made by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century [4] on the rational choice of believing in God in order to not risk the possibility of losing infinite eternal gain or vice versa, should it happen to be true. In this case individuals who abide by this principle are not credulous, as they do not believe ""readily"", the decision came after extensive rational thought, they acknowledge the lack of evidences, and they are certainly not gullible.  
  
I will now provide a argument of my own. As I said earlier, for an individual to be classified as credulous the trait must be dominant. Yet our society functions on non-credulousness. From grocery shopping to crime courts, we require credibility. In a credulous society, criminals will be released based on their statements of innocence, and costumers will spend a fortune for an ordinary rock just because they are told so. Thus our society cannot have most of its individuals be credulous.  
  
I look forward to my opponent""s rebuttal and to learn from a fellow debater.
