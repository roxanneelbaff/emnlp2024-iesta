Quotes like these are evasive, because whatever their field experience may be, it is not demonstrably experience in the waterboarding being defended-- Abu Ghraib, last I heard, was being run by a military police unit that wasn't even properly trained CO's, it isn't comparable to CIA waterboarding of the sort anyone's defending.

Although these last only a few minutes and take place under medical supervision, he concluded that ""waterboarding is a torture technique - period""."" This particular quote is beating a dead horse, I never disputed that waterboarding is torture, since we are in agreement on that matter, we can usefully omit that measurement by this point. "" ""the current U.S. Army Field Manual recognizes that torture and inhuman treatment is ineffective, stating that ""Use of torture and other illegal methods is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear."""" Let's take a look at this. First of all, they don't reference which field manual they are talking about (Wikipedia says the US Army had 542 field manuals in circulation as of 27 July 2007). I've managed to find in field manual 2-22-3, however. Let's look at the context. It's essentially a beginner's guide to HUMINT collection in pursuit of ""The commander's needs."" This is the manual new interrogators are expected to learn, it provides ""Doctrinal guidance,"" among other things-- Hmm, doctrine. Do you think, maybe, if there's something that they'd REALLY REALLY get in trouble letting a just-trained person holding the rank of Private do something, they might tell him it's ineffective even if it's not true? Or in this case, plain fallacious. Pretty much ALL interrogation efforts yield unreliable results and induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to here. It's up to the organization ordering the interrogation to counter this influence by creating a context in which lies can be quickly found out. And torture isn't a first resort, it's a last in one's interrogations, so ""damaging subsequent collection efforts"" is irrelevant when not dealing with an interrogator who doesn't have a logical sense of the correct order of operations down.

7,"Thank you, Bricheze, for accepting this debate. As my opponent is debating the pro/aff, she must be able to prove that retreating is not the better option in any scenario but one. I will first state my case, then move onto my opponent's I do not agree with the following statement of Stalin: ""Die, but do not retreat."" Retreat is defined as ""the forced or strategic withdrawal of an army or an armed force before an enemy"" - dictionary.com Arthur Wellesley, during Bonaparte's 100 day campaign, retreated from Quatre Bras to Waterloo in order for an easier win. If Wellesley had not retreated, Bonaparte would have most likely won. From a military standpoint, it was a better decision to retreat to Waterloo. This is a situation where it is better to retreat than to die. Another example from the Napoleonic Era involves the Russians. When Bonaparte marched into Russia with 500-600,000 men, the Russians retreated and applied a scorched earth policy. Bonaparte and his men went all the way to Moscow and got nothing as the city had been burnt down. Napoleon turned around at Moscow. The Russians suffered few casualties and the French army had been decimated to a mere 10,000. This is another situation where it is better to retreat than to die. The definition of retreat says that it can be for a strategic withdrawal. And as my two examples above show, it is better to retreat now and then for the purpose of strategy. From a less literal view, the statement ""die, but do not retreat"" is not always the wisest choice. For instance, when arguing with someone, and the facts say you are wrong, the wisest course of action is to concede defeat. If you know you are blatantly wrong, to continue arguing would be futile. It is not always about supporting your views. If you think it is right go ahead and believe it all you want, even if you cannot explain why you believe it, but in an argument give up and leave once you are proven wrong. ----------------------------------------------------My opponent's case-------------------------------------------------------------- My opponent agrees with the quote for the following reasons: 1) Retreating weakens you and strengthens the opposition 2) By being persistent you may outlast the opposition 3) The damage done to you as a result of persisting may cause the opposition to stop fighting 4) By persisting you become more memorable in history For the first reason my opponent claims that retreating is giving up and thus you lose a battle and your opponent has the better hand in the following battle. This is does not work because retreating can be used as a strategy. As I showed in my examples, retreating can be used to strengthen yourself rather than your opponent. And again, my opponent must prove the statement true in all situations. My opponent's second reason is something that has little opportunity of working. An army will most likely not run away because the other is ""scarier."" Rather, they would surrender or retreat to safety to decide on a better course of action. Proving your worth by fighting until the end is not a good incentive for the soldiers. If you go and tell your soldiers, to be remembered you must die, do you really think they would care to be remembered? I would think the answer would be ""no."" The soldiers will not do their best if this is their motivation. Now the three things my opponent says the opposition may realize: A) You will not back down, and they will either have to destroy you or leave you alone. If they went through the trouble of trying to kill you, then they will continue to try to kill you. And if they would attempt to destroy you, would that not be worse for you? By retreating you can regroup into a more effective attack. Which makes it harder for the opposition. B) You will do a lot of damage to their troops--raising the question: Is it worth it? But you are fighting to the death, in such a case the casualties lay more heavily on your side, meaning less damage to the opposition in the following attack. Worsening the situation does not benefit you. C) You are strong and will continue to fight until we are demolished or you die. Next time, they could come in larger numbers and be even more powerful, could we lose the next battle? Should we continue? This is basically B in other words. So the previous argument applies here as well. With larger numbers, it would be easier for you, but why would the opposition not have a larger army? You do not send out the whole army to one battle. The numbers will not matter too much. My opponent moves on to saying this is a useful tactic. But when it hurts you rather than help you, it cannot be useful unless you are trying to lose. For my opponent's last argument of proving yourself, becoming more memorable in history, I would like to bring back the incentive that this is supplying: ""to be remembered, you must die."" If this was true, I would not want to be remembered. I think that many people would agree with me on this as well. I await my opponent's response.",1,karththegeld,"

It's not steering the debate away from A to discuss X if A's truth or falsehood is dependent on X's truth or falsehood. "" This would appear to basically consist of self-preservation with a slight touch of hedonism. It is an interpretation I am not really familiar with but sounds similar to the amorality (unconcerned with right and wrong) of Aleistair Crowley who's philosophy was ""do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."""" How is ""doing what thou wilt"" in any way similar to doing what will keep you alive and hopefully happy (alive being the first requirement)? Surely telling someone considering drugs to ""do what thou wilt"" isn't good for their life :). "" I am glad that he feels his own interpretation (supposedly) backed up by his one cited source (Wikepedia) is superior to that of several reputable dictionaries and although this opinion radically redefines morality it is in fact not contradictory of the ""universal death"" model."" You misinterpreted. The dictionaries don't prescribe the universal death model because they don't make any prescriptions-- they just say, in essence, morality is morality, and don't go any further really in telling you what the word means :). It is they, not the ""universal death"" model that my statements don't contradict :). "". Instead it discusses Eudaimonia, commonly translated as happiness, but usually seen as having connotations with virtue and knowledge.he section referring to Aristotle says: ""Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty, pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial) friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental and/or unchanging is the best).Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However, unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure."" It sounds like the Aristotelian position supports the established version and if anyone is backing up my opponent it is the hedonist Epicurus. "" You missed the ""human flourishing"" part, the ""complete life"" part, the ""non-sacrificial"" part-- need I go on? "" My opponent seems here to be cheerfully condoning murder and rape as well as torture. Is he saying that if someone pushes you, you can murder them?"" Would it be conducive to one's life to attempt to murder someone every time they push you? I think not. Surely more egregious force would be required to practically justify such a retaliation. I was merely delineating the principle on which such an action would be automatically excluded from consideration. "" If a woman is guilty of slapping him around the face, he is morally entitled to rape her?"" See above. "" Nice use of vocabulary. I argue that if knowledge is accepted without sufficient proof it becomes a moral issue.

""  
My opponent seems to have manoeuvred this debate away from a discussion of the rights and wrongs of water boarding (which he does not refer to once in round 2) and seems determined to defend his peculiar (if not ""bizarre"") idea of morality.""  
It's not steering the debate away from A to discuss X if A's truth or falsehood is dependent on X's truth or falsehood.  
  
""  
This would appear to basically consist of self-preservation with a slight touch of hedonism. It is an interpretation I am not really familiar with but sounds similar to the amorality (unconcerned with right and wrong) of Aleistair Crowley who's philosophy was ""do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.""""  
How is ""doing what thou wilt"" in any way similar to doing what will keep you alive and hopefully happy (alive being the first requirement)? Surely telling someone considering drugs to ""do what thou wilt"" isn't good for their life :).  
  
""  
I am glad that he feels his own interpretation (supposedly) backed up by his one cited source (Wikepedia) is superior to that of several reputable dictionaries and although this opinion radically redefines morality it is in fact not contradictory of the ""universal death"" model.""  
You misinterpreted. The dictionaries don't prescribe the universal death model because they don't make any prescriptions-- they just say, in essence, morality is morality, and don't go any further really in telling you what the word means :). It is they, not the ""universal death"" model that my statements don't contradict :).  
  
"". Instead it discusses Eudaimonia, commonly translated as happiness, but usually seen as having connotations with virtue and knowledge.he section referring to Aristotle says:  
""Eudaimonia is constituted, according to Aristotle, not by honor, or wealth, or power, but by rational activity in accordance with virtue over a complete life. Such activity manifests the virtues of character, including, honesty, pride, friendliness, and wittiness; the intellectual virtues, such as rationality in judgment; and non-sacrificial (i.e. mutually beneficial) friendships and scientific knowledge (knowledge of things that are fundamental and/or unchanging is the best).Epicurus agrees with Aristotle that eudaimonia is the highest good. However, unlike Aristotle, he identifies eudaimonia with pleasure.""  
It sounds like the Aristotelian position supports the established version and if anyone is backing up my opponent it is the hedonist Epicurus.  
""  
You missed the ""human flourishing"" part, the ""complete life"" part, the ""non-sacrificial"" part-- need I go on?  
  
""  
My opponent seems here to be cheerfully condoning murder and rape as well as torture.  
Is he saying that if someone pushes you, you can murder them?""  
Would it be conducive to one's life to attempt to murder someone every time they push you? I think not. Surely more egregious force would be required to practically justify such a retaliation. I was merely delineating the principle on which such an action would be automatically excluded from consideration.  
  
""  
If a woman is guilty of slapping him around the face, he is morally entitled to rape her?""  
See above.  
  
""  
Nice use of vocabulary. I argue that if knowledge is accepted without sufficient proof it becomes a moral issue.

Instead of depriving this human being of his/her right to live you can put them in prison this more effective than the brutal action of killing for many reasons. First of all, the criminal is still punished severely for his acts and perhaps even in a worse way than death would punish him (many prisoners in Europe have asked to be killed).

19,"I wholesomely thank the pro side for presenting their arguments in a clear and concise manner. I shall be rebutting them one by one, and of course, I'll be putting my sources at the end of the post. Ladies and gentlemen, let us proceed: Pro argues by saying that the death penalty offers social benifits; the first one being peace of mind. I agree that the possibility of a prisoner escaping exists, but statistics show that the odds of that happening are extremely low (1). ' 6,530 people escaped or were AWOL from state prisons. That was a littlemore than one-half of 1 percent of the total population of 1,100,224 state prisoners.' It doesn't end there. Most of these ""breakouts"" are usually recovered. In average, 10000 escapees result in 9000 of these recovered within the same year (1). And that was statistical data from 1998 . As for the present? It should be known that prison escapes are declining due to technology breakthrough (2): As it is seen from this chart, there's in average FOUR escapes per TEN THOUSAND PRISONER (2013 data). That's a number so low, that the chances of being attacked by a prisoner that has escaped from detention are nigh ZERO (You may find the full chart with detailed numbers in the source ndeg2). Now the question to ask is whether it is worth it to apply the death sentence when the rist of prison breakthroughs is so low. I will give my based opinion WHILE rebutting the rest of his aruguments. The second argument provided is a classic. Ah, the theory of ""example"". Pro states that the death penalty serves as a deterrent for potentional criminals, and as an example to murderers. I completely and categorically disagree with that notion, and I will state why: Far, far from scaring away criminals and deterring murderers, the death penalty desensitizes the masses to death, and I have many anecdotal evidences, as well as scientifical and statistical evidence to prove that (more on that later). Not only that, but the ""example theory"" makes no sense whatsoever seeing how the death penalty is currently organized. If you really want the death penalty to be ""deterring"", it has to be seen by the masses. Bring back the medieval age, Farinacci, tormentors, dismembrements, public torching, yada yada; it is a requirement to make the theory work. But in the US and other countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty... you miserably behead or hang a poor man in a deserted boulevard with no one passing, no witnesses (aside from the family of the victim). As for the evidence, let us look at a countries that practiced the death penalty, and how that practice has inevitably contributed to desensitize the masses: France. Not only did the death penalty not reduce the crime rates compared to its neighbour countries that did abolish it, but it resulted in extremely barbaric scenes due to to the desensitization of the masses. Victor Hugo, a french poet and the lead of the romantic scene, gave us a lot of temoinages of his time, alongside some other authors as well. 1832, 5 mars, during the execution of Louis Camus, the public who assisted (because capital punishment was public at the time) swayed towards the guilottine and started dancing around the headless body, and some were said to be ""playing football"" with the head. And that's only one temoinage, as he has left countless more as well. Bottom line, everytime there was a public capital execution, the people of France feisted, sold places to assist as if it was the country circus, dansed around the guillotine, et cetera (3). ALSO; The scientific conclusion is clear. The death penalty does not deter homicide . No study has ever found a deterrent effect, no matter how skewed the research question was in favor the death penalty. Pro has failed to abide by the burden of proof because on study has found any connection whatsoever between decreasing criminality rates and the death penalty. I challenge Pro to prove me otherwise. Actually, studies suggest the exact contrary! The brutalization effect suggests that when violence is condoned via the death penalty, more violence occurs. Homicide rates tend to increase around the time of executions, due to legitimation, desensitization, and imitation. The death penalty makes society more dangerous by further increasing violence through the brutalization effect (4). As for the cost arguments, I must say that Pro is flat out wrong. The death penalty is quite expensive and life imprisonment can be cheaper (5). Over the lifetime of a case, executing prisoners can be three times as expensive as life in prison, primarily due to the higher costs of capital punishment trials, automatic appeals, and the heightened security on death row with lower staff-to-prisoner ratios. Commuting all death sentences to life in prison would save hundreds of millions of dollars per year in the U.S. and many billions over the coming decades. sources are here: <URL>...",1,Lilieze,"
  
  I wholesomely thank the pro side for presenting their arguments in a clear and concise manner. I shall be rebutting them one by one, and of course, I'll be putting my sources at the end of the post. Ladies and gentlemen, let us proceed:  Pro argues by saying that the death penalty offers social benifits; the first one being peace of mind. I agree that the possibility of a prisoner escaping exists, but statistics show that the odds of that happening are extremely low (1).   '  6,530 people escaped or were AWOL from state prisons. That was a littlemore than one-half of 1 percent of the total population of 1,100,224 state prisoners.'  It doesn't end there. Most of these ""breakouts"" are usually recovered. In average, 10000 escapees result in 9000 of these recovered within the same year (1).   And that was statistical data from 1998  . As for the present? It should be known that prison escapes are declining due to technology breakthrough (2):  As it is seen from this chart, there's in average FOUR escapes per TEN THOUSAND PRISONER (2013 data). That's a number so low, that the chances of being attacked by a prisoner that has escaped from detention are nigh ZERO (You may find the full chart with detailed numbers in the source n°2).

20,"I will be arguing that kids in junior high school should not have cell phones.

He first claims that ""If junior high kids did not have cell phones it would not be very fun for the students."" This is an interesting jump for kids to students, as not all students are kids and not all kids are students -- I think it would be fascinating to find a non-kid as a student in junior high school, but I digress. First, my opponent appears to be suggesting that ""it"" isn't fun for students without cell phones. What is ""it""? School? If it's school, then the obvious response is that (1) school is not intended to be fun; it's intended as a place to hone young minds and equip them with the tools they need to grow and flourish into responsible, intelligent adults (2) why would you want to use a cell phone in school, where students are already prone to distraction? It would merely enable students to hold background conversations while they should be listening to their teachers and allow them to, if they so choose, cheat and (3) does not contribute to their learning in any way -- if it did contribute, Pro has not provided us with how it does, so we must assume that it dos not. There's also the point that ""fun"" is subjective and some students may find school fun, any way, simply because they love to learn. I happened to be one of these kids, actually. If Pro is simply making a general statement that having cell phones is fun, then the same basic reasoning applies: (1) fun is subjective (2) fun is not an argument unto itself; just because something is fun doesn't mean you should do it. For instance, toilet-papering a house is fun, but that doesn't mean that I should do it (3) it is possible to have fun without a cell phone (4) you can't exactly miss what you have never been exposed to, so saying that ""it would not be fun"" is simply unfounded (5) the negative ramifications -- cheating, distractions, etc. -- outweigh the benefits. Pro then claims that cell phones would be useful tools, but gives us only one example: communication. First, to communicate with whom? Their friends while they are still in class? I've demonstrated why this is potentially dangerous. How about with their parents? This is ostensibly plausible, but not only is there not a need for it -- in junior high school, many students either take the bus home, carpool with their friends, or have their parents pick them up, anyway -- but the negative ramifications, again, outweigh the benefits. Communication during the school day merely invites problems, especially when we're discussing junior high school students, who are by definition young and immature. Now that I have refuted my opponent's contentions, I will offer my own: 1. Junior High Students are Young and Immature This merely goes without saying, and people can look back to their junior high days when they were about 11, 12, or 13 and consider what they did when they were in school. This is a matter of trusting these children with a device that is potentially dangerous and could potentially cost their parents quite a pretty penny. 2. Monetary Cost-Benefit Analysis Cell phone bills are VERY expensive. While it could be ""fun"" to have a cell phone -- again, fun is subjective -- there is no evidence whatsoever that it is NECESSARY. Young children do not need a fun for communication or for any other reason because they are still minors and their parents still provide for them, so this is simply a waste of money for their parents, many of whom are already struggling amid this economy. This also gets to the point about maturity. Some phone plans -- mine, for instance, because I'm a poor PhD student who effectively lives in the Stone Age -- charge per text. Therefore, the kids are left either without texting, which takes the ""fun"" out of it, or because they're immature and disobedient to authority, they opt to text anyway even if their parents asked them not to, and cost their parents quite a lot of money. 3.

21,"While I agree that there is merit to the idea of pedophilia being punishable by life sentences, I strongly object to my opponent's logial backing for this idea; his argument can best be summed up as, ""pedophilia is similar to homosexuality. Homosexuality is not based on choice, so neither is pedophilia. If pedophilia is not based on choice, then once a criminally-inclined pedophile, always a criminally-inclined pedophile."" In reality, the argument is about the possibility of ""reforming"" homosexuals. I will first highlight a few sentences of my opponent's argument in particular: ""A bi-sexual clearly makes a choice as to their preference on any given day."" Actually, no, a bisexual is attracted to both in general (sometimes leaning towards one gender). It's not a choice of preference, it's an allowance of both - in other words, avoidance of the choice. ""Why is it a homosexual can not be rehabilitated but a pedophile can. There is no scientific logic here. One can only come to the logical conclusion. If a pedophile can be reformed a homosexual can be reformed. If a homosexual cannot be reformed than a pedophile cannot be reformed."" That's like saying, if an orange can be skinned without using a knife, so can an apple, and if an apple cannot be skinned with a knife, then an orange cannot. My opponent's ""logical conclusion"" relies on a basic similarity between pedophilia and homosexuality that is not there. They do not work on the same system, and what applies to one does not necessarily apply to the other. For one thing, one is based on abuse, while the other is not. For another, one is caused more by issues while another by biological factors - though there is enough controversy about the causes of both for me to not use this argument at the moment. ""If the later is true then a pedophile should never be let out of prison once they commit an act of pedophilia of any kind."" Here's the thing: being a pedophile means being sexually attracted to children. This is a BAD THING, but it is not the same as acting on pedophilic urges. A pedophile is not a criminal nor a morally bad person unless they either abuse or attempt to abuse children - in other words, it is possible to be sexually attracted to children at the same time as not DOING anything wrong, which would certainly be part of reforming a pedophile. Therefore, sentencing pedophiles to life sentences would be something done based on the magnitude of the crime, NOT on the likelihood of another crime. The main question here is - should somebody be jailed for potential crimes they may commit? Generally speaking, that's what intensive therapy is for. Do I believe that acts of pedophilia should result in life sentences? In some cases, I definitely do. Do I believe that a non-life sentence can be justifiably extended to a life sentence as a precaution? Definitely not. There are already precautions in place for convicted pedophiles - registries, prohibitions, etc. Jail as a precaution is an unacceptable corruption of the justice system. ""It is politics that is separating the homosexuals from the pedophiles with regard to the rehabilitation argument."" No, it's science and logic. I'm going to skimp out on the science here, because any sources we throw at each-other will be immediately rejected (though if my opponent is willing to play that game, I'll certainly join in in round 2). Here's the logic, though. Homosexuality is revolves around a relationship between two consenting adults. Children are in no way involved. Nobody is harmed, unless they haven't taken precautions, but because they're consenting adults, that's their own fault. In other words, homosexuality is victimless. Pedophilia, however, is just another form of rape. That's not politics, that's thinking. ""And it is done so at the expense of the children."" The statement comes immediately following the last one I commented on (""It is politics that is separating the homosexuals from the pedophiles with regard to the rehabilitation argument"") so the point is obvious - homosexuality is harming our children. Again, the reason homosexuality is different from pedophilia is because one of them doesn't involve the rape of children - or any type of rape at all, for that matter.* To say that there is no difference between them in that context is the same as saying that a child is harmed by being aware of alternate lifestyles as much as by being the victim of rape and molestation. That is extremely illogical. It's also an elegant trap - one cannot help but agree with condemning pedophiles (unless one wants to look a pedophile supporter); to agree with life-long sentences for pedophiles is to agree with part of my opponent's argument, so, if one gets caught up in the ""save our children"" hype, one can easily be led to believe that to love our children is to hate homosexuals. My opponent's argument is based two false premises: that pedophilia is a sexual orientation (""If this were true then simple logic dictates that a pedophile is also born that way and they cannot help but be a pedophile""), and that being a pedophile and committing acts of pedophilia are the same thing. The following links in my opponent's logic chain are, therefore, invalid: ""Pedophilia is similar to homosexuality,"" and ""If pedophilia is not based on choice, then once a criminally-inclined pedophile, always a criminally-inclined pedophile."" Should we punish (acts of) pedophilia? Yes.

23,"Final rebuttal: Saying that gender equality fights to harm men is equivalent to saying that racial equality fights to harm whites. Or saying that fighting for sexual equality fights to harm non-LGBT individuals. When, in reality, gender equality (and equality in general) is focused around giving equal rights to both sexes, and eliminating the struggles that are produced from patriarchy. Such struggles include: A) Women being misrepresented in politics. B) Rape of both men by women (out of a sense that men are viewed as people who will always accept and appreciate sex willingly) and women by men (out of a perception that women can be viewed as sexual objects). C) Objectification of women in the media. D) Discrimination against those who slip out of their socio-gender normative, simply because they wish to be more individualistic (Ex: passive gay men being compared to women. Which itself is a main lead for same-sex rape within prisons, as passive gay men (or simply men who don't fit within a tough enough veil of masculinity) become to be seen as easy substitutes to women as sex objects). E) Child abuse by mothers/fathers who force their children to mold into a gender normative (Ex: male children being abused for being to 'effeminate', and female children being abused for being to 'masculine'). F) Slut-shaming, which can lead to depression and suicide (as with the case of Amanda Todd[1]).

  Final rebuttal:  Saying that gender equality fights to harm men is equivalent to saying that racial equality fights to harm whites. Or saying that fighting for sexual equality fights to harm non-LGBT individuals. When, in reality, gender equality (and equality in general) is focused around giving equal rights to both sexes, and eliminating the struggles that are produced from patriarchy.  Such struggles include:  A)   Women being misrepresented in politics.  B)   Rape of both men by women (out of a sense that men are viewed as people who will always accept and appreciate sex willingly) and women by men (out of a perception that women can be viewed as sexual objects).  C)   Objectification of women in the media.  D)   Discrimination against those who slip out of their socio-gender normative, simply because they wish to be more individualistic (Ex: passive gay men being compared to women. Which itself is a main lead for same-sex rape within prisons, as passive gay men (or simply men who don't fit within a tough enough veil of masculinity) become to be seen as easy substitutes to women as sex objects).  E)   Child abuse by mothers/fathers who force their children to mold into a gender normative (Ex: male children being abused for being to 'effeminate', and female children being abused for being to 'masculine').  F)   Slut-shaming, which can lead to depression and suicide (as with the case of Amanda Todd[1]).  Etc., etc.  Thus, as a feminist is against patriarchy, a feminist is also against all of these points stated above.  As for your next few paragraphs until the end of my opponent's 'Five ways feminism has ruined America', that was copy/pasted from this source[2].

24,"I first express my thanks for the arguments, and let me proceed to a final round :) Let me first begin by refuting some of the statements; 1) Let me first clarify and inform that distribution of water is not limited to 'drinking water'or , but rather a distribution to homes through pipes such as water used for bath, dish-washing, toilets, and many other purposes. Therefore, once again water is more than just 'drinking' or 'bottled water' but rather a supply for many tasks we need to do in life. 2) Yes, there are worldwide systems and organizations, but they are insufficient to provide every people with water supplies. If those organizations were so great and so effective, how can the nations and people suffering from unapproachable water be existent? I believe that domestic governmental effort through making the water public works much better and efficient. The failures of water privatization is mentioned in my first round's arguments through the examples Great Britain(developed country), and Tanzania(developing country). Let me provide you with some of the successes that public water supply systems have made; Germany has a public system with very low distribution losses; 100% of the urban areas have access while 97% of the rural areas are granted of access. For both urban and rural areas, over 90% has the high sanitation rate. In Denmark, 100% of the population gets water supplies, with more than 87% of high sanitation rate. For the example of a developing country, we have Costa Rica - nearly 90% or the rural areas are granted access, and with almost all of the urban areas getting the supply as well. These data proves that public water systems are certainly more efficient in providing the public with water with good quality and efficiency. 3) My opponent has stated 'there are places where you can get free water'. However, he/she did not state such specific places, and it is not proved. And EVEN IF there were to be places with free water, still people would have to carry the water they need all the way home - which is very inefficient compared to the water pipe systems. 4) ""people who don't work or don't go out into the world and get a job should not get water"" ; means that if one does not have money or a job, they should not be granted the access to water. However, let's keep in mind that no money and no job is caused from lack of efforts. So what about people that are born in adverse conditions? If they have money, does that mean their water supplies, a vital source, has to be cut? A nation and a government should be ready to provide its people, at least a VERY BASIC LIFE SOURCE, instead of abandoning them. 5) There are certain RIGHTS that are granted to people regardless of their jobs or status in money- such as rights to life, freedom of speech, rights to be protected, rights to vote, and so on. And water is one of those sources that should be granted and be provided by the government. Today, I have proved to you that water should NOT be privatized through suggesting; 1) Explaining the nature and qualities of water being a necessary life source and why it should be provided by the government, 2) Explain the Nature of the private companies and how their preference on profits over people can cause harm, plus the comparison with the public water systems which were successful, 3) Possible environmental harms that can come with privatizing water Plus I believe I have rebutted my opponent successfully. However, I haven't really seen a direct rebuttal to theses arguments from my opponent. Plus, what I have seen in the arguments of my opponents were vague. 1) My opponent firstly misunderstood the privatization of water - when it should have been considering the supply of overall water, my opponent has only considered 'bottled water' which was a very limited topic. 2) He/she was also irresponsible in providing people with fair and equal source of water- and when I pointed out the responsibilities of the government and necessity of water supply, I haven't heard the response to that. 3) 'Worldwide systems and organizations of water' or 'free sources' of water were what my opponent suggested. However, they were not specified. Plus, getting water supplies to everybody from those water systems are very impractical - but my opponent as ignored these factors. 4) I haven't seen any reason from my opponent on WHY companies are more efficient or better in providing people with water sources, or why companies can manage the water systems better without harming the environment. 5) Not just these reasons, but I haven't seen a solid argument or a reasoning in my opponent's arguments, and therefore, I do not exactly know what possible solutions or suggestions that were suggested by my opponent. He/she was merely irresponsible, and while he/she tried to tackle my arguments, because they were vague and illogical, they do not stand.(please refer to my rebuttals) Water, once a gain, is a source that is directly related to the rights of life. And because people should be granted these rights, it should be the government who should be managing the system. My reasons have been proved throughout this debate, and if you care for the people and fair distribution of water, please vote for me!

First of all, school uniforms encourage discipline by making students focus on studying and homework rather than new clothes. In the morning, instead of worrying on different outfits, students can do school related activities like organizing their backpack, double-checking their homework, or studying. Students spend a lot of time thinking about clothing, but now, since they have uniforms, they no longer have to go through tedious shopping or hours of decisions of what to wear. School uniforms also help students resist the urge to buy designer clothing. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, the only time new clothes are nexus are weekends, holidays, and summer break, which is a lot less clothes than the entire school year. Clothes can often be used to define social statuses, but if there are no different clothes, people will have to rely on personality rather than the outfit they are wearing. In schools, some students are poor while others are rich. Poor students may have scholarships in order to afford school and have ragged clothes, while rich students may be supported by very wealthy parents and have expensive, fancy clothes. These completely different types of clothes make a huge difference in their popularity at school. Instead of comparing each others clothes, students can compare each others personality and intelligence, which makes a much larger difference.

27,"Rebuttal to Opening Argument: To begin, I would just like to note that Pro's opening statement is practically a concession. By stating that the resolution is 'Feminism fights to harm men', then saying that you are only arguing against radicalism within the ideology, instead of the ideology itself, it a concession. Also, by only limiting their arguments to the western world, it is again a concession. The resolution is 'Feminism fights to harm men', not 'Radical misandry fights to harm men in the West'. However, I will still continue with my arguments. I. My opponent says that today's society is feminist, when it clearly isn't. The definition of feminism, as provided in my opening argument, is the abolition of patriarchy in favor of gender equality. Even if we were living within a female privileged society, it wouldn't be feminist. Since there is simply a new hierarchy that would've been established (matriarchy) instead of gender equality. II. My opponent bases his first point on an unsourceable event. Saying that you have been the 'victim' of feminists, then speaking about such event isn't a legitimate source. It is completely biased by your view of the event. Even then, these people you speak of aren't exactly the most prominent theorists within feminism. III. My opponent stereotypes that all feminists 'assume that men are predators'. This is a complete association fallacy, just because some feminists have a certain radical quality (misandry) doesn't mean that all feminists have a radical quality (misandry). IV. My opponent did not provide a source to back up point 3. V. There is evidence that shows that the number of women incarcerated has actually increased. The number of incarcerate women has increased fivefold from 2001, partially due to lack of treatment for women who violate laws. Whereas men have more accessability to such treatment.[1][2] VI. Solanas was both mentally insane, and highly criticized by fellow feminists. Solanas suffered physical and sexual abuse from both her father and grandfather[3][4], and would later in life be diagnosed with schizophrenia and be sent to a psychiatric hospital. Betty Friedan, who is noted as writing the famous book, The Feminist Mystique , said that Solanas' views were far too radical and polarizing.[5] VII. The Violence Against Women Act does not imply such by title. The Violence Against Women Act, by title, implies that women have been the main target of domestic violence historically. Women have only started to be seen as actual human beings with feelings rather than just house-keepers since the end of the Victorian Era. Which has been roughly 100 years. Pro also did not provide a source for point 6. VIII. Many of men's problems, such as homicide, are not caused by class struggle within a gender context. The statistics my opponent has mentioned are not directly caused by patriarchy, so why should strict (meaning they only adhere to this one ideology, that being feminism) feminists deal with such an issue? Are some of the numbers involved in those statistics caused by patriarchy, yes. However, saying that they don't care about men because their ideology isn't able to deal with every problem is baseless. However, most of those numbers were caused by different struggles within society, such as poverty. IX. Male rapes are also the result of patriarchy. Male-male rape usually occurs when one male either a) fails to meet the standards that the male gender has set upon them, and are seen as 'weak' and are more likely to be raped, or b) is seen as a means of achieving sexual satisfaction in a place (such as prison) devoid of females (which by many men can be seen as sex objects) and are used as a substitution. Male rape commited by females also occurs due to patriarchy, since males have to meet a standard of 'becoming a man' and are sexually assaulted by women who seek to gain sex out of such under this guise. This itself can actually cause some men to grow up hating women. Many feminist articles have been published in favor of ending male rape and female rape. Even then, it doesn't matter who gets raped more. Feminism is about trying to end patriarchial culture that harms both women and men. What feminists argue for is to stop rape and rape culture in general. X. The last few paragraphs provided by my opponent were just a copy/paste job.[6] Rebuttal to Second Argument: My opponent starts by reposting some of which they already posted in the first argument, please see above for my rebuttals to such. I. A dictionary definition cannot be 'tainted'. The radical feminists you mention are only more 'popular' since media can make more money by creating a story that is completely out of proportion and spread dishonest information than by telling the truth. Ideological definitions don't just 'change', anyone who is a misandrist or believes in feminine supremacy isn't a feminist by the definition I provided, since they obviously don't support gender equality.

28,"I would like to thank my opponent for a great debate. She turned out to be quite the opponent. 1.Popular Vote vs. Equality In order for this to be true my opponent would have needed to substantiate that there was inequality. Heterosexuals and homosexuals have equal rights. Every person has the right to marry one person of the opposite sex. We HAVE equal protection under the law. I am not permitted to have multiple wives, just like a wannabe polygamous is not permitted to have multiple wives. I cannot marry a man, nor can someone who wants to marry a man. I cannot have sex with an animal (at least in my particular province), just like a zoophile cannot. I cannot have sex with children, and neither can a pedophile. This IS the definition of equal. My opponent is comparing gay marriage to African American rights. This is not analogous and therefore irrelevant.

I would like to thank my opponent for a great debate. She turned out to be quite the opponent.  
  
1.Popular Vote vs. Equality  
  
In order for this to be true my opponent would have needed to substantiate that there was inequality. Heterosexuals and homosexuals have equal rights. Every person has the right to marry one person of the opposite sex. We HAVE equal protection under the law. I am not permitted to have multiple wives, just like a wannabe polygamous is not permitted to have multiple wives. I cannot marry a man, nor can someone who wants to marry a man. I cannot have sex with an animal (at least in my particular province), just like a zoophile cannot. I cannot have sex with children, and neither can a pedophile.  
  
This IS the definition of equal.  
  
My opponent is comparing gay marriage to African American rights. This is not analogous and therefore irrelevant. Homosexuality is not innate, but research tends to agree that homosexuality is a learned behavior (1).  
  
Gay marriage should not be nationally imposed because it would have to circumvent our current legal system in order to do so.

These black adopted children actually do worse than their white and east-asian counterparts, once again showing that there is an underlying genetic hierarchy.

I shall leave it to our readers to decide whether pro has successfully rebutted my arguments (round 2) or not. Let's begin. Pro has stated that ""those who kill or otherwise commit heinous crimes against innocent civilians are the cancer of society."" I am not going to focalize on the cancer tumour analogy claiming that it does not fit in order to rebut his argument. In fact, I shall be embracing it and using it against pro. Read thoroughly: Before doing that, I shall adress the ideology of ""punishment & vendetta"" which states that that justice, or/and the law has the duty to punish criminals and to get rid of an individual that has harmed society and may harm it again, and that it has to avenge victims of heinous crimes. I believe the morality behind this ideology is corrupted and misses the true goal and design of justice. But, it goes on, 'it is necessary that society should avenge the victims, that society should punish.' - Neither: To avenge is of the individual, to punish is of God, and Society/law/justice is between the two in the hiearchy. Society's duty is to correct and ameliorate. Not to punish, and not to avenge. You treat crime as a malady, as a sickness. That's the right way to do it. But the sickness, or the cancer as you put it, doesn't reside in the criminal or in the crime he has commited, but instead resides on the origin of the crime, or in other words the motives of the person and what has lead that said person to commit murder, steal etc. Crime has always existed. And it still exists. It's clear that we are dealing with crime the wrong way, focalizing on the crime instead of the source of the crime. Because this is where your analogy goes wrong: research done on medicine, and the scientific breakthroughs achieved in that field aren't to develop new ways to physically extract cancer from the body, they are done to develop ways of eradicating the source of the disease altogther, to make us immune from it, to heal us from it. Sickness has to be treated with care, with attention, and most importantly it must be studied thoroughly, it has to have its source identified, eradicated. Our readers must have noticed by now that I am centering the debate on not the crime or the criminals themselves, but on the source of the said crime, because it is a requirement in order for us to eradicate crime. Just like how you deal with sickness in medicine, you have to go to a prison, and observe the inclination of each prisoner, gather data, understand why person A was lead to murder that innocent civilian, or why person B had to steal from that store. Are criminals actually guilty, or is it that the society itself is guilty? Because yes, society itself bears a part of guilt whenever an innocent civilian has been murdered. Fact is: poverty and misery leads to crime, and to get rid of crime is to get rid of poverty. Poverty is justice denied: this needs to change. (1 & 2). No matter how many people you hang, crime is never going to stop, because the problem lies on society and on government, and not on the individuals themselves. To kill an individual for something he has no power over is senseless, defies the bases of justice, and is straight up barbary! Educate, enlighten, heal, and correct the heads, and you will not need to cut them. Not to mention mental sickness and psychology, but perhaps I can leave that to another round since I am lacking space to properly develop my ideas.

During the Stalingrad battle the best the Western Allies could do was to finally drive German and Italian forces out of Africa after three long years of fighting. During Kursk? The Western Allies were playing fiddle in Sicily. And what were the Soviets doing when the U.S., Britain, and Canada were trying their best to carve out a larger beachhead at Normandy? The Soviets were crushing the German Army Group Center, its biggest concentration of forces. The U.S. and Britain would not have even launched their invasion of Normandy if the Soviets had not already broken the back of Germany on the Eastern Front and ensured that it was militarily crippled. D-Day was most certainly not the turning point of the war and its biggest importance was to ensure that the Soviets wouldn't""t end up ""liberating"" France.

Anybody who doesn't realize that the war was decided on the Eastern Front and that everything else was a sideshow by comparison doesn't know that much about World War II.

[3] At Kursk, the Germans suffered 250,000-300,000 casualties. [4] As for the Western Allied bombings, they had no effect on the outcome of the war. While the Western Allies were bombing and terrorizing German cities and destroying factories, the Soviets were bombing the German front lines along a 2,000 mile long front. Britain promised to open a second front in 1942, yet failed to do so. Then Churchill said he would open a second front in France in 1943, and once again failed to do so. While the Western Allies stood on the sidelines until 11 months before the war ended, the Soviet were killing Germans in the millions on the eastern front. [5] Historians generally agree that there were three turning points in the war: The Battle of Moscow - ensured Germany would not win a quick war on its terms.

Many animals kept in zoos are in there to preserve their particular race, when an animal(bird) etc, etc is kept in a safe, clean environment it is more likely to thrive than in the wild. Which means that in some cases, zoos are actually helping species regain their ability to carry on breeding and making bigger their race. A common argument to this is that animals can breed freely in the wild without becoming extinct. This is wrong because under the current influence of man this actually is not possible for some species, eg elephants, could become extinct as they are wanted for many things, skins, tusks and so on. Another example would be tuatara,s if it weren't for zoos and recreational parks we wouldn't ever be able to see them.

61,"Note: PRO and I obviously have differing views of misconduct. This debate is about whether this idyllic idea SHOULD be put into action, not whether it can be put into action or whether it should be America's number one top priority. No, this debate is about whether or not we should put tolerance-inducing, Islamic advertisements on television. I never said anything about priority, this is about practicality. I agree that spreading tolerance to everyone is an idyllic goal we should work toward, but that is not part of the resolution. The resolution explicitly states: ""Islamic advertisements on the television."" I don't know where you are going with this, but this holds little or no relevance whatsoever. The problem with PRO is his complete lack of understanding of the word, 'should' Should, by definition, implicates necessity. This means that, for something to be sufficiently categorized under this word, it must have a compelling degree of necessity. This leads to the following question: What determines necessity? I made two approaches to this question. The first approach outlined in round 1 was generic. I simply took the costs of the proposition (monetary cost, opportunity cost, etc.) and weighed it with the benefits. The sacrifice necessary to achieving the goal of removing intolerance in America does not outweigh the costs. There are simply better alternatives and the proposition therefore should not be implemented. To drive this nail home, let me provide a more extreme example to show how this line of logic works: -Most of us want to attain world peace and fix our progressing environmental destruction -Option: remove the human race -Cost >Benefit First off, this is exactly what PRO does. He presents a positive goal, tolerance, but limits our option to TV ads. Second: As you can see, this is judgment is subjectively made; others can say benefit > cost and who's to argue that? It all boils down to our personal world perspectives (your opinion!!). This connects to my second approach: there is no objectivity, therefore nothing can be a necessity. My opponent's response to the second approach is an appeal to humanity's evolutionary instincts of survival and reproduction. The problem: Why is that important in an objective sense? It is only important to us because we personally want to survive and be happy, but in the grander scheme (if there is one), it doesn't matter. Everything lives, everything dies. As long as all of existence continues moving along the fulcrum of time, everything that we see right now, the stars, the sun, the moon, the earth, etc. will eventually disappear. What is humanity but an insubstantial speck when compared to infinity? Nothing is important. You die, who cares? Humanity does because humanity thinks its own personal subjective desires to survive and reproduce are important for some odd reason. They are not. Try as you might, you cannot prove humanity's necessary existence. Please refer to the 'chain' in round 1 if you are still confused. It can't get any clearer. In response to my blurb questioning the capabilities of the TV ad method (""do you really think 30 seconds of promotional advertisements would be able to reverse that?""), PRO provides possible messages for these ads: ""Healthy Muslims - Putting the slim back into Muslim!

[1] <URL>...",1,Beginner,"
  
Note: PRO and I obviously have differing views of misconduct.  
This debate is about whether this idyllic idea SHOULD be put into action, not whether it can be put into action or whether it should be America's number one top priority.  
No, this debate is about whether or not we should put tolerance-inducing, Islamic advertisements on television. I never said anything about priority, this is about practicality. I agree that spreading tolerance to everyone is an idyllic goal we should work toward, but that is not part of the resolution. The resolution explicitly states: ""Islamic advertisements on the television.""  
I don't know where you are going with this, but this holds little or no relevance whatsoever.  
  
The problem with PRO is his complete lack of understanding of the word, 'should'  
Should, by definition, implicates necessity. This means that, for something to be sufficiently categorized under this word, it must have a compelling degree of necessity.  
This leads to the following question: What determines necessity?  
I made two approaches to this question.  
The first approach outlined in round 1 was generic. I simply took the costs of the proposition (monetary cost, opportunity cost, etc.) and weighed it with the benefits. The sacrifice necessary to achieving the goal of removing intolerance in America does not outweigh the costs. There are simply better alternatives and the proposition therefore should not be implemented.  
To drive this nail home, let me provide a more extreme example to show how this line of logic works:  
-Most of us want to attain world peace and fix our progressing environmental destruction  
-Option: remove the human race  
-Cost >Benefit  
First off, this is exactly what PRO does. He presents a positive goal, tolerance, but limits our option to TV ads. Second: As you can see, this is judgment is subjectively made; others can say benefit > cost and who's to argue that? It all boils down to our personal world perspectives (your opinion!!). This connects to my second approach: there is no objectivity, therefore nothing can be a necessity.  
My opponent's response to the second approach is an appeal to humanity's evolutionary instincts of survival and reproduction. The problem: Why is that important in an objective sense? It is only important to us because we personally want to survive and be happy, but in the grander scheme (if there is one), it doesn't matter. Everything lives, everything dies.

""Healthy Muslims - Putting the slim back into Muslim!

In closing, I would like to offer a brief summary of this debate, as well as addressing new points that Con brought up in the final round. Con makes a single argument, stating: ""I believe it is very clear Pro has an out-dated clich view on the Muslim face veil."" Does Con provide any source for this claim? The Qu'ran. What does the Qu'ran say? Absolutely nothing about the face veil, because the Qu'ran does not require it to be worn. That is the key to this debate. The ""authoritative Islamic sources"" that Con repeatedly refers to is the Qu'ran. But the Qu'ran does not argue in favor of the face veil! It explicitly says that we should not compel anyone to do anything. The Qu'ran in essence gives people freedom from having to wear the face veil. Con admits this point. Take a look at Con's final quote from Tawakul Karman: ""Man in the early times was almost naked, and as his intellect evolved he started wearing clothes. What I am today and what I'm wearing represents the highest level of thought and civilization that man has achieved, and is not regressive. It's the removal of clothes again that is regressive back to ancient times."" Exactly! Clothes represent something. That was what I argued. I am not saying we should be naked. I'm saying that what you wear matters. If someone wears a Nazi uniform, and is a neo-Nazi, they will not be able to integrate in Western society. Notice that the majority of Western nations outlaw Nazism of any kind. Holocaust denial is outlawed as well. I have argued what the face veil represents: female seclusion and patriarchal tyranny. Con has not adequately challenged the historical and academic sources I have provided. I want to make sure readers understand what Con has argued. Con has NOT argued that the face veil does not represent female seclusion. Con has argued that Islam does not require that women wear the face veil. So what? That is not at issue. What Islam permits or does not permit is irrelevant; what is relevant is what the face veil ITSELF represents historically, culturally, and socially. Asking if Islam permits it is irrelevant, what is relevant is whether the West would permit it. Given the negative Western view for patriarchal tyranny, it is clear the face veil poses a problem for anyone attempting to integrate in the West, as the West would not accept the face veil as a component of its culture. It simply would not happen, given what the veil represents. That's all there is to say.",1,FourTrouble,"

I am slightly unhappy with this as unless CON was given no prior warning of his final, he should have been able to work out that rounds 4 and 5 will be during his exams and therefore should have not accepted the challenge. On the question of my sources, let me say that while my opponent has relied solely on news paper articles; I have used evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals for the my main points (the adoption studies and most of the IQ figures) and used news paper articles for things such as SAT scores which are less controversial and did not, in my opinion, need much proving.

Philippe Rushton was merely for readers who wished to have a more in depth look at the subject and I did not quote anything from it other than that there were many papers showing that there was an IQ difference (I quoted once such paper in the next round and also copied a table from it) To reiterate my arguments: there have been numerous studies confirming that there is an IQ/intelligence hierarchy and this fact is generally accepted in the scientific community. However, what scientific researchers do not agree on is whether this IQ difference is 100% environment or if it has a genetic factor to it as well. (Please remember that all I have to do is to prove that there is a 1% genetic factor and i'll have proven that some races are at a - inherent - intellectual advantage.) To prove that this IQ gap is not entirely down to environment I have quoted many trans-racial adoption studies involving blacks and mongloids. These have shown that even when adopted into white families the mongoloids still score higher than average on the IQ test (around 108); my opponent, at this point, said that the adopting families are obviously well-off if they can afford to adopt and and that wealth is negatively correlated to racism so these Korean children will have an environmental advantage. I responded that if this were the case then black children who were adopted by white parents must have even bigger of an environmental advantage since there is a longer history of racism towards blacks so they should score at least as well as the Koreans - however they do not, and what is more they actually score BELOW the national average (around 87) showing that environment cannot account for everything.

79,"First of all, when society has raised the driving age even to 17, overall rate of teens killed in crashes in New Jersey has been consistently lower than in some nearby states according to various studies. Why shouldn't we raise it to 18 to reduce even more deaths? The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, which consider consequences, does not fully mature until at the age of 25. The reason that the driving age isn't 25 is that driving is necessary to go to college at the age of 18. The age of majority indicates the end of adolescence and people who reach this age are regarded as adults and are held to be responsible for their actions. Therefore 18 is better than 16, because people who are 18 are regarded as adults and have more experience than 16-year-olds with a more developed dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. I have never proposed a strict system in which one can only get a license at age 18. By raising the driving age to 18, I meant by learners will still be granted their provisional license from 16 or 17, but will need a year to pass a beefed-up test, which means the minimum age at which a new driver could realistically go out on his or her own will be 18. The people under the age of 18 will have to be supervised by an adult such as a legal guardian or parent. ""When the individual could show that they are mature and a capacity to drive responsibly,"" means that children and teenagers aged 10-14 can be mature and show that they can drive with responsibility. If such a system was implemented, I would use it as my advantage to learn how to drive at the age of 10-14. I'm sure our society wouldn't like the idea of people ages 10-15 driving on the streets. Anyone can show maturity at any age, but it takes more than 1/2 of the people with large amounts of maturity to lower or keep the driving age. ""Risk statistics based on age seems overall a rather lousy way to give a basis for qualification for things that very widely based on individual."" Does that mean that very intelligent or mature teenagers ages 10-14 can be trusted with adult rights that include binding contract, buying stocks, voting, buying and/or consuming alcoholic beverages, driving motor vehicles on public roads, and marrying without obtaining consent of others or any restrictions? Source: <URL>... ""We could just implement a brain scan for every individual attempting to get a license to see if they are developed enough to qualify."" In theory, it could work. However, Giedd says that ethical crossroad is too radical to seriously consider today. ""We are just at the threshold of this,"" he says. Do you think every parent is going to agree to have their teenagers take a brain scan to determine whether he or she was neurologically fit to drive? What if the brain scan says that his or her brain isn't developed enough? How will their parents feel about the results? Ignoring the ethical crossroad, if the brain scans were implemented today, there would be no reason to raise the driving age to 18. But we can't because of ethics, and we need to raise the driving age to 18 now to save lives, until the day when brain scans can be implemented. Source: <URL>... Anecdotal evidence is unreliable, considered untrustworthy or untrue, or does not warrant the conclusion. According to your personal anecdote, you have no friends or relatives that can drive the car for you. Your situation is reasonable except with the fact of the age. What if you were 8-12 and your mother became sick? What if you were a baby and your mother was so weak after driving? The same circumstances could apply to any age and it seemed that you didn't seek for any help. Putting gas in the tank is only part of the cost of having an automobile. Rates for teens are higher for a variety of reasons, including a lack of experience on the road. Insurance as a concept is based on the idea of sharing expenses among a group of individuals where the risk is calculable. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. That factor naturally translates into higher rates for youthful drivers. Therefore if the driving age was raised to 18, auto insurance rates would be lowered for all drivers. Source: <URL>... I didn't intend the global warming argument to be a contention, because it is ultimately not a reason to deny individuals who could handle driving a car the ability to do so. However, you would notice that we don't have the most fuel efficient cars invented yet and cars that are the most fuel efficient are not relatively cheap. Less cars on the road, less air pollution, might slow down global warming. May not stop global warming, but it will help. ""Heavy drinking is encouraged and in which peer pressure is on to also encourage faster driving then we are more likely to have individuals conditioned to drive poorly."" That is exactly the reason why we need to raise the driving age to 18, because adults are more mature and can deal with peer pressure better than teenagers age 16 or under. That's also why teens often seem more impetuous than adults. In making decisions, they rely more on the parts of their brain that control emotion. Source: <URL>...",1,Dnick94,"

""When the individual could show that they are mature and a capacity to drive responsibly,"" means that children and teenagers aged 10-14 can be mature and show that they can drive with responsibility. If such a system was implemented, I would use it as my advantage to learn how to drive at the age of 10-14. I'm sure our society wouldn't like the idea of people ages 10-15 driving on the streets. Anyone can show maturity at any age, but it takes more than 1/2 of the people with large amounts of maturity to lower or keep the driving age.  
  
""Risk statistics based on age seems overall a rather lousy way to give a basis for qualification for things that very widely based on individual.""  
  
Does that mean that very intelligent or mature teenagers ages 10-14 can be trusted with adult rights that include binding contract, buying stocks, voting, buying and/or consuming alcoholic beverages, driving motor vehicles on public roads, and marrying without obtaining consent of others or any restrictions?

""We could just implement a brain scan for every individual attempting to get a license to see if they are developed enough to qualify."" In theory, it could work. However, Giedd says that ethical crossroad is too radical to seriously consider today. ""We are just at the threshold of this,"" he says. Do you think every parent is going to agree to have their teenagers take a brain scan to determine whether he or she was neurologically fit to drive? What if the brain scan says that his or her brain isn't developed enough? How will their parents feel about the results? Ignoring the ethical crossroad, if the brain scans were implemented today, there would be no reason to raise the driving age to 18.  
But we can't because of ethics, and we need to raise the driving age to 18 now to save lives, until the day when brain scans can be implemented.

Anecdotal evidence is unreliable, considered untrustworthy or untrue, or does not warrant the conclusion. According to your personal anecdote, you have no friends or relatives that can drive the car for you. Your situation is reasonable except with the fact of the age. What if you were 8-12 and your mother became sick? What if you were a baby and your mother was so weak after driving? The same circumstances could apply to any age and it seemed that you didn't seek for any help.  
  
Putting gas in the tank is only part of the cost of having an automobile. Rates for teens are higher for a variety of reasons, including a lack of experience on the road. Insurance as a concept is based on the idea of sharing expenses among a group of individuals where the risk is calculable. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. That factor naturally translates into higher rates for youthful drivers. Therefore if the driving age was raised to 18, auto insurance rates would be lowered for all drivers.

I didn't intend the global warming argument to be a contention, because it is ultimately not a reason to deny individuals who could handle driving a car the ability to do so. However, you would notice that we don't have the most fuel efficient cars invented yet and cars that are the most fuel efficient are not relatively cheap. Less cars on the road, less air pollution, might slow down global warming. May not stop global warming, but it will help.  
  
""Heavy drinking is encouraged and in which peer pressure is on to also encourage faster driving then we are more likely to have individuals conditioned to drive poorly.""  
  
That is exactly the reason why we need to raise the driving age to 18, because adults are more mature and can deal with peer pressure better than teenagers age 16 or under. That's also why teens often seem more impetuous than adults. In making decisions, they rely more on the parts of their brain that control emotion.
