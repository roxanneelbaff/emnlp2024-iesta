3,"You've made some valid points about the smoothness of the glides and the changes in position being powerful. However, I must say, looking at the video provided you will see that popping also requires a smooth and flowing glide system. This gliding system is the basics (after actual popping of course). You must know how to glide due to the fact that while popping you can't just simply walk around, your movements must be smooth. Since most of the Melbourne Shuffle is centered on gliding I would have to say that your argument is invalid (regarding gliding). You've also said ""...it's captivating visual effect on the audience."". Can you honestly watch the video I have provided and say that it does not capture the visual effect of any audience? You've also said ""...each glide matching the timing of the bass."" When popping you must be able to dance not only to the bass but also to the main synth pattern. You've mentioned that it is a fast paced dance style, Melbourne shuffle. So is popping, if you refer to the video, at the time 1:25 you will see that popping is also faced pace. You've also said ""Also, it matches the style of accompanying music (usually hard trance or hardstyle) perfectly..."" Are you implying that genre of music is made specifically for Melbourne Shuffle? If you are I ask of you to post a song that I will personally pop to, to show you that it is possible to pop to any genre of music. tl;dr - You can pop to anything, any pace/bpm, requires gliding smoothly, captures attention, speed adjustable, challenge accepted - I will pop to any song.",1,Garipa,"

4,First a light saber can not die and the light saber can not be paralyzed. My second argument is that the emperor has a large army full of a variety of soldiers. The emperor also has a spaceship that blows up planets. The emperor also has the force and Vader. So I believe the star gate army will lose to the empire.,1,WeirdJohn12,"

5,"That's pretty sick, I'll try my best. You're strapped to bed. Your mom comes in, but she's naked. She comes up and hits you in the face, and then she hits you again but this time it like totally stings. You say ""Why mom?"" but before you can go on she is rubbing her titties in your face. You try to struggle but then your dad (who has AIDS) comes in and starts sodomizing you. After your mom and dad are done with you and you've been infected, they just let you be for a few months and let the AIDS kick in. Afterwards, when the disease has kicked in, your mom comes back and starts poking you in the eyes with a rusty needle until your blind. After that's done your dad rips out all your nails after shoving bamboo chutes up them. Your dad then calls ""Jimmy the mobster"" who breaks your kneecaps with a baseball bat and then forcibly sodomizes you again. After giving you like 2 hours to recover, mom and dad return to sprinkle you with drop of sulfuric acid, which literally sears through the skin and eats through organs. Mom and Dad do this until you die, but not before calling over a group of japanese men to perform one last act of bukkake. Good luck to Pro!",1,OMGJustinBieber,"
