0,"1 - In the example of ALFA corporation, Pro assumes that it would be beneficial for the corporation to utilize the other 75 acres of land. To use those acres, ALFA would have to incur expenses such as planting, watering, pesticides, consulting, harvesting, processing, and distribution of final product. These expenses are only offset, resulting in profit, if there is sufficient demand for the product. If there isn't enough demand, ALFA will incur a loss by using those extra acres. Why then is ALFA corporation only using 25 acres? I can only think of two reasons: There isn't enough demand to justify planting more crops, or ALFA corporation doesn't have the capital to carry the expenses through harvest. In the first case, taxing ALFA corporation won't do any good, in fact the tax would hurt a corporation that is already running below capacity due to poor economic conditions. In the second case, taxing ALFA corporation would only contribute to their capital problems, making future expansion more difficult. 2 - In the example of the two apartment complexes, there is obviously a reason for the second complex to have been built. Demand drives an economy, and the current demand trends in housing call for larger, open floor plans, modern appliances, modern fixtures, higher ceilings, and other such modern attributes to homes. Many people will choose to pay more to live in a newer, larger, modern apartment than a cheaper, older apartment. This demand is what causes new complexes to be built when others are still vacant. The only way to change the natural supply/demand process of the free market would be to take away the freedom and force people to move into existing complexes. Taxing the empty apartments would only hurt those who are trying to turn a profit in an area of housing where there is less demand. It would do nothing to incentivize people to consider housing that they don't desire. 3 - Pro states that increasing taxes on unused land and apartments would somehow stimulate the economy, without giving any reasons as to how such taxes would increase demand. Without demand, there can be no profit. I assert that unused apartments, homes, and land should not be taxed, because doing so only adds additional financial burden in an economy with low demand and struggling balance sheets.",1,TheTruthAnalyst,"

1,"My thanks to my opponent for accepting the debate. I would like to open, by drawing out attention to the country of Iceland. In 2008, Iceland's recession, --part of string of countries that ended up in hot water due to their reliance on horrendous banking policies-- was not only the worst Iceland had ever seen, but also the deepest in terms of debt versus anywhere else on the planet. Austerity had its advocates there. ""Cut our social programs! End our welfare! reign in our universal health care coverage!"" they cried. But the Icelandic people wisely chose to reject this 'race-to-the-bottom' style of thinking. Paradoxically, by going into MORE debt briefly in order to stimulate their economy and salvage their social safety net, Iceland has bounced back stronger than ever into a position of economic leadership in the region. <URL>... By contrast, let us look to Greece, who, unlike Iceland, has been dragged kicking and screaming through austerity measures by the IMF (who loaned money Austerity-Anchor free to Iceland) and is still in horrific depression as a result. The complete lack of consumer spending has not magically resulted in the generation of new savings, nor have the deep cuts in social spending somehow translated to a strong and balanced budget. Rather these measures have utterly demolished both the prospects and morale of the Greek people. <URL>... Both these cases underscore the argument I laid out in my opening statement: Trying to focus an economy on being debt-free in the short-term in the hopes of boosting loan-confidence and savings, while it may bring debt down in the short term, does nothing to actually fuel economic growth or end recession. By contrast, a focus on stimulus, while raising debt in the short term, allows for enough financial gain in the long term to reduce or eliminate debt with the extra money that will eventually be generated. To break the whole thing down in very simplistic terms, stimulus can function as the kick-start to get an economic motor running, and once running, that motor will eventually cover its own motion. Austerity generates nothing but moralistic, self-righteous smarm.",1,voxprojectus,"

2,"First to rebut, I think there are a great many gaps and a lack of correlation in many of your arguments. Let's go through it, shall we? 1. You assert that balancing the budget would result in financial institutions having more savings. Rebuttal: A government indulging in Austerity in order to meet the goal of a balanced budget takes away both savings AND spending power from the poorer segments of the population. With less money in food stamps or subsidized housing, the impoverished citizen is forced to withdraw money from Financial institutions in order to make these ends meet. Either that or rely on yet more credit to cover the gaps. On top of that, these individuals would have less money to spend on goods and services, and the providers of those goods and services in turn have less to save. Thus, with less savings from both the upper and lower end of the economy, financial institutions would have less saved and less to invest in production. 2. Savings could be utilized for expensive purchases, such as cars and houses. Rebuttal: Again, how does balancing a budget result in people having more money to save? We're talking about funds that government uses to typically subsidize people's lives so they don't have to spend money. If, in the course of austerity, people suddenly have to live without public transportation, food or housing help, where does their extra money come from? 3. The NBER's statement on the benefits of Capital Accumulation are not partnered with Austerity. In fact a recent article by the same group very much argues the opposite of that: <URL>... ""The Austerity Myth: Gain without Pain"". 4. Your conclusion rings hollow in the face of both examples I have provided. Please address them. In the meantime, I extend all arguments. And my thanks for your response.",1,voxprojectus,"

3,"Both my opponent and I agree that to win this debate, one must show who will bring about the most possible suffering .Furthermore, all of the benefits of keeping aid (havingPakistan crumble) that I will state now will not be possible if we were to suspend assistance. My opponent hasn't provided any argumentation yet to as how exactly removing aid will harm Pakistan. H. Mahood, a PhD scholar and lecturer writes: ""Foreign aid is bad for political process as natural resources become bad for natural resource-rich countries...Foreign aid and natural resources have the common features of exploitation by corrupt politicians."" [1]. He also writes: ""Reinnika and Svensson studied the survey of primary schools in Uganda and found that only 13% foreign aid for education reached to the schools and rest was exploited. Knack documented the pattern of corruption with foreign aid, as aid dependence increased, accountability would decrease, domestic corruption to disburse the aid fund would increase and there would be weak institutions. Knack and Rahman found that the greater the foreign aid with respect to GDP the greater would be corruption levels and weak democratic and bureaucratic performance."" [1] As more foreign aid flows in, corruption in the government will increase. Overall, foreign aid has little to no impacts on the countries. Lack of good coordination, high transaction costs, and failing government alignment has led to the undermining of the sustainability of national development plans, the distorting of priorities, and the diversion of scarce resources and/or establishing uncoordinated service delivery systems [2]. Peter Heller, a Deputy Director of the IMF""s Fiscal Affairs Department, says: ""Maureen Lewis on HIV/AIDS programs notes obvious dependency issues, including a reduced incentive for aid recipients to mobilize domestic resources; the potential for economic agents""whether in the government or the NGO sector""to tailor their priorities to the perceived interests of donors; a reduced pressure for governments to address inefficiencies in how public services are delivered; resistance by governments to a greater private sector role in delivering services; and the potential for increased corruption and rent seeking. Finally, countries relying heavily on aid inflows give up significant autonomy in decision making on budget priorities."" Basically, foreign aid takes away from the responsibility of the government, inviting laziness, corruption, and bad decision making. Also, aid allows bad governments to stay in power. ""In some circumstances external aid can fill so great a proportion of civilian needs for food, shelter, safety, and health services that significant local resources are thereby freed up for the pursuit of warr. This economic substitution effect of aid has a further political impact. When external aid agencies assume responsibility for civilian survival, warlords tend to define their responsibility and accountability only in terms of military control. Even if they started with a commitment to peacetime political leadership, as the international aid community takes over the tasks of feeding and providing health services and shelter for civilians these military-oriented leaders increasingly relinquish responsibility for civilian welfare. They focus on military ends and, over time, define their roles solely in terms of physical control (and the violent attainment and maintenance of that control). As this occurs, warriors struggling for victory over space and people lose all interest and competence in civilian affairs and become increasingly ill prepared to assume broad, responsible leadership in a post war period"" [3]. Self-explainable - aid shifts the responsibility of leaders and allow them to wage war. ""...development aid can exacerbate social tensions, encourage bad policy making, make governments less accountable to voters, intensify competition for resources, and feed processes of structural violence in a country, ultimately empowering the very elites who benefit from exploiting marginalized segments of the country..."" [4/5]. In Rwanda's situation, the aid that was sent directly resulted in a corrupt and genocidal government slaughtering an ethnicity. A study found that reliance on local resources is actually more beneficial then foreign aid [ Aid delivered bythe US Government will only increase rent-seeking and cripple economic development. In fact, aid leads to dependency and hinders the development of the economy. It is likely that Pakistan's condition will improve after we withdraw aid. Pakistan is also not an ally. There are many cases where Pakistan's actions have proved that they are not allies. An example would be the IPI pipeline. The general plan to build the IPI pipeline would strengthen Iran's importance in gas/energy markets in Asia [5]. Pakistan has tried to perhaps even accelerate the building of the IPI pipeline, while the US have demonstrated their obvious opposition to the pipelines [5]. Pakistan is also becoming increasingly inhospitable to the US due to drone attacks. The general public has grown hostile towards US attacks, because of the many innocent lives lost [6]. Pew Surveys found that 69% of the citizens of Pakistan view the USA as an enemy, and 73% see America as unfavorable. The US public image in Pakistan is obviously bad. Public support for the use of an army to combat extremists have also been steadily declining [7]. However, it is not only Pakistan that has been 'unfaithful'. Pakistani leaders have grown angry at America's support of the quickly growing India [5]. Other accounts include the ""sale of U.S. military hardware and provision of civilian nuclear technology assistance to India"" [5] and Obama's endorsement of a permanent seat in the UN for New Delhi. India is seen as the greatest threat to Pakistan - a majority of 57% [7]. In the eyes of Pakistanis, the USA is teaming up with their greatest enemy. In the end, Pakistan is destined to be our enemy. By continuing to give them aid, we slowly destroy them without ever having to launch an attack. ==Conclusion== 1) Keeping aid will prolong human suffering (and taking away aid will reduce suffering) 2) Pakistan is an enemy, meaning that we wouldn't be hurting an ally.
