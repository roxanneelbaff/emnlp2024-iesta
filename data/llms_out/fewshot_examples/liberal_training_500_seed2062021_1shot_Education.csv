0,"----Counterargument---- My opponent says ""Gum chewing prevents bad breath."" Bad breath is extremely easy to fix. Nowadays, most kids brush their teeth before going to school, so there isn't that problem. Also, kids can chew gum BEFORE school or on their way to school to get rid of bad breath. There is no way kids need to chew gum in school to get rid of bad breath. Besides, within 5 minutes of the school day if the kids were allowed to chew gum, the bad breath would already be gone. ""Gum chewing has been proven to help kids focus."" This is NOT true, though many people wrongly think so. First of all, not enough research has been done to fully prove this is true. Secondly, it does not help you get higher test scores, actually it will distract you from taking the test because you'll be so worried on if it'll help you or not. Knowing the information will get you higher test scores. If gum does anything at all, it is solely based on the placebo effect. Also, when kids chew gum, it distracts the kids next to them that may not be chewing gum. ""People pick up trash after themselves."" So, some people may be respectful to pick up trash. But let me tell you, in school, kids do not pick up their trash. I have plenty of proof since I am in school. Schools that allow gum chewing have gum in the carpet, under desks and chairs, and all over the walls. It is gross. Kids are getting sick because of all the germs from chewed gum all around them. Janitors don't want to clean up all the gum more then anyone else does, yet they are the ones who have to do it. ""People are respectful and can be told to stop if ""smacking"""" First of all, teachers don't always notice that a student is smacking because they are at the front of the room and less likely to hear it. But the other students next to the smacking student are sure to hear it and it is very annoying. Also, if the teacher does notice, the student may stop smacking but then start again a few minutes later. Sadly, students love to play games like this with the teacher. Thirdly, an older student may entirely stop smacking in that class, but since older students switch classes, they will just start again in their next class. This will distract even more kids next to them until the teacher, at the front of the room, hears them. All these distractions and annoyances lower the grades of students that are next to smacking students. ----Conclusion---- I thank my opponent for taking this debate and wait for my opponent's rebuttal.

Euthanasia: Ending the life of an individual suffering from a terminal illness by lethal injection or suspension of medical treatment. *Euthanasia comes from the Greek word Euthanasia, which means good death* <URL>... my opponent has argued ""I think its wrong because it's exactly like murder and it should not be made legal"" Murder:the killing of another human being under conditions specifically covered in law. Euthanasia and murder are very different. When a person gets euthanized, they choose to die. They no longer want to be on earth. When a person gets murdered, it is not their choice, it is the murderer's. Two very different things. My arguments: 1) People who are terminally ill (people who have cancer,etc.) feel that they are going to die soon anyways, and they feel that they no longer need to live. Why do they need to suffer until they die, when they themselves, are ready to die and feel no more pain. I don't know what your beliefs are, but maybe some of the people feel that their pain on earth is over and they need to go to Heaven. 2) The person on their ""deathbed"" may have a poor quality of life. They may have to make multiple hospital visits, and spend money on medication, which means they have very little money. They would also not get to enjoy life, with the suffering, pain, hospital and doctor visits. They may be very depressed that they don't get to live their lives normal, and they may even become jealous of everybody else.

That all said with regards to Africa look at this photo showing Africa and how it was controlled in 1940 <URL>... as you can see Egypt and Sudan main areas Brittan still had control over was surrounded by the axis and as I said before if Germany just kept Brittan busy with bombings and concentrated the bulk of their forces into the Afrika Corps (yes its actually spelled Afrika) lead by Rommel Africa would have fallen easily you have to reamer Hitler barley supplied Rommel and his Afrika Corps which is why Montgomery seemed so powerful he was fighting an under supplied force with limited resources now it Hitler sent supplies to the Afrika Corps would have easily taken over Africa then the middle east. After gathering enough supplies all Germany would have to do is toughen the blockade against Brittan then run and air raid and land invasion at the same time Brittan would only fall in a matter of time as the only reason Brittan was still standing was because they were still being supplied by America. And I hope you know with all the resources that Germany would get by taking the Middle East there economy would be the best in the world. While with Japan yes they were fighting a formidable foe but the thing that ended the Japanese takeover of China was the US launching the Pacific front while Japan had to supply troops to the Pacific and China at the same time stretching their military thinly and due to the Burma road at that point it became inevitable that Japan lost the war but like I said if Japan never launched the attack on Pearl Harbor as I said all Japan would have to do is focus on China and if need be call Germany for help attacking on the west and Japan on the east as the USSR wouldn""t be an issue as Germany would have never attacked and with China taken Japan would have all the resources needed and could get oil from German held middle east and Japan would ship over needed metals to Germany to keep the war machine rolling. And you also bring up Lend lease in which America and Brittan supply the USSR with weapons well that all started in March 11, 1941 after the Soviets declared war on Germany due to German invasion, but as I""m proposing Germany would have never invaded which would lead to lend lease never happening. And as for Australia there would be nothing Brittan could do Blockades would stop aid going to Australia and Brittan would be occupied with its issues with the Germans than helping one of its colonies half way around the world. And while yes you are true Americans don""t take to kindly to being subjugated but if you look in our history you will see the Nazi party had already had placed some roots in the US and with a standing army of only 300,000 the US would be overwhelmed and would lose ground fast as the onslaught form both coasts would cripple the nation. And yes while we know now that Germany, Italy, and Japan could never win due to economic restraints when you look at the scenario I bring up both economies would boom and grow huge with the Nazis controlling the oil fields and the Japanese controlling the Philippian oil fields and Chinese vast mineral reserves. <URL>... <URL>...",1,Hawkeye117,"

While with Japan yes they were fighting a formidable foe but the thing that ended the Japanese takeover of China was the US launching the Pacific front while Japan had to supply troops to the Pacific and China at the same time stretching their military thinly and due to the Burma road at that point it became inevitable that Japan lost the war but like I said if Japan never launched the attack on Pearl Harbor as I said all Japan would have to do is focus on China and if need be call Germany for help attacking on the west and Japan on the east as the USSR wouldn""t be an issue as Germany would have never attacked and with China taken Japan would have all the resources needed and could get oil from German held middle east and Japan would ship over needed metals to Germany to keep the war machine rolling. And you also bring up Lend lease in which America and Brittan supply the USSR with weapons well that all started in March 11, 1941 after the Soviets declared war on Germany due to German invasion, but as I""m proposing Germany would have never invaded which would lead to lend lease never happening. And as for Australia there would be nothing Brittan could do Blockades would stop aid going to Australia and Brittan would be occupied with its issues with the Germans than helping one of its colonies half way around the world. And while yes you are true Americans don""t take to kindly to being subjugated but if you look in our history you will see the Nazi party had already had placed some roots in the US and with a standing army of only 300,000 the US would be overwhelmed and would lose ground fast as the onslaught form both coasts would cripple the nation. And yes while we know now that Germany, Italy, and Japan could never win due to economic restraints when you look at the scenario I bring up both economies would boom and grow huge with the Nazis controlling the oil fields and the Japanese controlling the Philippian oil fields and Chinese vast mineral reserves.

The reason Hitler planed the invasion was due to the failed invasion of Brittan and the need for oil. During that time the USSR was in control of the coccus oil fields a huge source of oil and that""s something Germany needed greatly to keep the war machine going. Instead of doing the logical of doing business with the Soviets Hitler decided on an invasion. If Hitler was any the more wiser Hitler would have continued the shelling of Brittan but diverted the bulk of his forces to Africa to help Rommel and once in control of Africa then Hitler could have moved his forces to the middle east and taken over that area and exploit it for its oil and not have to go to war with the Soviets. The irony here was Hitler originally made the agreement with Stalin because he knew that fighting two fronts was asinine and had looked at the lessons learned from WWI but soon forgot them once he invaded the USSR. The easy thing Hitler could have done was take the Middle East leave the Soviets alone and worry about taking over Brittan. Once Brittan had fallen and was under Nazi control then all Hitler had to do was build up his military bigger and all his resources and wait for the Japanese to finish up with the pacific, which brings me to my next point Pearl Harbor. As we all should know December 7, 1941 the Japanese imperial Navy led a surprise attack on Perl Harbor in an effort to cripple/ destroy the American navel fleet which was stationed there. Admiral Yamamoto lead this attack too soon, I say this due to Japan leading a ground offensive against the Chinese. What Tajo and Yamamoto should have realized and done was finish up the capture and take over of china and then use the resources of China to build more warships, tanks and equipment. Once sufficient resources were built up Japan should have lead an invasion of Sidney, Australia while also then launching an attack on Pearl Harbor and the US bases on the Philippines and get the oil with Australia falling to the Japanese Americas navy defeated then Germany would launch an invasion on the east coast while Japan did the same on the west coast. Yes it would have been a long drawn out fight but the US military in total only numbered 300,000 and with no support from any allied nation as they all fell America would fall within a few months as we would have to build up our industry our military all of which couldn""t happen so easily as the US would be sandwiched on each coast and American industry would be bombed just like what the US and Brittan did during our offence during WWII how we bombed German industry they would do the same to us and it would only be a matter of time till we fell and next would be Russia same technique and soon Germany would own the western world and Japan would own the eastern world.

18,"Throughout my opponent arguments he has shown a number of contradictions which I wish to expose during this round. On one hand my opponent has constantly referred to exit exams just certifying ""basic competence"" and allowing people who fail it to have it ""retaken at regular intervals"". On the other hand in his response to my contention [C] he argues for raising the standard on exit exams. Throughout his arguments he keeps advocating to make tests harder while at the same time making them easier. As I've proven even raising the standards have no effect. The problem is the test themselves. ""Young high school graduates who obtained their diplomas in exit exam states fared no better in the labor market than their peers who obtained their diplomas in other states. These findings held in states with minimum competency exit exams AND in states with higher competency exit exams."" [A] He goes on to claim that stress helps students. I strongly dispute this claim as it has been proven that learning under stressful conditional conditions impairs just that, learning. [1, Figure 2] Pro goes onto to continue to say that the test can ""be repeated many times"". But if a student continues to repeat a test with the sole purpose of passing are they really learning? It becomes this rhythmic process where students just try to learn the answer; A, B, C, or D rather then learn the information. Pro attempts to refute the fact that the exam does not have a significant factor on a students life. Then I ask you about the girl from Minnesota who would've lost an entire year of her life having to repeat a grade she didn't need to because someone messed up grading a test. [B] The statement ""What isn't tested doesn't exist."" is actually quote from my article <URL>... from the previous round, written and sourced by TEACHERS. As I've mentioned throughout my arguments there is reduced funding and time spent on other subjects when there is standardized testing. (Round 1) For the third time I'll repeat that 6% of our employment comes from the arts; it's far to important to ignore. Let me leave you with another quote from that article: ""At our school, third- and fourth-grade teachers are told not to teach social studies and science until March."" Sounds to me like it doesn't exist. [C] ""I previously offered evidence that the high school degree is viewed as meaningless by employers, and it remains meaningless if exit exams do not do their job."" True, but you also ignored my point I put out last round which I'll repeat for you. ""As I've said before 2/3 of students are already taking exit exams, and seeing as you said employers do not think diplomas mean anything, that would seem to support the fact that standardized testing does not mean anything. Simply put: Employers do not think diplomas mean anything. 2/3 of Students with diplomas have had to of passed a exit exam. Therefore employers do not think passing an exit exam means anything."" [D] The problem with tests is that you can't always test what it important. What is important varies from person to person. If I want to become a graphic designer then that is what is important to me. Standardized tests are this ""one size fits all."" mentality that doesn't work in today's schools or economy.

Not only do they privatize schools , but it's ingrained in their culture that they are hard workers. [3] ""I will agree that standardized testing is not the most important element of education."" That's the problem thought. When you have standardized test it becomes the most important element of education. We need to let teachers do what they were hired for. Teacher. And we need to let students do what they should. Learn. Standardized testing impedes on this. I think voters should also note all of my 7 contentions stand while my opponent has infused his 3 contention in rebuttals. Sources [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

Throughout my opponent arguments he has shown a number of contradictions which I wish to expose during this round.  
On one hand my opponent has constantly referred to exit exams just certifying ""basic competence"" and allowing people who fail it to have it ""retaken at regular intervals"". On the other hand in his response to my contention [C] he argues for raising the standard on exit exams. Throughout his arguments he keeps advocating to make tests harder while at the same time making them easier. As I've proven even raising the standards have no effect. The problem is the test themselves. ""Young high school graduates who obtained their diplomas in exit exam states fared no better in the labor market than their peers who obtained their diplomas in other states. These findings held in states with minimum competency exit exams AND in states with higher competency exit exams.""  
  
[A] He goes on to claim that stress helps students. I strongly dispute this claim as it has been proven that learning under stressful conditional conditions impairs just that, learning. [1, Figure 2]  
  
Pro goes onto to continue to say that the test can ""be repeated many times"". But if a student continues to repeat a test with the sole purpose of passing are they really learning? It becomes this rhythmic process where students just try to learn the answer; A, B, C, or D rather then learn the information.  
  
Pro attempts to refute the fact that the exam does not have a significant factor on a students life. Then I ask you about the girl from Minnesota who would've lost an entire year of her life having to repeat a grade she didn't need to because someone messed up grading a test.  
  
[B] The statement ""What isn't tested doesn't exist."" is actually quote from my article   http://www.education.com...   from the previous round, written and sourced by TEACHERS. As I've mentioned throughout my arguments there is reduced funding and time spent on other subjects when there is standardized testing. (Round 1) For the third time I'll repeat that 6% of our employment comes from the arts; it's far to important to ignore. Let me leave you with another quote from that article: ""At our school, third- and fourth-grade teachers are told not to teach social studies and science until March."" Sounds to me like it doesn't exist.  
  
[C] ""I previously offered evidence that the high school degree is viewed as meaningless by employers, and it remains meaningless if exit exams do not do their job.""  
True, but you also ignored my point I put out last round which I'll repeat for you.  
""As I've said before 2/3 of students are already taking exit exams, and seeing as you said employers do not think diplomas mean anything, that would seem to support the fact that standardized testing does not mean anything.  
Simply put:  
Employers do not think diplomas mean anything.  
2/3 of Students with diplomas have had to of passed a exit exam.  
Therefore employers do not think passing an exit exam means anything.""  
  
[D] The problem with tests is that you can't always test what it important. What is important varies from person to person. If I want to become a graphic designer then that is what is important to me. Standardized tests are this ""one size fits all."" mentality that doesn't work in today's schools or economy. Teachers should be free to pass someone if they adequately show they have excel in what's important to them and have shown they have learned. That's the point of school after all isn't it? There are a multitude of ways to do this such as student projects, portfolios, essays, and class discussions.  
  
[E] Responded to in point [D].
