2,"Cross-Examination Response: Question #1: I'm not certain as to how many times Spidey and the Hulk fought, but I do know that their battles typically have no conclusion (due to some outside interference variables getting in the way). In addition, Spider-Man is usually battling a pre-angered Hulk. In spite that unfair advantage, he is usually too fast for the Hulk. I will say that I recall one instance where the Hulk had defeated Spider-man with a thunder clap, but he had been angered significantly (which I'm arguing wouldn't be the case here). Also, let us take note of the following: <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Now although it's true that Spidey was clearly outmatched here, we must keep in mind that as suggested by the Spidey's line about that being the first or second time he fought the Hulk (Spider-man had battled the Hulk as early as the Green Goblin's first appearance, which isn't even past the first 15 issues). Basically, this was at the beginning of his career. He was nowhere near as strong or experienced as he is now. Let us also keep in mind that Spider-Man has been trained by Captain America several times while part of the Avengers. As long as Spider-Man followed Captain America's lessons and applied some of his own experience, we have plenty of reason to conclude that he could make short work of the Hulk like this as well. Of course, when combined with the showing which can be found in my evidence thread, there is no doubt that this is feasible. Question #2: How do you compare Spidey and Hulk in terms of base strength? What is meant by base strength? Unlike the Hulk, there is no variable (anger) which can change Spider-man's strength level. Based on the strength feats I've provided (especially the one where he uses his physical strength to ""support"" the daily bugle) as well as the dialogue between Spider-Man and Iron-Man in ""What if Mary Jane had been shot instead of Aunt May"" comic (Spider-Man is suggested as possible being even stronger and faster than Iron-Man when cutting loose), I'd say easily the 100 ton class (likely higher, but this should serve as a liberal estimate). Though given that someone who is merely at the highest possible level of human normal human strength (Captain America) can possible take down the Hulk and given that Spider-Man has taken lessons from this very same person while being a part of the Avengers (as indicated by Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #1), it really wouldn't even matter if Spider-Man weren't cutting loose. The Hulk's lack of fighting skill and intelligence in general will give Spider-man the win. Question #3: How fast do you think Hulk is compared to Spiderman? At his weakest (base state, hardly angry), likely weaker than a Spider-Man who is cutting loose. Though if made angry enough, I'll be the first to say that Spider-Man stands no chance against him (neither would 90% of the MU). Fortunately, Spider-Man is well aware of the hulk's strength/weaknesses, thus wouldn't allow him the opportunity to get angry enough if given the chance. Question #4: How durable would you say Spidey is compared to Hulk? (Base) Again, at his weakest, less durable. Question #5: What are your thoughts on the regenerative powers of both opponents? (Base) The Hulk's are better. Spider-Man has never been shown as having any potent regenerative abilities that actively work even mid battle. Question #6: How intelligent would you say Peter Parker is compared to Reed Richards, Bruce Banner or Tony Stark? Hank Pym states that Spider-Man is smarter than him: <URL>... I'd say Hank Pym is probably on par with Tony Stark. That said Richards and Banner are certainly above them. I'd say Peter is potentially smarter than Reed Richards and Bruce Banner, but (as Hank Pym points out) doesn't utilize that potential due to crime fighting. At any rate, I believe I know how my opponent intends to use the answer to that question, so let me just stop him in advance by pointing out that if he attempts to start using any form of Hulk other than normal Hulk, I can just as easily cite Cosmic Spider-Man.",1,Logical-Master,"

I was not saying that I must have Social Phobia or General Anxiety Disorder. I was trying to make a point that there are SO MANY other possibilities that my ""symptoms"" show signs of. A MAJORITY of the side effects my opponent listed for cocaine do not relate to me in any way such as changes in blood pressure, heart rates, breathing rates, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, swelling and bleeding of mucous membranes, damage to nasal cavities, and damage to lungs. On top of that, there are other common physical side effects that many people would notice (but don't) if I used cocaine. Short-term cocaine effects include: Increased blood pressure Constricted blood vessels Dilated pupils Mental alertness Increased energy Increased heart rate Decreased appetite Increased temperature ( <URL>... ) If I used crack, my pupils would most definitely be dilated. This is an obvious sign of cocaine use. My opponent has not mentioned this because he has never seen my pupils dilate in such a way. If he said such, it would be clear proof of cocaine use as it is not caused by many other things. My pupils do not dilate and have not dilated because I do not use or used cocaine. ""Social Phobia is caused by problems with neurotransmitters in the brain called dopamine and seretonin."" My opponent makes it seem like this is solid proof. This might not even be true! Although some studies suggest involvement of dopamine and serotonin, other studies have not supported the idea that these two neurotransmitters are related to social anxiety disorder ( <URL>... ). Once again, my opponent does not relay the true idea of my life when he says I, ""have moved from Virginia to Texas last year after your father remarried.""

10,"I have figured out a way to turn this debate from hypothetical to literal. I drop all of my previous points and will now refer my opponent to the video that I have graciously provided. In it is indisputable proof that Sonic will in fact lose to Mario. For those of you unable to view videos for some reason I will offer a commentary of the scenario. It is a video of a match between two level nine computer controlled characters in the video game Super Smash Brothers: Brawl. All of the items have been turned off so that the characters are fighting using only their skills which includes those listed by my opponent for Sonic.

I have figured out a way to turn this debate from hypothetical to literal. I drop all of my previous points and will now refer my opponent to the video that I have graciously provided.  
  
In it is indisputable proof that Sonic will in fact lose to Mario. For those of you unable to view videos for some reason I will offer a commentary of the scenario. It is a video of a match between two level nine computer controlled characters in the video game Super Smash Brothers: Brawl.  
  
All of the items have been turned off so that the characters are fighting using only their skills which includes those listed by my opponent for Sonic. In addition to no items being used they are fighting on a stage that is only a flat surface with no environmental factors that could contribute to their deaths and they both only have one life to work with.

This is exactly like her prior concern for Sasuke as shown in Naruto Part one (the pre Shippuden half of the series) and we know for a fact that she had previously had strong romantic feelings for Sasuke. B) To add, what's most interesting (on the actual page in the link I provide) is that Yamato comments on Sakura's emotions displayed by stating ""It's how strongly you feel for him that counts. Sakura, I can tell just by looking at you that . . . the truth is . . ."" Just before Yamato is able to finish commenting, Naruto is now conscious and Yamato isn't able to say anymore. This can only mean one thing: If Yamato simply wished to point out that Sakura cares about Naruto as a friend, Naruto waking up wouldn't stop him from saying what he had intended to say. After all, what embarrassment or uneasy feelings could come from knowing that another individual acknowledges you as a friend? Both Naruto and Sakura are teammates and do all things friends typically do together, so there is no doubt that friendship between Naruto and Sakura is common knowledge. Clearly, was about to point out far deeper feelings than that of which can be produced from mere friendship; clearly, Yamato was about to point out that Sakura had developed romantic interest in Naruto. #2. THERE IS PLENTY OF REASON TO BELIEVE THAT NARUTO HAS ROMANTIC FEELINGS FOR SAKURA A) First, there is the fact that he flat out states (or rather, thinks) that he has these kinds of feelings for Sakura, as confirmed on the bottom right panel on the page below: <URL>... B) Keep in mind that even in the second half of the Naruto series, Naruto still desires has dating related interest in Sakura dates as shown here: <URL>... Naruto says (and I quote): ""Jeez and I was just devising a plan for the two of us to go on a walk, almost like a date"" Granted, there is more evidence than the above, but the fact that he flat out confirms he has romantic feelings for Sakura and that he is interested in dating her is rather sufficient if I do say so myself. #3. NARUTO PAIRING WITH HINATA AND SAKURA PAIRING WITH SASUKE IS FAR TOO UNLIKELY. Now my opponent may attempt to provide reasons as to why Naruto and Hinata could become involved with one another, however, if we look at the most recent manga chapter, we shall note that Hinata is killed by the leader of the akatuski (Pein). <URL>... <URL>... With Hinata dead, there is absolutely now chance of NaruHina occurring. As for SasuSaku (Sasuke and Sakura), let us observe the following piece of evidence: <URL>... Here, we see Sakura preparing to attack Sasuke (something which she was unwilling to do in the past) and we see Sasuke prepared to kill Sakura (as noted by Yamato). Surely if there were something between the two, at least one of them would not have resorted to such drastic measures. Now this doesn't completely negate the possibility of SasuSaku, but it sure makes it unlikely. CONCLUSION: 1) We have plenty of reason to believe that Naruto has romantic feelings for Sakura 2) We have plenty of reason to believe that Sakura has romantic feelings for Naruto. 3) We have reason to believe that it is unlikely that the other possible pairings (NaruHina and SasuSaku) will occur. 4) Therefore, it is most likely that Naruto will be romantically involved with Sakura at some point in the future. Some of the above points may need clarification depending on my opponent's objections. At any rate, the above shall do it for now. Engage.",1,Logical-Master,"

1) We have plenty of reason to believe that Naruto has romantic feelings for Sakura  
2) We have plenty of reason to believe that Sakura has romantic feelings for Naruto.  
3) We have reason to believe that it is unlikely that the other possible pairings (NaruHina and SasuSaku) will occur.  
4) Therefore, it is most likely that Naruto will be romantically involved with Sakura at some point in the future.  
  
Some of the above points may need clarification depending on my opponent's objections. At any rate, the above shall do it for now.
