He's been repeatedly accused in these debates of using this resolution to boost his stats, and those who agree with that sentiment will vote for me simply because they believe he shouldn't be able to continue to do so. He may argue that I've done something unscrupulous by giving him so little time to reply, asking voters to vote against me because of this, but I've only made the ""game"", as he calls it, more challenging. If he wasn't up for the challenge, he shouldn't have accepted. It shows the time you have for each debate before you accept. I further argue he will lose because he forfeited his last round.

2,"This might seem unfair at first, but this round is technical talk. I'm not really talking resolution and frame rate; I'm talking more of the fact that Majora's Mask is just reused assets from Ocarina of Time reassembled and sold at market price, while Skyrim is a groundbreaking, massive open world game that also lets the player modify the game to their own liking. The combat is more fleshed out even considering the innovation Z-targeting was, and the player is granted almost complete freedom within this open world. You might say that it's a limit of technology; I say that Elder Scrolls 2 Daggerfall came out two years prior and still hosts one of the largest maps in gaming, second only to Minecraft. I won't say that Ocarina of Time is a bad game. It isn't. Dark Souls could be considered the next in line with a matching style, and I love that game with a vengeance. But it is a relic of the past, and following Zelda games are just graverobbing at this point. See you next time, Duncan.",1,Duncan,"

3,"You've made the word count small, so I'll only be covering adventure as a theme. I would like to begin with the central theme of the original Legend of Zelda. Most people would agree the original theme of the game was adventure, allowing exploration and challenge in equal measures. This was one of the key factors that shaped games such as Pokemon too, getting to explore a new world with new sights. But it died fast. The Zelda formula was devised. With the formula made, all games became practically the same. Mechanically superb, but stagnant. The plot was gone, the adventure was gone. Skyrim and Oblivion gave the player a world to explore at their own pace and leisure. Few dungeons require progress in the main quest to enter. On the other hand, to get to a dungeon in Ocarina required you to find permission to enter the dungeon. This barrier is for narrative purpose, but you can find the Elder Scroll in Skyrim before asked to get it. Next round, Link the character with some rebuttal.",1,Duncan,"

4,"Now, I'd like to address the character of Link. You see, while Link has been more of a character in games such as Wind Waker, but the fact that every Link is a reincarnation means that each one is not the same person. While Skyrim doesn't have a main character as they are custom made, you can at least choose the appearance of the Dragonborn. Link is stuck in his tunic and hat, colour is the only changing factor, and there is no character to get to know. I don't recall sneaking into Terminam in Majora's Mask. Aren't you chasing Skull Kid? And while I did like the moon's constant reminder of the consequences should you fail, Skyrim still has the Throat of the World towering above the player reminding them of their goal. Loading screens are in Scrolls games, but they also feature massive maps with dungeons dotting the landscape. LoZ also had the Song of Time and the Song of Soaring as loading screens. This might be a bit unfair, but I'm talking technical next round. Duncan.",1,Duncan,"

He may claim this was unfair, but he garnered 6 wins himself using a variation of the same tactic. The time allotted to write your arguments is disclosed before you accept, and by the definition of the word itself, this is a rule he must adhere to. If he contests this rule, or attempts to argue it's unfair, then according to rule 1, having broken rule 5, he'd automatically lose. I only said I'd copy your resolution, not every rule of the debate. And regardless, you had all information disclosed before you accepted; if you were opposed to the rules, you should have been more careful. This seems only fair since you would have had more time to prepare yourself for your own resolution. Happy Debating. :)",1,BananaPhilosopher,"
