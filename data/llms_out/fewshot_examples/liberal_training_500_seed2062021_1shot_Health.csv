10,"I gladly accept this challenge. Framework: In order to clarify the round, I will provide a few definitions. According to the New American Oxford Dictionary , fund is explained as to "" provide with money for a particular purpose "". Therefore, as defined as such, any arguments stemming from the methods that may or may not influence the American population are considered null and void and should not be considered in today's round. Furthermore, we define illegal as "" contrary to or forbidden by law, especially criminal law "". Therefore, we must not include substances including tobacco and alcohol in today's round as well. Secondarily, the general intent of a drug rehabilitation is to enable the patient to cease substance abuse, in order to avoid the psychological, legal, financial, social, and physical consequences that can be caused, especially by extreme abuse. Therefore, if the PRO can prove that the intent of the program has been fulfilled, then the PRO must win today's round. Contention 1: The intent of the program is justifiable as addiction and consumption has risen the past few years. An estimated 20.4 million people in the United States used some kind of illicit drug in the past 30 days, according to the latest government statistics. About 8.3 percent of all persons age 12 and over are involved in use of illegal drugs or the non-medical use of prescription drugs. T here are the most commonly abused drugs: Marijuana, by 14.8 million people, or 6 percent. Cocaine, 2.4 million users. Hallucinogens, including Ecstasy, 1 million users. Methamphetamine, about 731,000 users. Prescription drugs, 7 million non-medical users. The simple fact of the matter is that the problem of illicit drug addiction has gone up in recent years to a point where millions of Americans are under the influence daily. This is simply not something the United States government can ignore. Contention 2: Each user of an illicit drug is not always at fault. When we look at the causes for illicit drug usage, we see that it is not always the person's choice to do such. A recent study by the Drugs-Violence Task Force of the National Sentencing Commission explains, reasons range from ""to have a good time with my friends""--a social reason, as well as ""to get high."" However, those in the heavier user groups increasingly mention psychological coping as the underlying reasons for their use--""to get through the day,"" ""to relieve boredom,"" ""to deal with anger and frustration,"". With this, we see that these users of the illicit drugs are influenced by their peers, by psychological reasons, and by the accompanying stress that may appear in their lives. The following factors may even increase your likelihood of having a drug addiction: Family members who have struggled with addiction An abusive or neglectful childhood Mental health issues, including depression The use of drugs at a relatively young age All kinds of people can struggle with addiction regardless of whether or not these risk factors are prevalent in their lives. These illicit drugs act as an outlet for them, however our rehabilitation programs will prove to them that it is not an outlet. Contention 3: Rehabilitation programs ultimately work. Many people like to promote the myth that addictions can be overcome with willpower. Sadly, this is not true. When people use drugs, particularly over stretches of time, their brain changes in response to prolonged exposure to those drugs. Their cravings tend to get stronger, and they may feel compelled to use more of the drugs. This biological reality makes quitting alone very difficult. Thanks to drug addiction programs , there is no reason to go through the recovery process in a vacuum. These programs provide addicts with the support that they need to rehabilitate. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 23.5 million persons aged 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol abuse problem in 2009 (9.3 percent of persons aged 12 or older). Of these, only 2.6 million--11.2 percent of those who needed treatment--received it at a specialty facility. Most all of these patients were able to leave the facility cured. Contention 4: Rehabilitation programs are cost-effective. A new study of 1992 data estimates the economic costs to society of substance abuse at $246 billion for that year, and $276 billion projected for 1995. Alcohol-related lost productivity alone accounted for two-thirds of the total alcohol cost. Drug related crime accounted for over half of the total drug costs. Workplaces take the brunt in lost/poor performance, accidents, and crime. We are losing money from those who use illicit drugs. Decreasing the problem will aid in improving the economy and gaining more funds to actually counter the problem. Additionally, as I explain my framework, the government will not only rely on taxes to fund these programs but may reallocate in order to pay for this increasing problem. We need to do something before it is too late. Therefore, you need to vote for PRO in today's round. --- Thank you, ~ThyAnchor",1,Thyanchor,"

13,"I'm not aware of any kind of ""artificial"" wellbeing as you have suggested, only simply, wellbeing. There are many paths up the mountain. Is it really that uncommon for your primary physician to ask, ""How have you been feeling?"" Or a therapist? Example: I have a broken leg. It's a basic fracture that doesn't require surgury or even need to be reset. A simple protective cast is ordered and I am prescribed and given pain medication, the opiate narcotic pain killer Vicodin. Now with the proper recommended dose the opiate in my blood stream goes straight to work blocking the pain receptors of my nervous system, thus preventing the pain chemicals in my body from being received; the ""feeling"" of the searing pain from a broken bone is NOT ""felt"" ... But another curious thing happens, by blocking pain receptors I also receive, as a side effect, feelings and waves of comfort: I am high.. Stoned.. Drugged up.. and it ""feels"" great! Most would say, ""Well, damn, he just broke his leg, of course, let him take the pain killers until the pain subsides.."" or ""Who cares if he is high or feels good, he has a broken leg.."" or ""I'm sure breaking a leg is stressful, hopefully the pain meds give him some relief and comfort.."" Now lets notice and explore a couple of ideas here in the example I have given: 1) The narcotic does nothing to actually repair the broken bone in my leg! The narcotic only merely ""tricks"" my body that I'm not in pain. 2) Because the drug makes me high, I feel good (despite my broken leg) yet the source (the opiate) is technically synthetic and artificial; least we say superficial as well.. YET, I STILL FEEL GOOD (which is the point). So now let's distinguish this and contrast this from your views. Sure, the Vicodin is acting directly with the chemistry of my body.

I'm not aware of any kind of ""artificial"" wellbeing as you have suggested, only simply, wellbeing.  
  
There are many paths up the mountain.  
  
Is it really that uncommon for your primary physician to ask, ""How have you been feeling?"" Or a therapist?  
  
Example: I have a broken leg. It's a basic fracture that doesn't require surgury or even need to be reset. A simple protective cast is ordered and I am prescribed and given pain medication, the opiate narcotic pain killer Vicodin.  
  
Now with the proper recommended dose the opiate in my blood stream goes straight to work blocking the pain receptors of my nervous system, thus preventing the pain chemicals in my body from being received; the ""feeling"" of the searing pain from a broken bone is NOT ""felt"" ... But another curious thing happens, by blocking pain receptors I also receive, as a side effect, feelings and waves of comfort: I am high.. Stoned.. Drugged up.. and it ""feels"" great!  
  
Most would say, ""Well, damn, he just broke his leg, of course, let him take the pain killers until the pain subsides.."" or ""Who cares if he is high or feels good, he has a broken leg.."" or ""I'm sure breaking a leg is stressful, hopefully the pain meds give him some relief and comfort..""  
  
Now lets notice and explore a couple of ideas here in the example I have given:  
1) The narcotic does nothing to actually repair the broken bone in my leg! The narcotic only merely ""tricks"" my body that I'm not in pain.  
2) Because the drug makes me high, I feel good (despite my broken leg) yet the source (the opiate) is technically synthetic and artificial; least we say superficial as well.. YET, I STILL FEEL GOOD (which is the point).
