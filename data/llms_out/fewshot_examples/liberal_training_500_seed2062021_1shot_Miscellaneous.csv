Utilizing the 30 minutes of prep time within the fighting area, Kleptin could scout the the battlefield and look for some trees which could secure him a comfortable position to sit in, while not being too high above ground. Upon finding such a tree, Kleptin could begin the battle by waiting for the blood lusted adult grizzly bear to come and attack him.

Kleptin could his knowledge and understanding of biology to his advantage and find natural ingredients on the battlefield or simply tip his high quality hunting knife in snake/spider/salamander venom (in other words, similar to way this weapon has been used historically: <URL>... ) and strengthen the effect of his weapon. At this point, upon coming in contact with the bear, a few simple swipe to the bear's vital areas would be sufficient enough to make the result of the battle in Kleptin's favor. Granted, this direct approach would probably result in Kleptin getting injured. Fortunately, it is established that Kleptin has extraordinary reasoning abilities (he even admits this in the comment section), thus would be more than capable of logically concluding a method which enabled him to get in a few effective swipes on the opposing bear without any serious injury. The most likely approach would be for Kleptin to design a trap of some sort which would allow him to bypass the bear's detection (so far, I shall insist that making use of his tree climbing skills and waiting for the bear to come by would be the best approach) or convince the bear into believing that he is already dead (which is a more common and effective method of eluding a bear, provided the bear is not merely searching for fear and responding defensively: <URL>... ).

6,"I'd like to start off the round by thanking my opponent for his response and for suggesting we go onto this forum to debate this subject after our first encounter on YouTube. I always relish the opportunity to challenge the beliefs and positions held by myself and others. A problem emerges: ""I would like to take this opportunity to remind the reader that this isn't a debate on whether abortion should be legal but rather if all people who think it should be illegal are ignorant and/or inhuman. As such Pro's generic arguments for legalized abortion are off-point."" While I partially agree with Con's reminder to the reader that this isn't a debate on whether abortion should be legal per say, I feel that I must correct my opponent's misconception on the actual subject of this debate. This debate is not about the people who hold a pro-life position but about the position itself being either an inhuman or ignorant position to hold. I do think that a person who holds a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) is ignorant in the sense that they are either ill informed or misguided however I do not think they are inhuman as in suffering from some for of psychopathy. In fact I think they may have an over abundance of humanity however misplaced it may be. After reading Con's response it took me a few moments to see why Con's responses were not making much sense as a rebuttal to me because I happen to agree with quite a few of premises he puts forward in his response including his claim that "" The lack of absolute logical consistancy (spelled: consistency) doesn't equate to ignorance. Futhermore, (spelled: Furthermore) emotional attachment doesn't equate to inherent value or worthiness of legal protection. "" I believe I found the issue in rereading my opening arguments and can also see how someone could have taken my position to mean what Con has stated it to be and I'll attempt to address that issue. Addressing the issue: In my opening arguments I stated: ""My basic contention is that a person holding a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) is either inhuman - given the logical, philosophical, and real life consequences of holding and/or implementing said position - OR they are simply ignorant of the consequences of holding and/or implementing their position."" I think this is where the issue/misunderstanding came from and it is somewhat understandable. The language I used can be taken as Con has suggested based on the in limited scope of his response about human irrationality due to our emotional nature and the nature of emotion to override our cognitive faculties. However that maxim does not excuse holding an irrational position but rather it requires that we take emotion and prejudice into account when developing rules and laws which will apply to all people - however rational or irrational they may be - so that the rules and laws are not based on emotions or prejudice. Given the facts and arguments that I presented in my case, (which Con has dismissed off hand as virtually irrelevant given the limited scope in which he has interpreted my position) holding a pro-life position (as defined in the preface) did seem to suggest a desire to cause demonstrable harm to a society (i.e. inhuman intent) unless that individual were simply ignorant of the consequences (logical, philosophical, and real life) of his or her position. There is however a third distinct possibility brought to light by Con's response: The possibility that a pro-life advocate is emotionally attached to the notion of the unborn having rights the same as anyone reading these statements and is therefore holding their position for irrational reasons. Con's case: Con seems to suggest that pro-life advocates are simply mere human and not ""...cold, logical machines that would save the maximum amount of lives regardless of emotions or societal conditioning."" I agree with him, however taken in the context of the subject, this seems to me to be an ""emotional, irrational and prejudice"" response to the ""cold logical"" case for pro-choice I presented in my opening argument. I'm not sure how emotionally cold it is to hold a position that supports a system of laws that promotes the maximum well-being of a society and therefore the highest level of humanity possible. Aside: ""Pro's generic arguments for legalized abortion are off-point. So are Pro's railing against my non-existent theological arguments and defense of abstinence-only education. This is made especially ironic by the fact I've clearly labeled myself an atheist on my profile. I would ask Pro to please stay on point."" At the time of writing my opening arguments I did not know Con's religious status seeing as how we only encountered each other a short time ago on YouTube and (to my knowledge) he had not entered his religious status on his profile at the time of my posting. My intent was not to assume my opponent's religious status which is why I used the language I did in saying, "" Sho uld someone site religious grounds against abortion..."" The fact that Con would not and will not make religiously motivated arguments on this issue is virtually irrelevant to this debate. Many (dare I say, most) pro-life advocates depend on and/or derive their pro-life stance from religious reasoning. I would be remiss were I not to point out the major religious aspect of the pro-life movement because it only adds to the ignorance and/or the newly added irrational category of a major portion of people who hold a pro-life position. I imagine my opponent (being an atheist) would actually agree with that statement. Conclusion: I believe Con has simply misunderstood my position given the limited scope of his arguments and counterpoints. I eagerly await his reply.",1,themanofearth,"

  ""Pro's generic arguments for legalized abortion are off-point.     So are Pro's railing against my non-existent theological arguments and defense of abstinence-only education. This is made especially ironic by the fact I've clearly labeled myself an atheist on my profile. I would ask Pro to please stay on point.”  
  
At the time of writing my opening arguments I did not know Con's religious status seeing as how we only encountered each other a short time ago on YouTube and (to my knowledge) he had not entered his religious status on his profile at the time of my posting. My intent was not to assume my opponent's religious status which is why I used the language I did in saying, “  Sho  uld   someone site religious grounds against abortion...”   
  
The fact that Con would not and will not make religiously motivated arguments on this issue is virtually irrelevant to this debate. Many (dare I say, most) pro-life advocates depend on and/or derive their pro-life stance from religious reasoning. I would be remiss were I not to point out the major religious aspect of the pro-life movement because it only adds to the ignorance and/or the newly added irrational category of a major portion of people who hold a pro-life position. I imagine my opponent (being an atheist) would actually agree with that statement.  
  
  Conclusion:  
  I believe Con has simply misunderstood my position given the limited scope of his arguments and counterpoints. I eagerly await his reply.",Miscellaneous,1,Pro-life-Ignorance-or-Inhuman/1/,29241

Not every social network is made for a common interest, a la Facebook/Twitter. I'll address each of these individually, then detail why my argument still stands. No ""typical"" social network is made only for debating. I assume by ""typical"", the opponent is referring to the average. In the case of social networks, it doesn't even make sense to think in terms of ""average"". Consider the following list: Cats: Felix - Brown Bob - Orange Margaret - Calico Tom - Gray Rufus - Black Now, what is the ""average"" color? Of course, you cannot determine an average or ""typical"" color because ""color"" is not a numerical value and cannot be mathematically operated on. Similarly, the ""type"" of social network follows the same logic. Some are purely for interpersonal communication, some are for ""debate"", some are for ""cars"" and some are for ""humor"". It does not make sense to describe the ""average type of social network"" because the very nature of ""type"" does not allow for mathematical averaging. Given this, it is clear that the opponent's point is meaningless. Of course DDO is not a ""typical social network"" -- no social network is ""typical"". Even if we found conversion that allowed us to convert ""type"" into a numerical value, we would still expect DDO to be ""atypical"", since in any distribution with a sufficient number of discrete values, the majority of values are not average . No typical social network has elections for President. Again, this is a meaningless point by the logic mentioned above. If anything, this simply highlights the social nature of what we do here, thus reinforcing my claim that DDO is exactly a social network. Not every social network is made for a common interest. This is false. The error here is assuming that the ""common interest"" must be extremely specific, as is the case in DDO, where the interest is ""debate"". On more popular social networks like Facebook and Twitter, the common interest is simply ""the desire to share your opinions, memories and thoughts"", which is precisely the function of these social networks. Clearly if a social network was released that did not appeal to a common interest, it would not be used by any more than one person, meaning there would be no ""social activities"" taking place, meaning it could not be defined as a social network. Conclusion I've demonstrated that the opponent's counter-points are either meaningless or irrelevant. In the first round, I clearly proved that by definition DDO is a social network.

Using the example of the rock too heavy for God to life, the contradiction that arises which my opponent takes to be oxymoronic is NOT something wrong with the terminology, but rather is contained in the logicality of what the two notions ARE. For example, given that ""All rocks are green"" is true, it cannot be the case that there exists a brown rock, because we have already assumed ""all rocks are green"" is true, and to entertain the notion of a brown rock negates what we have already taken to be true. Likewise, if we are given that ""God is omnipotent"" and assume it is true, then it cannot be the case that there exists a rock too heavy for him to lift. It's very simple really. 2) Omnipotent cannot be oxymoronic without a contrast. The fact of the matter is that without a contrast like ""deafening silence"" or ""mournful optimist,"" the term omnipotent cannot be an oxymoron because it does not contain two opposite statements. To be an oxymoron, my opponent must show an implicit opposition in ""all powerful"" or ""universal authority."" ************************************************************************* Throughout the debate, my opponent has relied on the reader misunderstanding my argument instead of making one of his own.
