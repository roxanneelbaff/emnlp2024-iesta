Arguing Skills > Homework Help My opponent stated that she knows plenty of schools who use debate.org for homework help, I assume because she's attended plenty of schools. But whether many people use this for homework help or not, that's not the point of this site. The point of this site is to give users better arguing and debating skills, and then exhibit them against others.

4,"1. It's About Arguing, Not Homework Help. My opponent believes it is the purpose of the users of debate.org to provide people who are too lazy to go to a database with information on their research projects. But that's not what debate.org is for. Debate.org was created so that people could exercise their arguing skills. Since this can be done in both a humorous and political sense equally, there's no reason to ban humorous debates. Furthermore, allowing debaters to go outside of their political comfort zone is even more beneficial to the debater by giving them a wider spectrum of issues to discuss. 2. It's Good For Business I'd like to refer to a debate of my own, If I may. [ <URL>... ] This debate, within a week, surpassed the record for most views tenfold with 1.2 million views. It brought outside viewers in from the brony fandom to consider joining this site, and was more than beneficial to helping grow the debate.org community. 3. They're Not Going Anywhere Humorous/Entertainment debates will never be completely gone from debate.org. Due to events like a humor debater by the name of imabench entering the debate.org hall of fame, ""Applejack is Best Pony"" becoming a viral sensation, and even humorists who pretend to be serious like ""Anti-Atheist"" or ""Qopel"" hitting spotlights here and there, humor is nearly as important of a quality to the debate community as political and religious arguments. Again I say. Let there be trolls, ladies and gentlemen. Let, there, be, trolls. REMINDER: I AM CON, SHE IS PRO. Vote MassiveDump.",1,MassiveDump,"
