3,"My opponent has not responded to my refutation of his 'Now Factor' argument, his 'Truth Factor' argument, or my own Argument from inability and so I will extend those arguments. My opponent has however provided his source as to his 'Omnipotent Factor' argument and so I will spend this round attempting to refute it solely. The omnipotent factor The argument may be summed up as follows. Assuming that if his nose grows, he lied and if he lies, his nose grows, Pinnochio must necessarily be omnipotent since he may make any claim truthful since the universe ""does whatever it can to avoid paradoxes"". Basically, Pinnochio may claim for example that either his nose will grow or he will become a real boy. Assuming the statement is false(and that neither his nose will grow, nor will he be magically transformed), we are lead into a paradox because if he does not become a real boy his nose will grow, making it a truthful statement, then un-truthful, and so on and so on ad infinitum.The only way for this not to be a paradox is if we grant that he would become a real boy, thus effectively making Pinnochio omnipotent and giving him the power to make his nose grow at will. However, this argument runs into some problems quick. For example, consider this example. A man X is about to cross a bridge guarded by Man Y. Many approaches Man X before he attempts to cross, telling him that if he correctly answers the next question, he may pass. Man X responds by saying, ""You will not allow me to cross"". We are at a clear paradox here that may logically occur with no meddling by any natural laws against it. Must Man X be omnipotent then to resolve the paradox? If we say no than there is no more reason to say yes in Pinnochio's case.",1,socialpinko,"

4,"Ave. Sadly, Pro has broken the rules of the debate that I stipulated in the first round. I stated that the first round of the debate was for acceptance, and arguments would take place in round two. Every argument Pro gave in the last round is impermissible. I ask Pro to give her arguments during the appropriate round. I would like to state, in clear terms, what I will be arguing for in this debate. I believe that cosmology demonstrates that there was no initial state of the universe, or a singularity. God is defined as the cause of the initial state. If there was in fact no initial state or singularity, then god cannot exist, because an attribute of god cannot be actualized. This will be called the 'No Initial State' argument, and the premises go like this. 1: Cosmology demonstrates that there is no cosmological singularity. 2: An attribute of god is that god caused the cosmological singularity. 3: From one and two, god has an attribute that is impossible. 4: God does not exist. [Support for P1] The theory of relativity is one of the most proven theories in all of science. There are many proofs of general relativity, some complex and some simple, so I will show that relativity is true using one of the simpler arguments. For many centuries, it was noted that the orbit of Mercury was slightly different from what Newton's equations would predict. Instead of orbiting in a perfect ellipse like other plants, the orbit of Mercury precesses (which means it does not return to the same point after one orbit, but shifts slightly). When Einstein calculated the orbit of Mercury using the equations of general relativity, it predicted the orbit of Mercury with perfect accuracy. This is a strong indication that the theory of relativity is true. So, what implications does the theory of relativity have on the first premise? Well, there are equations derived from the theory of relativity called the 'Freedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker' metric. This metric describes a universe that is homogeneous, isotrophic, and expanding universe. The models of the universe that are based on this metric have no initial state. [2] There is not some state X that god can cause. Because general relativity is true, FLRW metrics are true, and therefore there is no initial state. The Hawking-Penrose singularity theorem posits a singularity that the universe came from. However, Hawking and Penrose have withdrawn this theorem a long time ago. Why? They realized that, once you take quantum mechanics into account, there is no need for a singularity. Hawking has this to say in his book A Brief History of Time. [2] "" It is perhaps ironic that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other physicists that there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of the universe--as we shall see later, it can disappear once quantum effects are taken into account ."" [3] Quetin Smith, professor of the philosophy of physics at Western Michigan university, talks about the impossibility of a singularity. "" The cosmic singularity is a hypothetical time t=0 at which all the laws of nature, space and time break down. It is hypothetical or merely imaginary because if it did exist, it would be a physically impossible state, due to the breakdown of all laws, even the laws required for time to exist. This breakdown at the hypothetical t=0 implies there is no first instant t=0 of the finitely old time-series and that each instant is preceded by earlier instants. "" [4] Cosmology supports the idea that there was no initial state or a singularity. [Support for P2] The truth of P2 is contained in the definition of god that Pro agreed to in round one. [Support for P3] This follows logically from P1 and P2. [Conclusion] If there is no initial state, then god cannot cause an initial state. An attribute of god is causing the initial state. Since it is impossible for god to cause an initial state, an attribute of god cannot be actualized. Therefore, god does not exist.

Economically Although some capitalism elements are present in other economic systems through history, it only truly developed itself in with the industrial era. With industries, millions of people could stop working for their Lords in Europe(specially in Britain) to work on factories. In the beginning there was some exploitations, but with the increasing amount of enterprises and the market being more and more competitive, wages started going up and working hours down! In Britain, estimates that salaries rose 15% to 150% between 1780 and 1850. And all without unions or labor rights.(1) In Brazil, where I live, when industrial capitalism truly came during the 70's, our life improvement never rose so much. In countries where the economy was basically rural, the industries provided jobs with bigger salaries than in the agriculture and were able to produce goods in mass, thus making prices fall and giving the possibility to more people to acquire it.(2) Socially Capitalism improved people standards of living.(3) When agriculture became mechanized, more food was produced, thus their prices fell and made it affordable for poor people and hence improved their health, as they could eat more. The rise of wages (which I explained in my previous argument) enabled people to pay for better health care, afford medicine, school, books and goods that make our lives comfortable, such as televisions or Iphones. It gives the opportunity for people who were born nobodies to become famous liders or entrepeneurs, such as Margaret Thatcher, Barack Obama or S.B. Fuller. Politically Capitalism gives political liberty. With better wages provided by free-market, more people can afford reading books and studying on free time, giving them some political knowledge and the possibility to form their political opinion. The better wages also gives people political power against a tyrannical State which would take their money away and give them to other people. Yes, there will always be poor people, but capitalism gave them higher standards of living. More people with more money stop the state from getting too big. Only a big state creates and perpetuate the poverty and take away people's freedom. Capitalism provides people the possibility of choice. They can choose to like the government, to vote, not to vote, candidate themselves and even criticising capitalism! No other system can provide this. Morally People are free, not equal. As I stated before, capitalism provides freedom, which is natural to every human being. But equality no. We are naturally unequal.

Given that this debate is only 3 rounds and that my opponent has posted his opening arguments in round one (at least I think that's what that is o.O), I will go ahead of post my arguments. Arguments 1. Eggs =/= Fruit Fruit is defined as, "" a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower , mainly one or more ovaries ."" [1] Given that eggs have nothing to do with plants, Pro's resolution that eggs are fruits has already been defeated. 2. Eggs =/= Chicken Fruit Pro also calls eggs ""chicken fruit"". Whether this is meant to be part of his resolution or not, I'm not sure, but either way it is incorrect. To refute this claim, all one must do is compare the qualities of eggs with fruits and see if they match up. First thing, Pro refers to the yolk of an egg as the seed. This is incorrect. Yolks don't grow into anything, they simply feed the chicken embryo. If anything, the chicken embryo would be the seed as it grows into a chicken just as a seed grows into a tree. Even still, this is an unequal comparison. For starters, seeds don't out-grow the fruit as a chicken embryo does to an egg. In fact, in some cases the fruit's purpose is the exact opposite to that of the egg shell. The egg is meant to protect the chicken embryo from outside forces until such time that the chicken has grown enough to break out of the egg and start its life. The fruit, in the case of apples, cherries, blackberries, etc. is meant to incise animals so that they eat the fruit and therefore the seed along with it. This way, the seed passes through the animal's digestive system where it is eventually dispersed along with some much needed fertilizer. [2] In other words, the egg is meant to protect the chicken embryo from potential predators while the fruit is meant to get the seed eaten. 3. Dreams are Irrelevant Pro talks about a dream he had in which he planted an egg yolk and a tree grew. This is literally nonsense. Dreams are not bound by natural laws and therefore cannot be used as evidence of anything. Conclusion Factually speaking, eggs are not fruits. This is incontestable. However, even on a structural level fruits are not comparable to eggs a they differ so greatly in both process and purpose, sometimes to the point of having virtually opposite functions as I have shown.

15,"I thank my opponent for an interesting opening round and hope to provide just as interesting arguments. But before I do so, I will attempt to refute his three arguments. The now factor Anatomy of the grammar behind the statement My opponent's first argument is basically that the very semantic structure of Pinnochio's statement would imply a lie. From the same source that Pro obtained his definition of 'now', one can find another alternate definition which fits more eloquenty into the sentence and which I believe more effectively demonstrates the purpose of the statement. The definition reads: In these present times; nowadays When Pinochio says the statement, ""My nose will now grow."", he is not describing an already existing fact. If he were, the grammatically correct statement would be ""My nose is(in the process of growing). There is an obvious difference between these two statements, one describing an action that is about to happen(such as when a magician claims that he will now saw a woman in half) and the other describing an action that is currently happening. Basic grammar and common sense dictates that Pinnochio when making the statement had the former meaning in mind. The truth factor The possibility of multipe growth qualifiers In this argument, my opponent brings up the possibility that Pinnochio's nose also grows when he is telling the truth. However, this possibility is actually demonstratably false. If we start from the premise that there are basically three types of statements as relating to this debate, then there is proof that Pinnochio's nose does not grow when he is telling the truth. The three statement types are truthhood, falsity, and a statement where the speaker is unsure about the truth/non-truth value or is not making a declarative statement. So, in order to diprove this argument, we need only find a declarative statement made by Pinnochio in which his nose does not grow. Refer to the 50 second mark of my video[1] in which Pinnochio answers Jiminy's question regarding whether he wanted to be a real boy. Pinnochio answers affirmatively that he does in fact wish to be a real boy. This obviously being a declarative statement, we can see that Pinnochio's nose in no way grows after he makes the statement, leading any rational observer to conclude that his nose at the very least does not grow when he is making a truthful statement. The omnipotent factor The source my opponent provided not working. Seeing as he provides no other substantial evidence for Pinnochio's alleged omnipotence other than the link, it is safe on my part to dismiss the argument as it holds no evidential or logical weight. At the most, the argument could only rise to the height of speculation since in order to prove his theory, my opponent would need to show with evidence why Pinnochio did not incorporate his omnipotence either to make himself a real boy in the first place, or how a puppet made out of cherry wood would come to possess such powers in the first place. Now on to my own positive arguments in favor of my case. Assumed falsity of Pinnochio's statement or the Argument from inability As anyone who has ever read 'The Adventures of Pinnochio' or seen the more popular Disney adaptation of the character to film, Pinnochio's personality is just like that of a small boy. Pinnochio is not very intelligent and his mind seems to function just as a prepubescent real boy would. As such, Pinnochio obviously does not or would not understand the logical and philosophical outcomes of such a statement. Why is this fact relevant? From the very fact that a lie(of which I have established is the only method of making his nose grow that can be evidentially backed up either from my opponent's framing of the character in R1 or from a plethora of video evidence. A lie is defined by Dictionary.com as: A false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive Seeing as Pinnochio has trouble tying his shoes, it does not seem like a stretch of the imagination that he would be unable to lie about the statement, just as it would be impossible for someone who had never heard of Lysander Spooner could not be held to be lying for saying that he did not have a beard. Pinnochio has no knowledge(that is ever shown) of even rudimentary skills in logic or philosophy. Seeing as lying is the purposeful intent to deceive and Pinnochio does not have the knowledge necessary to carry that out, his statement could not have been a lie. The resolution has been negated as I have shown that Pinnochio's nose would more than likely not grow in the event that he said ""My nose will now grow"".

This is especially vital when we consider that the investigation of truth requires psychological commitment.

Listeners will get confused, bored, believe the scientist is arrogant, and possibly feel threatened. The journalist can also embarrass the scientist by cherry-picking details and making artistic retorts. There's also the matter of people being able to claim that truth is relative. Instead of analyzing how it's necessary for things to exist, people can simply synthesize what's possible for things to exist. In turn, they make appeals to emotion, popularity, misery, authority, and misery in order to justify their positions.

Yes that is true, because American and European workers earned more money than in the nineteenth century and could afford better education for their children who did not want to work in a factory. If more people have a college degree why the hell they would want to work in a factory.

I would also like the sources for her statement: "" Even in World War Two[...], only 15-20% of soldiers actually fired at the enemy"". She also talks about prejudices. This is interesting.

My mother is black and my dad is white. Where did she took this from. And I should remind her that prejudices are bad for capitalists.

  As far as we know, knowledge involves consciousness, and death, more specifically brain death, entails that the '  mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist'. (3) In other words, when you die, your mind no longer exists to do any experiencing, believing, reasoning, or to have any awareness, and thus has no capability of obtaining knowledge in any sense I'm familiar with. It seems as though being alive with a functioning brain seems to be a necessary condition for having knowledge, which means that having knowledge after one is dead seems rather nonsensical.  In order to demonstrate that any human could 'know reality after they died', as you claim, you would have to demonstrate that any function of the mind could exist after death. The burden of proof falls upon you to demonstrate that a mind could do anything at all after death, before you can even begin to argue that knowledge is somehow   only   attainable post mortem.

20,"Ave. [No Initial State Argument] Pro drops the entirety of this argument (once more). I have an argument on my side that shows god cannot exist that has gone unanswered. This tips the preponderance of evidence towards my side. [Bare Assertions] I asked Pro to give us some reasons to think that god created the Earth, and that everything came from a prior something. Pro ignores this and does not give us any reasons to think these things are true. Again, what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. [Contradiction] I showed that Pro was contradicting herself. She never responded to this argument. Another dropped point. [Dreams and Visions] Pro drops this argument. [Pro's Proof] There is nothing about Pro's proof that demonstrates anything requiring the supernatural. There were traitors, murderers, sexual deviants, and malicious, hateful, envious people during the times Revelation and Titus were written. Why do you need a supernatural being to make those observations? None of those verses even make a prediction about the future. They describe the present moment or the past.

21,"My argument here is that, for better or worse, rhetoric is more important than dialectic. This is in a few areas: 1) The art of persuasion, 2) Actual policy, and 3) The usefulness of language. First, rhetoric compresses nuanced meaning into words that accommodates the scarcity of attention span when discussing issues. That is by being artistic rather than logical, ordinary listeners can more easily pay attention and relate with what is being said. Lingo and jargon is ineffective and comes off as arrogant, but figurative language is down to earth and simpler to understand. Second, rhetoric shows inside information over how actual policy can be construed and enacted. A rhetorician demonstrates an understanding of how words can be interpreted in multiple ways as well as how word games can be played. Therefore, a rhetorician is an expert not only in composing ordinary language, but also in anticipating misinterpretation and doing what's needed to prevent it. Third, language is not merely an ideal set and syntax of words, but is an actual tool for directing others. A rhetorician understands this technique beyond simply being logical, but rather triggers an audience's switches in order to get desired results. This can even take place if the audience is not logically rigorous or methodical. Sometimes, people have pragmatic prejudices in their interpretations of words, so practice can happen by appealing to prejudice. Heck, sometimes, appealing to prejudice is necessary because it's central to an audience's motivation in general. Other times, it's necessary because there just isn't enough time to explain in detail. To be clear, I am not arguing here that rhetoric is more proper. What I'm arguing is properness isn't necessarily the value of language. Rhetoric addresses improperness in the aforementioned styles. Dialectic does not.",1,Daktoria,"

22,"My opponent is certainly a crafty one, but I will still prevail! Arguments 1. Proof of Ability My Pro claims that his dreams are real. That is, they have a prophetic quality to them. This claim must be proven. I suggest Pro take up the James Randi 1 million dollar paranormal challenge [1]. All he has to do is agree to a formal test in front of independent witnesses. To date, no one has won the prize money, but if Pro is so sure of his nocturnal clairvoyance then he will surely succeed... right? 2. Not Always Prophetic After proving his dream are, in fact, prophetic, Pro is then charged with the task of proving this dream in particular was prophetic. Meaning, he must plant an egg yolk and have a tree grow out of it. This must be done under the supervision of a 3rd party botanist to ensure validity, of course. To ensure that neither side is proven on a fluke, multiple yolks should be planted and multiple successes should be established. Until such time, Pro's BOP is unfulfilled. 3. Chicken > Egg >Chicken Pro contends that chickens lay eggs and eggs grow new chickens. This is true, but this is how eggs work, not how fruits work as I've shown previously. Argument negated. Defence of Arguments No counter-arguments were given. I extend my arguments from round 1.
