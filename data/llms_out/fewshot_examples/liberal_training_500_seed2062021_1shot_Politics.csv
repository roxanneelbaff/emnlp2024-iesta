6,"I'm glad you brought up the Voter ID laws actually. When it comes to the idea of changing the electoral college to the number of voters per state, having these laws can be a huge disadvantage. In history many Southern and more conservative states have always felt they needed to have larger representation, one of the reasons for this was because of the large populations in the Northern states. In the beginning of our nation, this has created the three-fifths act where every slave in the south counted for three-fifths of a person. The South knew they had to increase their political status somehow and although they looked at their slaves as barn animals they still tried to count them off as human ( <URL>... ). However in today's political and social atmosphere those opinions are long gone but not the idea of trying to suppress their votes. Were you aware that 31 DMV offices in Alabama will close down? The interesting part about it is that all of these counties are at least 75% black ( <URL>... ). In the article though it talks about how they only account for less then 5% of all Alabama DMV transactions, so in reality it doesn't give a large effect to the state's overall voting capacity. As of 2014 though, 26.7% of all of Alabama is Black ( <URL>... ). So if they try and suppress the voting rights of 26.7% of the voters in Alabama then they will lose 26.7% of their representation in their electoral college if they completely succeed. You see ,mathematically, changing the Electoral College to the number of voters can also punish the more conservative states for their subtle racist policies. For the sake of it though I would prefer to do some more detailed math. Based on a general poll in 2012, the study has shown that 25% of Black Americans do not have an ID. So if we take that into account of the 26.7% of Alabama, 20.025% of Alabama can still vote but also in the same study 8% of whites do not have an ID as well so 60.904% of Alabama can vote as well. Although the ratio of white to black voters go from 3 to 2 down 3 to 1, the percentage of the state's electoral college votes would actually go down by 12% thus hurting it's political representation. The way I figured the percentage was just adding total population percentage loss from both sides and have gotten a 6% cut from the total number of whites in Alabama but have also gotten the same total 6% cut from the total number of blacks in Alabama, thus giving a total of 12% ( <URL>... ). Now my point is this, we can be a lot more efficient and also referee the states that try and cheat through these laws just by counting the number of votes from each state. The math clearly shows just how we can do that and it has shown Alabama can easily lose an eighth of it's Electoral College votes. When it comes to representation though, a lot of these people are on the fringe of the mainstream American society. Do you believe that drug dealers,hookers,murderers and pedophiles deserve a vote? Why is it that when someone commits a felony the first thing we take away from them is the right to vote? It's because we believe their representation is null and void due to the fact they have caused such harm to society. We like to pretend that we would like to listen to everyone's opinion but would you listen to a pedophile's opinion about the sex offender laws being too harsh? And if we listen to their opinions wouldn't we be infringing on the rights of their victims to not live in fear? You see we already choose who gets to vote and who's opinion matters. I'd like to say I appreciate the debate and it truly was a fun one to discuss. I personally believe having these philosophical debates on politics and geography really is good for your mind.

Because people like me choose to be with people of their own gender? I believe that it is called love and it really doesn't matter the gender, it's hard for anyone to find. ""Child molesters..."" I'm not misjudging you. I'm reading exactly what you're writing and acting off of that. I violently disagree but that's not the point. You do watch porn, so you suffer from a perversion as well. So I assume you shouldn't get married either, right? But you're against porn? Wow. So not only do you believe I'm backwards and immoral but you're a plethora of contradiction...interesting. ""I know you..."" I'm sorry but I'm not interested in men. It is not a ""I can't find love"" thing it's a, ""I'm happy just the way I am"" thing. I'm in a deeply committed relationship and would not give that up, especially for a man. It's not something I'm interested in. That is also not the point of this debate... Summation of points: --> Traditionalism is no longer traditional. What my opponent fails to realize is that tradition has already been broken. Not all black couples ""jump the broom"", not all Jewish ones dance the Hora and smash bottles, and not all people throw rice. The times and practices have changed. What my opponent also fails to realize is that if we were still operating off of tradition, many interracial couples would not be permitted to marry either. --> My opponent is willing to discount an entire group of citizens a human right just because he disagrees with their sexual preference. This essentially is considering a group that makes up about ten percent of the world, subhuman. Due to the fact that you disagree with the way people live their lives they should have rights stripped? That is irrational and dehumanizing and is a reprehensible action. However, I am forced to not be blind to your beliefs. This denies a gay person their God - given rights, limits their liberty and impedes the quality of life which is all unfair. Again, all gay people had to come from somewhere, so if you're looking for someone to blame you should most likely try the straight folk, gays cannot reproduce on their own. --> Religion is still not an argument, no matter how much of the bible my opponent wants to use. The bible contradicts itself ever so frequently that though it may be a good basis for some things does not really prove itself useful in this argument. The bottom line is that presidents/vice presidents/senators and congressmen do not base their political policies off the bible. They base them off the Constitution and that is the document that should be adhered to. In addition, there is no universal religion. To solely operate off of Christianity would also circumvent other religions from playing a part in the legislative process and that too would be unfair. Conclusion: Most of my points have either gone unchallenged or partially challenged but reinforced. I hope the voters will recognize that some of my opponent's points didn't really have anything to do with the actual topic of this debate. There is no logical reason as to why homosexuals should be denied the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts. We are all humans and to be denied a human right is rather degrading. Marriage is not a heterosexual privilege but a human right and it is about time this gets recognized. ** I would like to honestly thank Hunton711 for this debate. Despite the fact that we obviously disagree I thank him for a nice exchange and forfeit - free debate. I believe in my mind that Hunton is a product of two or perhaps or perhaps an entire family of ultra - conservatives. I hope that you become more open - minded with age and experience and understand that there are certain things in life that cannot be helped. I did not choose this life, and I'm sure that there are many people who would actually WANT to live this way. I don't believe a lot of people realize that it is not that easy or great to be gay and often times is an internal identity struggle. However, I've learned a lot about people from debating this topic and thank Hunton for the challenge. I urge a vote for PRO and thank you for reading.",1,untitled_entity,"

I'm in a deeply committed relationship and would not give that up, especially for a man. It's not something I'm interested in. That is also not the point of this debate...  
  
Summation of points:  
  
--> Traditionalism is no longer traditional. What my opponent fails to realize is that tradition has already been broken. Not all black couples ""jump the broom"", not all Jewish ones dance the Hora and smash bottles, and not all people throw rice. The times and practices have changed. What my opponent also fails to realize is that if we were still operating off of tradition, many interracial couples would not be permitted to marry either.  
  
--> My opponent is willing to discount an entire group of citizens a human right just because he disagrees with their sexual preference. This essentially is considering a group that makes up about ten percent of the world, subhuman. Due to the fact that you disagree with the way people live their lives they should have rights stripped? That is irrational and dehumanizing and is a reprehensible action. However, I am forced to not be blind to your beliefs. This denies a gay person their God - given rights, limits their liberty and impedes the quality of life which is all unfair. Again, all gay people had to come from somewhere, so if you're looking for someone to blame you should most likely try the straight folk, gays cannot reproduce on their own.  
  
--> Religion is still not an argument, no matter how much of the bible my opponent wants to use. The bible contradicts itself ever so frequently that though it may be a good basis for some things does not really prove itself useful in this argument. The bottom line is that presidents/vice presidents/senators and congressmen do not base their political policies off the bible. They base them off the Constitution and that is the document that should be adhered to. In addition, there is no universal religion. To solely operate off of Christianity would also circumvent other religions from playing a part in the legislative process and that too would be unfair.  
  
Conclusion:  
Most of my points have either gone unchallenged or partially challenged but reinforced. I hope the voters will recognize that some of my opponent's points didn't really have anything to do with the actual topic of this debate. There is no logical reason as to why homosexuals should be denied the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts. We are all humans and to be denied a human right is rather degrading. Marriage is not a heterosexual privilege but a human right and it is about time this gets recognized.  
  
** I would like to honestly thank Hunton711 for this debate. Despite the fact that we obviously disagree I thank him for a nice exchange and forfeit - free debate. I believe in my mind that Hunton is a product of two or perhaps or perhaps an entire family of ultra - conservatives. I hope that you become more open - minded with age and experience and understand that there are certain things in life that cannot be helped. I did not choose this life, and I'm sure that there are many people who would actually WANT to live this way. I don't believe a lot of people realize that it is not that easy or great to be gay and often times is an internal identity struggle. However, I've learned a lot about people from debating this topic and thank Hunton for the challenge.

I defined what a border fence was, and established an argument that supplemented a border fence with a border wall. No harm, no foul. My definitions were given when my opponent did not specifically define anything. Thus, my definitions stand. 2) My opponent's next argument merely attempts to prove that another substance could be added to fences to make them stronger. However, rebar was not mentioned in the definition and holds no water. Besides, even if people can get through both rebar and a wall with power tools, that does not help either side of the debate. 3) My opponent provides random facts that really do not help either side. At the end of his point, however, he states that in comparison to money spent in reference to illegal immigration, it would be a small sum to pay for a border fence. However, that does not justify the money spent on the fence. It would be cheaper to spend on a border wall, due to the relatively low prices of cement and the few breakthroughs that would occur.

Reasons to why those people had access to a firearm is because they can. As I stated earlier in round one the second amendment says, "" Because a well-regulated state militia is necessary for the security of a FREE people, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed by the federal government."" Note- In the second amendment the capitalize word ""FREE"" clearly explains why they/anyone can have access to a firearm despite what happens. Man should not be denied or be examined to claim a weapon. Weapons of any kind. - Indeed the man killed those innocent kids/adults may they rest in peace. But little does everyone know the gun that the man carried on the day of the shooting was a secure and legally-owned, belonging to his mother. Now I will present to you a link with a chart of those with crimes of a legal and, illegal firearms. <URL>... And a quick valid statistic of ... six percent of guns taken from arrestees that could properly be considered possible ""crime guns"" that could also have been legally purchased. If it's not clear 6% is a very low number. - For the Chris Dorner manhunt summary you have given us, it's the past and was no longer a top story after several months of the incident. Once a new story comes out, everyone feels the need to bring justice. Moving forward from that statement if there were to be bans on guns through out the United States, increase in home invasions, increase in muggings, increase in car jacks, increase in more violent crimes period will occur. Think about it. Also if guns were to be banned the government would just be taking our rights away, our human rights. With that being said Americans would be weak and weak as a nation.

I would like to thank you for accepting my debate, and I'd also like to thank those that view this debate.  
  
- The shootings that occurred in the past are due to one's right of a firearm. Reasons to why those people had access to a firearm is because they can. As I stated earlier in round one the second amendment says, "" Because a well-regulated state militia is necessary for the security of a FREE people, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed by the federal government."" Note- In the second amendment the capitalize word ""FREE"" clearly explains why they/anyone can have access to a firearm despite what happens. Man should not be denied or be examined to claim a weapon. Weapons of any kind.  
- Indeed the man killed those innocent kids/adults may they rest in peace. But little does everyone know the gun that the man carried on the day of the shooting was a secure and legally-owned, belonging to his mother. Now I will present to you a link with a chart of those with crimes of a legal and, illegal firearms.   http://extranosalley.com...   And a quick valid statistic of ... six percent of guns taken from arrestees that could properly be considered possible ""crime guns"" that could also have been legally purchased. If it's not clear 6% is a very low number.  
  
- For the Chris Dorner manhunt summary you have given us, it's the past and was no longer a top story after several months of the incident. Once a new story comes out, everyone feels the need to bring justice. Moving forward from that statement if there were to be bans on guns through out the United States, increase in home invasions, increase in muggings, increase in car jacks, increase in more violent crimes period will occur. Think about it. Also if guns were to be banned the government would just be taking our rights away, our human rights. With that being said Americans would be weak and weak as a nation. ""James Madison"" father of the Constitution said in Federalists No.46, that the fact that Americans are armed, is an advantage that America has over every other nation.

20,"This is only my second debate on this site, I'm glad we are both getting very helpful experience on the site. Now, onto arguments. 1st. You've split this into two separate arguments, so I will make them into subpoints. a)You state we cannot trust Moiss Nam as a source because he is from a communist country. I would like to know how the nationality of a person destroys the validity of their points? Plus, who better to look to for the enemy's point of view, than the enemy itself? The argument I was trying to make was that communists are effectively making the U.S. the enemy, by using the U.S. as a scapegoat for all Cuba's problems. If anything, we should take this quote into consideration MORE because of the nationality of the speaker, not less. b)In my proponent ""speech"" I stated that the embargo was originally put in place because of land squabbles and to inconvenience the Soviet Union. I still stand by that fact. However, this is what you said in your Round One argument. "" stop trading relations with a country because of its economy (bad), government (usually communist or anti-democratic), or because of profiling (a huge problem with our government). That reasons are the well-being of the country itself, the people, the economy, and government."" I was simply responding to that point. Valid or not, I had to respond to your argument, that is what debate is all about. You heavily suggested that the reason for the embargo was the communist government, and I had to respond. Now, look at what I said at the beginning of round two. ""2nd The negative suggests that we refuse to trade with Cuba because of their communist government."" I made if very clear that this was none of my own saying, but rather it was what you had suggested in your own argument. There are no holes in my argument, and you have therefore agreed with me on the original point of the embargo. Now that we both agree that the embargo was originally enacted for the same reasons, and we agree that it has now evolved into a punishment for communism. Since we agree, we need not discuss this point for the remainder of the debate. 2nd Are you saying we need to simply give up since there is a possibility Raul will live to an extreme age? As of now, Raul has not appointed anyone to succeed him, and the negative side cannot claim that he will do so in the near future. We have no way of knowing. What we DO know is he could die any day now. We need to get rid of this embargo so American influence can reach Cuba and assist in a transition out of tyranny. 3rd O.k...... I agree with you. Communism is the antithesis of American political goals. I think we are just restating what you said in the first point. This offers no reason to keep the embargo. You don't offer any solvency. I don't see what the point of bringing this up was. Now, since this is my last chance to sum things up, I will go ahead and do so. 1.The embargo had two original goals. One has been abandoned; and the second one succeeded but no longer pertains to the status quo (the Soviet Union). 2.The U.S. could benefit from trade with Cuba. Cuba would IMMENSLY benefit from trade with the U.S., and everyone else would benefit from the repealing of the Helms-Burton act. 3.The embargo is unpopular worldwide. This point has not been refuted by the neg and is an automatic win for the affirmative side. 4.This is the cloudiest point, so I would like to expand on it a little more. There is no guarantee that by ending the embargo will end Cuban communism. However, there IS a guarantee that keeping it is doing nothing. For the 50-some years the embargo has been in place, Cuban communism has not ended. The best option here is to end the embargo, and take down the iron curtain we have over Cuba. Diplomatic success with Cuban citizens is not achieved by ignoring them, but it will by achieved by letting our culture and ideals spill over to their island. Vote for affirmative on the following grounds: 1.Ending the embargo would assist with worldwide economies. 2.It would aid U.S.-World relations (especially with communist countries). 3.It would assist Cuba in transitioning to democracy (or some other communism alternative.)

Sorry for just saying Castro in my proponent speech. I am aware that Fidel has given up his reign to his brother Raul, however they are both technically Castro. Sorry for any confusion that may have caused. 1st Nobody is set to succeed Raul, and Raul is currently 79 years old. You say he is set to rule for 20-30 more years. It is possible, but unlikely. He has already trumped the average life expectancy, and most likely will not live until he is 99 as the negative suggests. Please disregard the negative's argument. 2nd The negative suggests that we refuse to trade with Cuba because of their communist government. How do you explain our trade with China, Venezuela, and even North Korea? Cuba, although communist, is not nearly as communist or hostile as some of the other countries we deal with. I would like to repeat the quote from my proponent speech from Moiss Nam, which said, ""The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere."" 3rd The negative argument does not even begin to be competitive to my third point. My point was that the embargo is both domestically and internationally unpopular, but my opponent just pointed out that Cuba is communist, and that's why there is an embargo. I pointed out the actual reason for the embargo in my first speech. Communism is what the embargo has evolved into, not what started it. Please look to my 2nd point above as to why communism is not a good reason for an embargo on Cuba. 4th Our economy was not necessarily sent into a spiral, but Cuba's was.

But yes, if he chooses to run as a third-party or independent candidate, I will vote for him in that capacity, just as 10% of the white male population voted against slavery and for Martin Van Buren in 1848. Did this NOT help bring about slavery's ultimate demise? I think it did. The Founding Fathers did not work ""within the system"" when they seceded from the British Empire. Ron Paul's candidacy may be the last hope for the ""system,"" and after that, other avenues may need to be explored. 2. The parties are the same, as I've illustrated. What is the difference between the parties on fiat money creation? Zero. This is the engine of big government, and they're both 100% on board. Historically, the dominant factions in American politics have been a Hamiltionian centralist party (the Federalists, the Whigs, the early Republicans), and a Jeffersonian ""state's rights"" party (the original Jeffersonian Republicans, the Jacksonian Democrats, parts of the post-Civil War Democratic Party). But beginning with William Jennings Bryan's ascendenscy over Grover Cleveland, and then Wilson's election in 1912, there have been two Hamiltonian factions with very little difference between the two. I will not vote for a fiat-money candidate bought and paid for by the Wall Street bankers. 3. Is everybody but Paul corrupt? That depends on your definition. Some of the others may not know they're corrupt -- they may not understand the nature of central banking, etc. But yes, everyone who buys into and politically profits from the fiat-money counterfeiters is corrupt. Just look at the top contributors of all the major candidates, except Paul. They are investment banks. You think ""Islam"" is the greatest danger to the country -- this blinds you to the ongoing theft being perpetrated by the Federal Reserve System. If you fail to grasp the importance of this issue, then you can inflate the tiny differences between the two parties. But if you recognize that monopolistic control of the money supply and debasement of the currency trump everything else, then you would see that Ron Paul is the only candidate worth voting for. It just so happens that he's right on all the other issues, too. I need to address something you said in Round 2: You think Ron Paul wants to put himself in charge and do things ""by fiat""? Nothing could be further from the truth! Virtually every president since Lincoln has expanded the power of the presidency. Ron Paul would be the first since Grover Cleveland (the best president ever, by the way) to actively work to REDUCE the power of the executive branch and return it to the Congress, the states, and the people. But he would use the power of the veto to slash spending and taxes, and he would use his power as commander in chief to end U.S. imperialism.

What happened to my argument about how you can't use self defense to justify the use of guns? ""No where [sic] in the constitution does it say that the federal government cannot restrict the theatre."" I suggest you read this wiki, or even just the first sentence ( <URL>... ). Although the wiki does need citations, the first sentence is pretty straightforward and good. Now click on the word, ""media."" Read through that, and you will find that it is inclusive. I hate to break it to you, but this isn't Soviet Russia. The government CANNOT censor the media. As much as I'd like to see the government do away with Desperate Housewives and American Idol, it is illegal for the government to do that. ""How do they do it? They can't just say ""All citizens report to the nearest police station and turn all firearms"" because the criminals wouldn't do it anyway and the honest citizens would and how would you propose the unarmed mother protects herself and children should they be attacked? "" Your run-on sentence (sorry, had to be said :-)) is absolutely right. You couldn't just have everyone turn it in. That is utter nonsense. You can see how well abolition worked. What you do is you offer a sizable bounty for each gun turned in, you stop selling guns, and you stop making ammo (or rather, don't allow companies to make and sell guns and ammo to regular citizens). Realistically, you can't get everyone to follow the law, but things would significantly lighten up. Just like if we legalized shoplifting, nobody would pay for anything anymore, but since it is illegal, some people still steal, but most people pay. ""Although, then bow and arrow would be the main method of hunting. Most people I know that hunt are not skilled at using a bow, and I'm afraid that the number of hunting accidents could even increase when hunters are limited to the bow and arrow, since most hunters that use rifles are not skilled at bow hunting."" Sorry to have to take away your fun activity, but what you do is go to the supermarket and buy meat that was shot by someone who works at a farm or something. Those guns would be provided by the government, and obviously, there would be severe punishments if they used it for anything else. Or you could learn to use a bow and arrow. ""...moms who carry pistols in their purses to help protect their children from kidnappers and themselves from robbers is not the answer."" Well, it might be different down where you are, but up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, you'd be thought of as a real redneck and a creep if you did that. I recognize it's different in other areas, but to me, it sounds ludicrous. I mean, I'm a pansy, I know, there has never officially been a murder in my town, but still, that doesn't make guns right. ""To help reduce that, I would suggest at least censorship of music, movies, and plays that promote gang violence, murder, and just violence in general. Heck, let's even add video games to that list. THAT stands more of a chance of success in my eyes."" The government cannot censor the media, BUT, if you get rid of guns, the amount of that media will inevitably go down. Wow! Round 3 already!

I suggest you read this wiki, or even just the first sentence (  http://en.wikipedia.org...  ). Although the wiki does need citations, the first sentence is pretty straightforward and good. Now click on the word, ""media."" Read through that, and you will find that it is inclusive. I hate to break it to you, but this isn't Soviet Russia. The government CANNOT censor the media. As much as I'd like to see the government do away with Desperate Housewives and American Idol, it is illegal for the government to do that.  
  
""How do they do it? They can't just say ""All citizens report to the nearest police station and turn all firearms"" because the criminals wouldn't do it anyway and the honest citizens would and how would you propose the unarmed mother protects herself and children should they be attacked? ""  
Your run-on sentence (sorry, had to be said :-)) is absolutely right. You couldn't just have everyone turn it in. That is utter nonsense. You can see how well abolition worked. What you do is you offer a sizable bounty for each gun turned in, you stop selling guns, and you stop making ammo (or rather, don't allow companies to make and sell guns and ammo to regular citizens). Realistically, you can't get everyone to follow the law, but things would significantly lighten up. Just like if we legalized shoplifting, nobody would pay for anything anymore, but since it is illegal, some people still steal, but most people pay.  
  
""Although, then bow and arrow would be the main method of hunting. Most people I know that hunt are not skilled at using a bow, and I'm afraid that the number of hunting accidents could even increase when hunters are limited to the bow and arrow, since most hunters that use rifles are not skilled at bow hunting.""  
Sorry to have to take away your fun activity, but what you do is go to the supermarket and buy meat that was shot by someone who works at a farm or something. Those guns would be provided by the government, and obviously, there would be severe punishments if they used it for anything else. Or you could learn to use a bow and arrow.  
  
""...moms who carry pistols in their purses to help protect their children from kidnappers and themselves from robbers is not the answer.""  
Well, it might be different down where you are, but up in Lake Oswego, Oregon, you'd be thought of as a real redneck and a creep if you did that. I recognize it's different in other areas, but to me, it sounds ludicrous. I mean, I'm a pansy, I know, there has never officially been a murder in my town, but still, that doesn't make guns right.  
  
""To help reduce that, I would suggest at least censorship of music, movies, and plays that promote gang violence, murder, and just violence in general. Heck, let's even add video games to that list. THAT stands more of a chance of success in my eyes.""  
The government cannot censor the media, BUT, if you get rid of guns, the amount of that media will inevitably go down.

34,"So it seems I've taken the resolution a little off-topic from where the instigator intended for it to go. Very well, I do not think it will hurt my case or my position in this debate -- As Con, I must prove why advocates of universal health care should NOT also be advocating for universal food, shelter or clothing. Got it. Well consider R1 to be a detailed explanation of why advocates of UHC are calling for it in the first place, and they are not ""nuts"" but rather concerned (and sometimes desperate) Americans who are enforcing their constitutional right to call for change. In terms of this debate, Pro has asked that I explain the so-called inconsistency of singling out health care by wanting to make health care universal, whereas other basic human needs like food and clothing are above health care in terms of the hierarchy of necessity, yet people aren't advocating for socialized shelter. First, as I've pointed out, universal food, shelter and clothing are already provided to those in need by the government. Pro notes, ""But none of these programs provide these core necessities to everyone universally."" This is true; one must qualify and meet the living standards deemed appropriate to receive ""free"" food and shelter. However this is because there is not enough funding in the tax budget to distribute to everyone but those who are deemed in dire need. #1 - Americans don't want to raise taxes for universal food, shelter and clothing, because that would essentially turn us into a communist nation. Specifically making health care universal would NOT turn us into a communist nation, as is demonstrated by other countries who implement universal health care and are not communist (i.e. Canada, Britain and France). #2 - One could buy food to live with just a few dollars a day; however, some medical care and costs can be thousands upon thousands of dollars, putting families into debt and/or causing them to seek no treatment at all (which may cost them their health/lives). Prescription drugs, operations or other medical procedures, doctor visits, etc. are all a lot more expensive than these basic needs, especially because there are often no alternatives. ... For instance, if I broke a bone and needed surgery, there is no getting around that. But if I'm hungry and can't afford a gourmet meal or even a fast food meal, there's always the option of buying a bag of Ramen noodles for 25 cents, or in a moment of desparation, even taking left-over food out of the trash (such as some homeless people often resort to). However while one can build a make-shift place to live (even from a cardboard box) and survive, one cannot perform heart surgery on themselves, for instance, thus making health care a greater need. The same example applies to buying a t-shirt at a craft store for $2 as opposed to an Armani shirt for $200. Third, keep in mind that not only the impoverished can benefit from universal health care. The middle class often cannot afford health insurnace while they CAN afford food, shelter and clothing. Thus my opponent has tried to conclude that it is not logical for one to support universal health care and not support universal food; however, he is trying to draw a link where there is none. While I do deem food a greater necessity than health care in general (in terms of life or death), that does not mean that we - as a nation - need universal food more than we need universal health care. So again, offering universal food, clothing and shelter would turn us into a communist nation. We already have programs that offer assistance in these areas to those in dire need. However the establishment of universal health care would NOT turn us into a communist nation. Instead, it would eliminate the high cost charged by insurance companies, and we'd pay less money for (at least) equal or better health care. Everyone would receive this benefit - not just the rich, and not just the poor. Keep in mind that making health care universal could/would probably increase the salary one earns, because offering health insurance would no longer be a perk of a job offer. They'd have to find other incentives to reward their employees with. Hmm. All-in-all, I have pointed out why universal health care is a good idea, while offering universal food, clothing and shelter is not. Universal health care would SAVE people money, whereas the taxation from all of those other goods would cost people money. It also just doesn't make sense in general, whereas universal health care does make sense.

My opponent suggests that discrimination law should not apply to POTUS. However, discrimination law exists to protect everyone from sexual discrimination. Sterilization is not a reasonable request, for it is a permanent and drastic correction for a problem that does not exist at time of employment. Such a measure would constitute unlawful discrimination against women. The assertion that civil rights should not apply to the President is an interesting one, but fails due to the fact that POTUS is a citizen, not to mention that the office is an example. What a poor example to set if the highest office were to discriminate against women. ""the legality of the issue is not relevant to the argument"" I agree in as far as my opponent has already conceded the debate. If they had not done so, I submit they would need to find a reason why a civil rights law should be wiped off the books. B. My opponent assumes that POTUS would take six weeks maternity leave. This assumption is unwarranted. E. ""What if the electorate saw fit to elect someone under the age of 35 into the White House? This is an impossibility because of laws that prevent such an occurrence. The electorate does NOT have the democratic right to elect such a person to the office of POTUS."" Granted and irrelevant. The electorate might still see fit to elect a pregnant woman to the White House. F. ""Again, resignation is a choice, one that the POTUS can easily not make.

This assumption is unwarranted.  E.   ""What if the electorate saw fit to elect someone under the age of 35 into the White House? This is an impossibility because of laws that prevent such an occurrence. The electorate does NOT have the democratic right to elect such a person to the office of POTUS.""  Granted and irrelevant. The electorate might still see fit to elect a pregnant woman to the White House.  F.    ""Again, resignation is a choice, one that the POTUS can easily not make.

47,"I accept your challenge and look forward to this debate. Where as we established no rules as what the rounds shall be for, I will only offer my case on the first round and save rebuttals for later. I would like to start by saying, I am not entirely in favor of Obama in fact in most ways I disagree with him. I will however play devils advocate in this debate and promote his policies, the ideology behind it(as worded in title), and how they have helped or ideologically could help our society. I will now establish my points. I would use more but I would run out of space so I will focus on 4 main points. I will ignore how these could actually effect us and merely show the ideology behind it, since per the title I am allowed. Let us define ideology. Also let me define the word Ideology Definition of Ideolgy 1: visionary theorizing (1) Redistribution, (2) Obamacare and healthcare(slang word for reform), (3) Energy policy, (4) Immigration policy (1) Redistribution of wealth at its core, is the framework of socialism.

49,"First off, thank you for starting what is sure to be a very interesting and intellectual debate. Although I do have reservations about this, for the purposes of this debate, I will debate as if I do not have those reservations. So, I think we can agree that there are two main types of firearm: Assault weapons and hunting weapons. I'm sure there are more descriptive terms (and I could be completely wrong; correct me ifthat is the case), but I'm not well versed in Gun. I've never shot one in my 35 years of existence, and I don't plan to in my remaining 300 (or so). So, I definitely cannot see why someone would need an assault weapon. If I am correct in my idea of an assault weapon, it is one specifically made to kill other people. Yes, those can be used for self defense, but even from a pro-gun stance, you can just as easy pick up your hunting rifle (obviously that wouldn't work from my stance, but I'm just establishing the question of why anyone would need an assault weapon). Oddly enough, it seems most murders are committed with assault weapons.you have to attack the root of the problem. Those are the assault weapons. Now, it is hard to justify my stance on hunting weapons, but I still have tricks up my sleeve. Obviously people enjoy hunting, and it would be hard to take that right away, but it goes wrong just a little too often. Imagine this scenario: A hunter (let's call him Jed) is hunting with his son (let's call him Buck). Buck has gone hunting a few times, and Jed is a lifetime hunter. So, Buck hits a really big, well, buck and so he needs help getting it up. Jed goes over to help. So, Buck is inexperienced, so he is fumbling around the gun to find the safety. He finds it eventually, but in the process, he accidentally pulls the trigger. The bullet missed Jed's face by a mere 2 inches (sorry, I don't like hurting or killing people). It's simply too risky to allow dangerous things like that. Didn't like that one?

50,"I thank Feverish for accepting this debate. I would first like to point out that the Princeton dictionary lists 4 different definitions for Nationalism and to fit under a definition, one must only meet a single definition, not all of them. So the one that he listed is not the only definition for Nationalism that would need to be met. The 4 deffinitions are [1]... *patriotism: love of country and willingness to sacrifice for it; ""they rode the same wave of popular patriotism""; ""British nationalism was in the air and patriotic sentiments ran high"" *the doctrine that your national culture and interests are superior to any other *the aspiration for national independence felt by people under foreign domination *the doctrine that nations should act independently (rather than collectively) to attain their goals And we also find other definitions elsewhere. And we can see a simple trend in the definitions. It is a philosophy centered around a desire of national identification (meaning having an independent state) focused on either region, culture, or the current government. Since we are talking about ""White Nationalism"" this should obviously focus down to culture, since there is no ""White"" region in the world. And since ""white nationalism"" is often viewed against ""multiculturalism,"" that only more strongly affirms that WN is focused around cultures. I would disagree that White Nationalism is exculsively focused around the belief that a white culture is superior to every other culture. We can see from the many definitions, that ""superiority"" only really pops un in one of the many definitions. I would like to open arguments by looking at various types of Nationalism in history, to show that ""superiority"" over others in not inherent to that word. Particularly, Irish nationalism and the American Revolution. Irish Nationalism [2] - ""political and social movements and sentiment inspired by a love for Irish culture, language and history, and a sense of pride in Ireland and the Irish people. Today, the term generally refers to support for a united Ireland."" Please note, that none of this involves a sence of superiority or a claim of ""we're better than you."" In fact, most Irish Nationalist, while many do hold some resentment against Britian (namely because they view Britian as the obsticle in preventing them from having their own nation), they really don't hold anything any view against American culture, or Chinese culture, or really any other culture. If we go to the American revolution, that was also a large nationalist movement to gain independence from England and to establish their own nation so that they could have their own rights. They did not view that they were superior to everyone else (I'm sure some individuals did, but the movement as a whole did not) [3]. If we expand that understanding of ""nationalism"" to ""white nationalism,"" we see that white nationalism is really nothing more than the advocacy of a national identity of the white culture (remember, that nationalism is tied to either culture or region). We then come to having to ask, what is ""white culture"" and does it even exist? It may sound strange, since, in America, we are very much ""multi-cultured,"" though we can get an idea that white culture does exist by looking at other cultures that we clearly know exist. We can clearly see that there is a hispanic culture, and that there is an african culture, and that there is an asian culture, and that there is a native american culture, so it should be only all too natural that there would be a white culture too. And within each of those larger cultures, there are many subcultures. For example, Chinese culture and Japanese culture, both fall under ""asian culture"" but are still different. And so we would also expect different subcultures within white culture. Third, I'd like to point out that wanting a place of your own (in this case, for your own culture) does not mean that you view others (in this case, other cultures) as infearior. If I want a house just for myself, that does not mean that I want my neighbor to not have a house, or that I think I'm better than him. It simply means that I would like a place of my own, and I can have no problem with him having a place of his own, or, if he would like, he is free to live in a community dwelling (i.e. multiculturalism). We can see this mentality a lot on state levels. Many states have different views on medical marrijuana, or minimum wage, or what have you. And so many of them choose what they want for themselves and they don't go trying to force other states to change. We see this a lot on the national level. We have our ""house"" (our nation) and we do with it as we please, and we don't try to force every other nation to do what we think is best (minus the occational dictator or two). This shows that we can have a single view for improving ourselves, without trying to force those views on others. This is what white nationalists want, a national identity for a white culture, whether that is in the US adopting that (most white nationalists), or having a small area break away and form an independent nation (white seperatists). They (for the most part) do not view other cultures as ""infearior"" but merely as ""different"" and that the differences should be respected and preserved. After all, we try to preseve our history, our environment, and most minority cultures (like some native american culture on reserves), so why can we not find a place to preserve a ""white culture""?

You fellows go into the schools and teach children the gay lifestyle is wonderful and cool Again, people who go into schools, broadening children's minds about what a healthy relationship can be, reaching out to all Gay teens who are struggling with their sexuality and need these people's support, are not saying it is ""cool"". They are simply saying that it is a viable way to live, and these people shouldn't be ashamed of themselves and hide themselves away, which could possibly damage them further. Gay pride parades are a good example of this. Perhaps if you'd explain why they're a good Idea you'd have an argument. I don't need to. You have the BOP to say why they are bad, sick and twisted, which you haven't done. But, for the sake of it, Gay pride events are good because they allow Gay people, who don't have the same rights as heterosexual people, to stand up for what they believe in. You then go on to say about gay bath houses, etc, which only some gay people utilise. It is like saying that heterosexuals are all sex orientated because some go to prostitutes. You are using your own subjective opinions here, and are not using actual facts! Show us a gay event that isn't sex oriented. In another debate I called gays a ""sex cult"". Yes you did. That was factually inaccurate as most Gay people can have long and healthy relationships. Really, your arguments here are based all on assumptions and generalisations with no support to them. A normal homosexual relationship isn't sex orientated, just a heterosexual one isn't. Both contain two consenting adults who love each other. Sex is really just an optional way to deepen that love. Here's the point: when news sites carry imagery that glorifies homosexuality, they're glorifying a life-style that is destructive and dehumanizing. A recent CDC report showed that young gay males are 72.% of all new HIV cases. This means homosexuality is a major public health hazard. They aren't glorifying it! Again, for the third time, they are simply allowing those who are Gay a relateable person. Yes, Gay people may be the biggest contributor to HIV rates at the moment, but that does not mean that we shouldn't allow them to have relationships. If we teach these children about safe sex, what they should be having anyway, then there would be no problem. Just because people from African countries statistically have a higher chance to get Aids doesn't mean we should stop them from having relationships.",1,RossM,"
  
  Yes, Con is correct, Gay people do exist, along with muggers, thieves, murderers etc. The arrogance which he has, to claim that a loving relationship between two consenting adults is the same as taking someone's belongings/life is beyond compare.

The military should not be burdened with having to prove an actual event, so male homosexual activity should remain banned in it's entirety. I will pass on the financial aspect.

You obviously haven't seen the basis of this, even though I stated it in the same paragraph. 97% of HIV rates were found in Africa or low-middle countries, where they can't afford to educate their children about safe sex. This means that the homosexuals in that country who have HIV and go on to have sex will spread that around. It is not misdirection, it is a logical procession from the information we have. Therefore the HIV rates found in homosexuals will also rise significantly. You need to do more research in this case sir. ""My opponent tell us gays have ""long and healthy relationships"", but if that is so, how does he explain 72.% of all new HIV cases are gay males?"" See above for the third answer to this question. SUMMATION: My opponent here uses lack luster points about the LGBT community, assuming that all of their relationships are loveless and are all sex based. He fails to see how the representation of Gay people in the media will help those who are ashamed of their sexuality to be confident in who they are, and how it will remove hate and discrimination in the future. He also does not see how it is the job of the news to show our diverse society, which is the basis for the pictures found in the Huffington post.

Therefore the HIV rates found in homosexuals will also rise significantly. You need to do more research in this case sir.  
  ""My opponent tell us gays have ""long and healthy relationships"", but if that is so, how does he explain 72.% of all new HIV cases are gay males?""  
  See above for the third answer to this question.  
  SUMMATION:  
  My opponent here uses lack luster points about the LGBT community, assuming that all of their relationships are loveless and are all sex based. He fails to see how the representation of Gay people in the media will help those who are ashamed of their sexuality to be confident in who they are, and how it will remove hate and discrimination in the future. He also does not see how it is the job of the news to show our diverse society, which is the basis for the pictures found in the Huffington post.  
  Just as a last note, what my opponent did in his last paragraphs is frankly disgusting. The bigotry which he is showing is bordering on an obsession, and,   once again  , he assumes that if I win, it will only be due to the voters who, in his words, ""must be Gay"".

60,"First of all, I would like to say how pleased I am that Mr. Latham decided to accept this debate as I recently took the time to post a serious debate only to get an opponent who replied with a load of old nonsense in return. True, I won the debate, but I would rather lose to a worthy opponent than win by default. Nevertheless, I will still try and win this one by addressing Mr. Latham's rebuttals as follows: 1 - The term investment bank seems to still being used in the media to describe banks, or the divisions of banks, that deal with institutional investors and high net worth individuals rather than provide bank accounts, loans and mortgages for ordinary customers. In any case, when these banks were bailed out they certainly were known as investment banks. <URL>... 2 - There is only one thing that bankers hate more than paying tax and that is what they would describe as ""government interference in their affairs"". That is why some banks were reluctant to take the public cash offered them - they suspected that the government would demand some control over how their business was run in the future. However, given their woeful record of catastrophic mismanagement over the preceding years, the government had no option but to persuade them to accept the money and ask them to use it to recapitalize themselves. The reason why some banks had to be coerced into this is that the banking industry which is a public utility as well as a commercial venture and a collapse would have caused a total economic meltdown. It is also true that Goldman and Morgan took relatively little compared to others such as Bank of America. On the other hand, banks such as Barclays Capital took absolutely nothing and even bought much of Lehman's business off the administrators. However, the point is that the banks that were loaned money took it on the understanding that they would use it to recapitalize in order to prevent any repetition of the financial chaos that had ensued - it was certainly never intended that profits earned on the loans would be distributed between the very bankers who were responsible for the collapse. 3 - Goldman wanted to repay their loans as quickly as possible so that they could release themselves from any government intervention and thus be free to pay themselves huge bonuses. This is why Goldman's 30,000 UK employees will get an average 500,000 ($820,000) each, although in reality, the bonuses will not go to the back office boys and girls or the folks that work in the post room or staff restaurant, but instead be will be divided between the top traders in multiples of tens of millions. That is exactly the type of bad management decision that caused the economic collapse in the first place - the banks should be using that money to recapitalize themselves in case the recession is 'W'-shaped and they need cash to sustain themselves through more lean times. The fact is that these banks were financed by the public and have a duty to act responsibly in return. They have not discharged this duty and should, therefore, suffer the consequences in the form of a windfall tax. 4 - A windfall tax may be unconstitutional in the US - my opponent is American and I am not so I will not argue with him on that point. However, a windfall tax was applied to the banks in the UK in 1981 under similar economic circumstances. <URL>... 5 - A condition of the bail out of the banking industry, the top executives did, indeed, agree to limit their pay - in other words ""mend their ways"". They have reneged on this agreement but the government must take some of the blame for this because they should never have trusted them in the first place - they should have made it a legally binding agreement - after all, a typical bankers' whole raison d'tre is to let nothing stand in their way of making as much money for themselves as possible - they have no sense of social responsibility, indeed, it could be said that their consciences are their accomplices rather than their guides! 6 - The 50% would be taken on post-tax profits. So if a bank announces that it has made a $50 billion profit after tax, $25 billion will then be due to the government and $25 billion will be for the bank to either recapitalize themselves or, as is more likely, to pay themselves (still massive) bonuses. This is the reason why regulation to moderate remuneration will still be required. 7 - The difference between an overpaid rock star or sportsman and an investment banker is that if a celebrity chooses to spend his money on private planes and ocean-going yachts and lavish parties rather than invest it sensibly and they go to the wall as a result, it is only they that suffer. However, when banking executives do the same we all suffer. In conclusion, I accept that windfall taxes are inherently unfair - if they are applied retrospectively to squeeze money out of prudent companies who have made big profits as the result of their own endeavours. That is why I do not propose to apply such taxes to banks such as Barclays Capital who didn't have recourse to the public purse because they were able to sustain themselves through, and even profit from, the collapse of the banking industry. It is only the incompetent, greedy banks that were obliged to go cap in hand to their governments and who now, despite all that has happened, are awarding themselves massive payouts, that should be subject to a windfall tax.

62,"First of all let me begin my addressing by opponent's opening quote by Thomas Jefferson. Thomas Jefferson was a staunch non-interventionist and believed that although we should promote healthy relationships with all nations.. we should have entangling alliances with none. Therefore any evidence relating to works of this Founding Father belong to the negative. Moving on to my opponents first point relating to the fact that if government is amoral then it also must have amoral policies. This statement is absolutely correct. Allow me to explain. The definition of morality as accepted by my opponent is "" a duty to act based on one's beliefs"" to allow government to have ""personal beliefs"" is to threaten the justice of which my opponent so highly speaks. Consider the Spanish Inquisition. During this time period the government took on the morality of the Catholic church, and as such felt that it was the GOVERNMENT's OBLIGATION to promote this religious morality. The end result was unlimited government which was permitted to torture, burn, drown, and destroy those who opposed this morality. We cannot put a moral face on government without jeopardizing human rights and justice. Speaking of justice... my opponent upholds that Justice and morality are basically one and the same. However I disagree. Once established, government becomes a monopoly regarding coercive force. There's nothing optional about government. Government is the arbiter of justice, and justice is based on laws, police, prosecutors, courts, jail and other penalties. Justice might possibly claim to be 'informed' by morality, but for the reasons already stated, justice is not morality. Only institutions composed of one or more people who have made the free will decisions to associate can arbitrate morality, because according to the accepted definition of morality only individuals can make personal decisions relating to their duty. This is why government is an institution of laws not of morals. Under this point, my opponent affirmed that ""Human rights legislation and capital punishment laws are other important areas of government action that cannot be separated from moral concerns."" However as was seen earlier in my example of the Spanish Inquisition, if we base our human rights legislation off what particular individuals believe to be moral it may actually violate human rights. For example, the Islamic form of government is based of the Koran, which is the Islamic code of morality, however as can be seen in recent events, this religion violates human rights. The majority of my opponent's response deals with the issue that aid to foreign nations, actually does protect national sovereignty. This is precisely the point that I explained in my 2nd Contention. Government has an obligation to protect from dangers without. If that means supplying assistance to our allies then it definitely falls under the protection of national sovereignty and of the citizens. However, when government is obligated to provide aid to EVERY country which is in need it forces government to look outside the needs of its own people and obligates it to provide aid to every nation, even those who may be our enemy and will use this aid for our destruction. If individuals seek to provide aid to those suffering in other countries.. indeed let them do so. Charity belongs to the individual not to the institution of government. Finally, I will respond to my opponents rebuttal of my Rwanda Example. The impacts of a serious string of actions violating national sovereignty has lasting impacts. Violence had been taking place before the actual genocide, however the outburst of feelings and resentment finally boiled over in 1994. So although the storm was several decades in coming, the actions of Belgium in the disruption of Rwanda's social structure was a key contributing factor to the Genocide. Therefore, my example still stands. I will conclude with a quote by President George Washington from his Farewell Address ""Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification""",1,Pepsi94,"

The majority of my opponent's response deals with the issue that aid to foreign nations, actually does protect national sovereignty. This is precisely the point that I explained in my 2nd Contention. Government has an obligation to protect from dangers without. If that means supplying assistance to our allies then it definitely falls under the protection of national sovereignty and of the citizens. However, when government is obligated to provide aid to EVERY country which is in need it forces government to look outside the needs of its own people and obligates it to provide aid to every nation, even those who may be our enemy and will use this aid for our destruction.  If individuals seek to provide aid to those suffering in other countries.. indeed let them do so. Charity belongs to the individual not to the institution of government.   Finally, I will respond to my opponents rebuttal of my Rwanda Example. The impacts of a serious string of actions violating national sovereignty has lasting impacts. Violence had been taking place before the actual genocide, however the outburst of feelings and resentment finally boiled over in 1994. So although the storm was several decades in coming, the actions of Belgium in the disruption of Rwanda's social structure was a key contributing factor to the Genocide. Therefore, my example still stands.   I will conclude with a quote by President George Washington from his Farewell Address     ""Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification""",Politics,1,Resolved-Government-has-a-Moral-Obligation-to-Assist-Nations-in-Need/1/,31341

67,"I apologize for not posting in video/audio form, but i don't have access to a camera at the moment and I promise that my AC is in time. I affirm. I offer the following definitions to clarify the round: Felon: a person who has committed an act deemed illegal by that person's government Democratic Society: Society governed by all citizens using the system of voting Democratic: the ability to have a say in what action is occurring Right: an ability or state you can maintain because a government enforces that ability or state Equality: the quality of being the same in measure, value or status Observation: The resolution states ""felons ought to retain the right...in a democratic society"" This does NOT mean any society we currently are residing in or know of today. The resolution does NOT state that United States felons ought to retain the right to vote, nor that any other specific members of specific societies are relevant to this debate. The value for the round is Human Rights as defined by the UN Declaration of Human Rights. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations released said declaration, setting a standard for all democratic and non-democratic nations everywhere. It has 30 total articles, but for this debate I will focus on the following: ""Article 21, Sub Point 3: The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures"" To put it simply, all people should have the right to vote in any governmental election. This also has been clearly acknowledged as a human right. The Criterion is Equality. Democracy is founded upon the principle of equality, since equality shows that all people are of the same value. Democratic acts allow all people to have an EQUAL say in what is occurring. This proves a direct relation to the resolution and therefore is the clear, best choice for today's criterion. Contention 1: ""Felons are still citizens"" Therefore, we cannot rightfully discredit a felon's input on government simply because they have committed a crime. The basic purpose of voting is to gather input from citizens on the issues of their society, and if even one member of that society is a felon, they should still have the right to vote because they are still a citizen, they still are counted in the population and they still experience the results of the election. Furthermore, the commission of a felony does not render a felon incapable of having opinions on other social issues, thus a felon's opinion is still relevant to the society and therefore the felon should retain the right to vote. Because of this, equality is better upheld on the affirmative. Contention 2: ""The Prison system is a punishment system"" All people that are convicted of a felony are given a proper punishment based on the severity of the crime committed. If we were to add a separate and additional punishment to a punishment that they already have served, we are destroying the very system used to judge felons. Adding an addition punishment is destructive of a democratic society because it is neither equal nor democratic, as not all felons have committed the same crime. If we were to negate the resolution, we might as well stick all felons in prison for the rest of their lives because we aren't trusting them to do anything after they have been labeled a felon. Because negating is NOT proportional, equality is better upheld by affirming the resolution. Contention 3: ""Rational Choice Theory"" Rational Choice Theory is the basic process that a person does all the time. It basically shows that citizens only do something that is more beneficial to them than not. In this case, Rational Choice Theory can be applied in the way citizens vote. There is the intense (primary) benefit that each citizen has in an election, (like gay marriage for a homosexual voter or banning abortion for a pro-life voter,) an intrinsic (secondary) benefit, (meaning an issue that the voter has a stance on, but is not high priority) and a voting cost. (Like taking the time to register, standing in line or even filling out the ballot.) Citizens will only vote when the benefits outweigh the costs. The warrants and impacts for this are as follows; affirming allows all voters who have the moral and social standards to suffer the costs of voting in order to cast their vote. Negating however decreases the number of good voters (felon or not) by not retaining their right to vote. Equality is better upheld by the affirmative because all voters are given the ability to cast an equal vote if they choose to.

My opponent stated ""It doesn't matter if her actions was immoral or not; this is not the topic of this Debate."" Well, that is the topic. Her immoral actions were illegal. They were the same immoral actions committed by other Americans who got convicted. Which is why she should be convicted, ergo she should go to prison. In this case the lack of conviction and lack of a prison sentence go hand in hand.  
  
My opponents also stated ""People aren't imprisoned for behaving immorally or unethically, unless they have committed a criminal offence.""

Though it is stereotypical, to a certain extent, to claim that all youth drivers are inherently worse than adult drivers (as we've all seen our fair share of terrible adult drivers), the statistics on the matter prove that youth drivers are more likely to commit driving errors than those of older demographics [1] [2]. The same rationale is used when marking any hazardous vehicle. We mark student driver cars extensively for the same reason (note that we haven't seen any molestation sprees spurred by predators following around student driver vehicles). This is a tactic, in fact, that will encourage more defensive driving, since drivers around the youth will be able to compensate for a possible lack of experience.

75,"""The embargo has been a failure by every measure. It has not changed the course or nature of the Cuban government. It has not liberated a single Cuban citizen. In fact, the embargo has made the Cuban people a bit more impoverished, without making them one bit more free. At the same time, it has deprived Americans of their freedom to travel and has cost US farmers and other producers billions of dollars of potential exports."" These are the words of Daniel Griswold in 2009, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies. First of all, I'd like to clarify what I mean when I say I want to lift the embargo. I intend to: Repeal the Cuban Democracy Act Repeal the Helms-Burton Act Amend the Foreign Assistance Act to exclude Cuba Amend the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 to exclude Cuba I would also like to clarify that this is not only ending the economic embargo, but also the travel embargo. This debate will be centered around these points: 1. The Embargo has already met some of it's original aims. Those that it has not met, it will not meet. 2. This is not only an economic problem in the U.S. and Cuba, (which it is), but it is also a worldwide economic problem. 3. The Embargo is internationally and domestically unpopular. 4. Ending the travel embargo with help with a transition to democracy. 1. The Original Aims of the Embargo. The embargo was first put in place in the 60's for two reasons. The first was to punish Cuba for seizing property owned by Americans. In 2001, Cuban Officials offered to compensate those Americans whose property was taken. For reasons unknown, this offer was declined. This goal has evidently been abandoned. The second reason was to make it costlier and more of a hassle for the Soviet Union to fund and participate with Cuba. This part worked wonderfully, it is estimated to have cost the Soviet Union six billion dollars a year. However, the S.U. disbanded in 1991, so this is no longer an issue. The only plausible reason the Embargo is still in place is to try and punish Cuba until it ceases to be Communist. This has failed for the past 48 years, and will continue to fail until Castro dies. 2. Obviously this is an economic problem in the U.S. and Cuba. This seems to be self-evident and I'd rather not try to expand on it. However, I would like to explain why this is an international economic problem. The Helms-Burton Act stops any company from dealing with the U.S. and Cuba at the same time. Obviously, this company is going to choose the bigger market; the U.S. Not only does this negatively affect Cuba and it's citizens, but it also affects foreign companies. It does nothing to aid international relations, and only aids the increase of international deficit. 3. In 2009 Moiss Nam, Editor-In-Chief of Foreign Policy Magazine and Former Venezuelan Minister of Development, said ""The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere.""

""The embargo has been a failure by every measure. It has not changed the course or nature of the Cuban government. It has not liberated a single Cuban citizen. In fact, the embargo has made the Cuban people a bit more impoverished, without making them one bit more free. At the same time, it has deprived Americans of their freedom to travel and has cost US farmers and other producers billions of dollars of potential exports."" These are the words of Daniel Griswold in 2009, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies.  
  
First of all, I'd like to clarify what I mean when I say I want to lift the embargo.  
I intend to:  
Repeal the Cuban Democracy Act  
Repeal the Helms-Burton Act  
Amend the Foreign Assistance Act to exclude Cuba  
Amend the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 to exclude Cuba  
  
I would also like to clarify that this is not only ending the economic embargo, but also the travel embargo.  
  
This debate will be centered around these points:  
1. The Embargo has already met some of it's original aims. Those that it has not met, it will not meet.  
  
2. This is not only an economic problem in the U.S. and Cuba, (which it is), but it is also a worldwide economic problem.  
  
3. The Embargo is internationally and domestically unpopular.  
  
4. Ending the travel embargo with help with a transition to democracy.  
  
1. The Original Aims of the Embargo.  
The embargo was first put in place in the 60's for two reasons. The first was to punish Cuba for seizing property owned by Americans. In 2001, Cuban Officials offered to compensate those Americans whose property was taken. For reasons unknown, this offer was declined. This goal has evidently been abandoned.  
The second reason was to make it costlier and more of a hassle for the Soviet Union to fund and participate with Cuba. This part worked wonderfully, it is estimated to have cost the Soviet Union six billion dollars a year. However, the S.U. disbanded in 1991, so this is no longer an issue.  
The only plausible reason the Embargo is still in place is to try and punish Cuba until it ceases to be Communist. This has failed for the past 48 years, and will continue to fail until Castro dies.  
  
2. Obviously this is an economic problem in the U.S. and Cuba. This seems to be self-evident and I'd rather not try to expand on it. However, I would like to explain why this is an international economic problem.  
The Helms-Burton Act stops any company from dealing with the U.S. and Cuba at the same time. Obviously, this company is going to choose the bigger market; the U.S. Not only does this negatively affect Cuba and it's citizens, but it also affects foreign companies. It does nothing to aid international relations, and only aids the increase of international deficit.  
  
3. In 2009 Moisï¿½s Naï¿½m, Editor-In-Chief of Foreign Policy Magazine and Former Venezuelan Minister of Development, said ""The embargo is the perfect example used by anti-Americans everywhere to expose the hypocrisy of a superpower that punishes a small island while cozying to dictators elsewhere.""  
The United Nations has voted 19 years in a row over 90% in favor of ending the embargo. During the last voting session this year (2010), only the U.S. and Israel voted to keep it in place, with only three other U.S. allies abstinentating. Also, according to a poll done by CNN, a majority of Americans want the travel embargo lifted.

Pure socialism: Pure Socialism involves a centrally planned economic system, which requires a government controlled population of workers to operate the system. Therefore Socialism is both an economic system and a government system....

Under pure socialism, the concept of free-economy is virtually non-existent. The government sets all prices, the government sets all wages, the government decides on the jobs that workers will be performing. Therefore, there is little to none incentive for a person to be more productive or to strive for excellence. In a pure socialist state people do not start their own business. Competition has no effect as prices are set by the government and are presumably equal across each industry. This would destroy the incentive to improve services provided to the customer. ""The customer is always right"" would cease to exist. Who would pay the price for this? The consumer. This would of course also affect export, as the quality of American goods and services would suffer. Since the government decides who will perform which job, people will be inherently unhappy as they will not have the luxury of choosing their desired career path. The very concept of socialism relies on the principle that everyone is equal. This in itself is a myth. People are not equal. That may be sad but it's true. Some are smarter than others. Some are stronger than others. Some are more prone to diseases. Some are born disabled. Some are considered more sexually appealing than others. Some are more friendly than others. Some are susceptible to addictions more than others. The very concept of attempting to equalise people is flawed. It is also inefficient. It will arugably deprive the community of economic ""natural selection"" where those with the highest capacity and a proven record are given the most responsible positions. One could argue that the government could take care of that. However, just how humongous would a beaurocratic machine have to be for it to be able to conduct such a massive task? It would be huge and inefficient. Government officials would be extremely prone to corruption, bribery would be rife. While government-subsidised health care is a great concept, a pure socialist system goes way beyond this. Health-care professionals who are limited by equalised, government-set wages will not seek to excel as there is simply no incentive. There is no prospect of finding a better paid job in a better health care facility. Many will simply flee the country and look for work abroad, where they feel more free and appreciated. Again, the government might be able to allow higher wages to better-performing health-care centres. And again, this would require a huge government machine, again prone to corruption and bribery. Education is perhaps the weakest point in my argument. Educators around the world are notoriously underpaid in any economic system and arguably the educational systems of existing socialist countries do rival those of capitalist nations. But what will happen with those who have attained that education? Will they stick around and work in a government-owned organisation and get paid their government-set wages? Or will they flee the USA and look for work somewhere where competition amongst employers gives rise to more attractive job offers? I believe the answer to this question is quite obvious. All this would result in an inefficient economy and a very unhappy society. This is so in particular for a country like the United States where people value their freedoms so highly, where people consider themselves something of a world-model for freedom, individualism and justice. I am not suggesting that this image is in fact correct. Nor am I suggesting that it is not. However, I do contend that these concepts are so enshrined in the American psyche that the people of the USA would never be happy in a system where they are told to all be equal, where they are deprived of their individualism, where they are deprived of any incentive to excel, where they are deprived of the right to start an enterprise, to reap the benefits of their own ideas. Given that my opponent has already forfeited a round and has given no sign of life, I will stop here. In light of all the above factors (and there are more, many more) I conclude that pure socialism could never work a country like the United States of America, if indeed it could work anywhere. I might qualify this statement by saying that in a perfect society with perfect people (who indeed are all equal in every aspect) a system of this type might in fact work.

78,"Marine_to_be: first off, congratulations on your decision to join the armed forces. I think that being a part of the military is an important and honorable career -- cheers! Now I will attempt to address each of your individual points mentioned in your argument. First, yes I do remember 9/11. But I don't remember Iraq being any more involved than the United States were. If I recall, it was members of the Taliban from Afghanistan that were responsible for the tragedy in my hometown of New York City -- not Iraq. In fact, Afghanistan (nor Muslims in general) was not responsible for what had happened. It was the result of one extreme religious group in particular - not every Muslim nation. Not every Iraqi is a terrorist; to think so is completely ignorant. So what exactly does 9/11 have to do with the war in Iraq? If you're claim is that the Iraqi regime has helped to fund terrorism, then obviously my rebuttal would be SO HAVE WE. It is common knowledge by now that the United States has helped supply Osama bin Laden himself with weapons, money and technology to help fight wars in the Middle East. So we are just as guilty ~ what's your point? You've mentioned that the media only portrays the bad things happening in Iraq and fails to show servicemen providing aid and supplies to the Iraqi people. My argument is that we don't need a war to provide relief to people in need. You concluded with the fact that your biggest gripe is not with people who disagree with the war specifically, but with people who do not support the troops. My statement back to you is that perhaps people DO in fact support the troops, and that's why they want them back home instead of off to die unnecessarily. People can support the fact that American soldiers are over in Iraq doing the job that their superiors have assigned unto them. However, supporting the troops while they do their best to survive their noble career is much different than agreeing that America should be involved in a war that is catastrophically expensive and detrimental to the economy, alienates our allies, and puts our soldiers at risk. Plus, how can you expect the American people to trust the government after we were lied to repeatedly about the imaginary WMDs? Bottom line: There are both pros and cons to the war in Iraq, but the cons far outweigh the good. And being against the war is completely different than being against the troops.",1,Danielle,"

Since I am not afforded the luxury of Microsoft when I am at work, it is an issue that I work with. I would like to point out the irony of you calling me out with grammar errors though when you seem prone to post sentence fragments. ""Cons most than pros unfortunately"". Even if I could guess what you were trying to say, it seems you forgot a subject and a verb. I do admit auto correct kills me, but at least I am witty enough to make a sentence look pretty. I will now break down my opponents main points again. (1) Drone strikes again, since he seems fixated on this. (2) Education (3) Healthcare (1) Since he mixes points on this first paragraph I will try to offer a rebuttal based off of what he was saying. He says ""Also, he cut health benefits for soldiers and makes them pay slightly more for medical service. Of course, this affects warfare which affects drone strikes."" Lets assume this is accurate for the sake of this debate. He is saying because Obama cut health benefits from soldiers, it will ultimately cause a drone strike. I am seriously hoping whoever is reading this can do basic math. Lets break this town. When you say because health care was cut(if this was true) from soldiers, we could logically assume it would affect a lot of different things. It would affect their families, it would affect the quality of work, it would affect their salaries. An argument like this could be considered a 1+1=2 argument. This is not the case though. He states because healthcare is supposedly cut from soldiers, It will somehow cause drone strikes. This is not a 1+1=2 argument it is a 1+1=3, actually its more like a 1+1=9. It is fine to play connect the dots, but you have to have all the dots in between. He merely says this, and offers a link showing how Pakistan responds to drone strikes. I will repeat what I said in my prior argument, it is impossible to debate this due to the type of information we would have to have. We would need to know the nature of why they are bombing certain groups of terrorists. I am actually quite happy they are bombing some of them, and I would imagine most people who do not want attacks to come on American soil are too. I think the most illogical part of his entire argument is this ""they happen in the Middle East and sometimes US citizens are put down by the government"". I think the stupidity of this statement speaks for itself. He is saying that our government is bombing terrorist while killing our citizens whom happen to be over there. Unless he is referring to us randomly bombing places, and accident killing reporters or missionaries, I have no idea how to even combat this golden piece of information. As i previously stated the absurdity of this remark is evident. (2) As for education I have shown links above to show what they are planning to do. Obama wants to make it easier for people with disabilities and that are poor to be able to go to college. I do not see why this is a problem. It is making people who can actually afford it pay to get in, and offered up pell grants and different types of loans to children who would not normally be able to afford it. The one thing I am sure that everybody knows is that it is an economic necessity for children to be able to educate themselves. He has not addressed this nor even bothered to bring it up or refute it. He merely states that they are cutting $89,000,000 dollars from education funding. I have always addressed this point in my previous argument so I will not both to repeat it again. (3) Again I have no idea how to even refute this. He merely blames Obama care for single handily causing our nations debt crisis. Once again the absurdity of this remark speaks for itself. We have been in an economic down turn long before Obama got into office. We have dubya to think for that. He also still has not addressed how Obama care would help people with pre exisitng medical conditions and terminal illness. I have shown above where they could not be turned down. He then proceeds to rant on about immigration and restates the point he made earlier without even addressing my rebuttal to it. In closing Con has not addressed 95 percent of the points I offered in rebuttals. He has not addressed any of my ideology stances in the first round. He has fought this whole entire debate with personal opinions hidden behind a wall of assumptions. I have shown you the ideology behind some of Obama's policies along with refuting all of pros claims, and have even explained the practicality of some of the current policies that are in place. While he has shown us his opinion, and provided some reasons to why he believes it, he has yet to combat any one of points that I provided. I think there is no question that Obama's policies have good ideology behind them as I have demonstrated all throughout this debate. I think we can even go as far as to say, that some of his policies that he has in place now have our best interest at heart. All throughout this debate I have shown that while they may not be perfect, the ideology behind his policies have the possibility to benefit our nation and some are doing just that. Con has not answered any of my questions so I think we can conclude that all of my points are valid and stand as is. Thank you for taking the time to read this debate.",1,Mikal,"

Obama wants to make it easier for people with disabilities and that are poor to be able to go to college. I do not see why this is a problem. It is making people who can actually afford it pay to get in, and offered up pell grants and different types of loans to children who would not normally be able to afford it. The one thing I am sure that everybody knows is that it is an economic necessity for children to be able to educate themselves. He has not addressed this nor even bothered to bring it up or refute it. He merely states that they are cutting $89,000,000 dollars from education funding. I have always addressed this point in my previous argument so I will not both to repeat it again.   (3)  Again I have no idea how to even refute this. He merely blames Obama care for single handily causing our nations debt crisis. Once again the absurdity of this remark speaks for itself. We have been in an economic down turn long before Obama got into office. We have dubya to think for that. He also still has not addressed how Obama care would help people with pre exisitng medical conditions and terminal illness. I have shown above where they could not be turned down. He then proceeds to rant on about immigration and restates the point he made earlier without even addressing my rebuttal to it.   In closing  Con has not addressed 95 percent of the points I offered in rebuttals. He has not addressed any of my ideology stances in the first round. He has fought this whole entire debate with personal opinions hidden behind a wall of assumptions. I have shown you the ideology behind some of Obama's policies along with refuting all of pros claims, and have even explained the practicality  of some of the current policies that are in place. While he has shown us his opinion, and provided some reasons to why he believes it, he has yet to combat any one of points that I provided. I think there is no question that Obama's policies have good ideology behind them as I have demonstrated all throughout this debate. I think we can even go as far as to say, that some of his policies that he has in place now have our best interest at heart.   All throughout this debate I have shown that while they may not be perfect, the ideology behind his policies have the possibility to benefit our nation and some are doing just that. Con has not answered any of my questions so I think we can conclude that all of my points are valid and stand as is. Thank you for taking the time to read this debate.

85,"Thanks to my opponent for instigating this debate. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve some of the main issues that got somewhat obscured in the previous debate we did on gay marriage. Our goal in this debate is to decide whether marriage should exist as a legal institution, not to argue over the legal merits of specific types of marriages. ::Case Pro- Rebuttals:: Contention 1: The legalization of marriage violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Mongeese rightfully observes that our legal system is set up in such a way so that single people are treated differently than married people. However, the conclusions he draws from this fact seem wholly unsubstantiated. Married people have reached a status in society that justifies their special treatment. They simply have many more responsibilities than most single people. Given this fact, it is unreasonable and legally preposterous to argue that treating married and non-married people differently violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. One of my main purposes in this debate will be to show that a legal distinction between married and non-married people is justifiable. ::Case Pro:: Contention 1: Discrimination between married and single people is justified. The dichotomy of legal treatment between those who are married and those who aren't is warranted. Married people take on extra responsibilities that are not undertaken by single people. For instance, they often raise families, which requires quite a bit of time, effort, and money. People that get married have lots of responsibilities, and thus, it is not unreasonable that they should be rewarded for this in a way that single people aren't. Furthermore, if single people want to receive the benefits that married people receive all they have to do is get married. Marriage itself is not an inherently segregated or discriminatory institution. Anyone can get married whether they are rich or poor; educated or uneducated; white or black; or completely incompetent. There is nothing stopping people from getting married. Every legal resident of the United States, except gays, is on a level playing field in terms of their ability to be married. Therefore, single people do little more than gripe when they argue that married people receive legal benefits that they don't. Contention 2: Legally sanctioned marriages are good for couples. As the DDO member andre points out in one of his debates, marriage has many useful functions that are intrinsically valuable to a couple. [1] Among other things these benefits include: - Inheritance of property - Rights to make a medical decision for a spouse, or making other decision such as funeral arrangements - Joint tax filing and joint adoption - Rights to non-resident or alien partners - Marital confidence privilege and spousal testimonial privilege - Parenting rights (access or rights of both partners to make decisions for their child) - Custody of children - Shared property and shared bank accounts It is, of course, true that these benefits could be achieved through various other methods without the legal sanctioning of marriage. However, what would be the point of reworking a system that doesn't appear to be broken? Legally sanctioned marriages provide all these benefits in one easy step. [2] If each of these rights had to be acquired individually or in groups the entire process of ""marriage"" would become needlessly convoluted. Contention 3: Marriage is good for society and should be promoted by the government. Marriage helps provide a safe place to have children and raise a family. And the importance of this institution really cannot be overrated. In fact, many aspects of societal dysfunction can be positively correlated with broken homes or otherwise dysfunctional families. [3] [4] Indeed, there is hardly another factor more foretelling of a persons status latter in life than the condition of the family they were raised in. Therefore, if a government wants to increase the well being of the nation that it's ruling it would be a good idea to promote marriage by subsidizing it with financial incentives and other benefits. This helps encourage couples to get married and in a small way helps improve marriages by making them financially less strenuous for people. Contention 4: Laws or legal arrangements that produce maximal utility should be preferred in a society. According to the philosopher Jeremy Bentham actions can be said to be good or bad depending on the consequences they produce. And among his many contributions to philosophy was his development of the hedonic calculus. [5] [6] To put this principle in simplistic terms it basically states that any action can be considered good depending on how much pleasure it produces when the well being of all of those affected is taken into consideration. Given this understanding of ethics, it is then easy to realize that legally sanctioned marriages are valuable because they produce many positive benefits in society for lots of people. Legally sanctioned marriages are key aspects of a healthy and functional society. Conversely, there is no reason to think that society would be any better off if my opponent's views were taken to their logical conclusion and we abolished marriage. Eradicating marriage as a legal institution would simply be a risky venture with no discernable benefits. And unless my opponent can demonstrate that abolishing marriage is good for society then he doesn't really have a very strong case. Hopefully, that should be enough for now. I look forward to your response. ---References--- 1. <URL>... See Con: Round 1 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>... 5. <URL>... 6. <URL>...",1,Freeman,"

They sought a law suit against NAMBLA for teaching and encouraging these men to commit the heinous act they did. Guess who came swiftly to the defense of NAMBLA? The ACLU. And they won!

89,"I will be arguing that creationism has no place in public education. It is a profoundly unscientific approach to the origin and diversity of life and the available data and evidence fit much better with the theory of evolution than with creationism. In addition, creationism violates what's known as the establishment clause of the U.S. constitution. These are the three pillars of contention that I shall be building my case around. 1. Creationism isn't scientific 2. Evolution better explains the evidence 3. Creationism is unconstitutional Let's look at point one first of all. Creationism is unscientific for a variety of reasons, it's not falsifiable, it doesn't make any testable predictions, there is no evidence to support it and plenty of evidence against it, in addition to it blunting Occam's razor by grafting on the premise that life needs a designer when we have a perfectly suitable naturalistic explaination for the diversity and complexity of life in the form of evolution (more on that later). As a result, creationism has been widely rejected by the scientific community. A Gallup poll taken in 1991 showed that of the 480,000 scientists in the U.S., only 5% were creationists. That number however takes in to account engineers and scientists not working in fields relevant to the creation/evolution debate. When only taking in to account scientists working in relevant fields, that figure drop to less that 0.15%, and that's in America, the country with more so called ""creation scientists"" that anywhere else in the developed world. Creationism is unscientific simply because it does not follow the scientific method. A scientific theory begins with an observation, leads to a hypothesis to try and explain the observation, makes testable predictions, constantly compares those predictions against new evidence, then experiments are done to test it's veracity even further, experiments that must be reproducable and replicated to ensure that the theory really is the best, most complete explanation of the way a facet of the world works that we can offer, and when a better theory comes along, the original theory is either discarded or ammended.Creationism begins with the hypothesis and looks for observations to support it. Creationism offers no testable predictions or experiment by which we might test it. Creationism offers nothing that could falsify it, and now we most definitely have a better theory in evolution by natural selection, a theory that provides a powerful explanatory mechanism that creationism doesn't, it makes testable predictions, and the many observations and experiments supporting it are reproducable. Evolution is a scientific theory, creationism doesn't rise above the level of hypothesis at the very best, and pseudoscience at worst. So let's look at evolution. Evolution is one of the most watertight, widely supported, rigourous theories in science, standing proudly alongside relativity, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. It's supported by molecular biology, it's supported by the fossil record, including transitional fossils that creationists endlessly claim don't exist, and it's independantly supported and verified by other fields of science, including medicine, many treatments of which, such as vaccines, have to take evolutionary principles in to account, in the case of flu vaccines, the disease that the vaccine has been designed to combat evolves, which is why new vaccines need to be brought out each year to combat the new strain. The level of support evolution enjoys from the scientific community is almost unanimus, many members of which, are Christians, or religious in general. I'll elaborate further on the evidence for evolution in my rebuttals as it will no doubt be challlenged (and rightly so, this is a debate after all) but for now I want to examine the legal argument. The establishment clause is a clause found in the first amendment of the U.S. constitution that states, verbatim: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"". This ensures that the United States cannot ratify a state church or state religion and ensures that religion and state are kept separate from each other, in other words, a religion, any religion, can't dictate the running of the state. Creationism is a religious viewpoint, even if you attempt to dress it up as merely a biological hypothesis, it's a hypothesis based solely on one's religious opinion, it has to be, because as I demonstrated earlier, the scientific method does not lead to the conclusion that there is a designer because such a theory is unscientific in a variety of ways. As further evidence of this, I call to your attention the very highly publicised legal trial of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area High School. This was a result of a recent decision of the school board voting to challenge evolution and ""teach the (so called) controversy"". The court found that intelligent design (which is just creationism in disguise, something else the court found) was a primarily religious initiative that unnecessarily and unconstitutionally entangled church and state, failing what has become known as the lemon test. It also found that intelligent design was not science. The lemon test examines three points. Is the action purely secular? Does it promote or inhibit religion? Does it entangle church and state? A failure of any of these conditions means the action is unconstitutional under the establishment clause. Intelligent design fails all three.

103,"As a brief roadmap of my argument for this round, I will be proving that Socialism upholds the first three ideals of Democracy more effectively than Capitalism. I will also be providing a block against my opponent's first proposed point. Contention 1: The economic and social policies of Socialism allow the majority to rule rather than a wealthy minority. As my opponent earlier stated in his definitions, Socialism is distinct from capitalism because it provides equal benefits regardless of work completed. In a Socialist economy, no individual can rise significantly above another, while in a Capitalist system, both vertical and horizontal motion are possible in terms of socioeconomic status. In Capitalist systems, interest groups, often headed by the economic elite, often seek to shape public policy by ""donating"" or funding campaigns for office. In fact, the vast majority of elections are funded primarily by such interest groups. An overabundance of examples from American campaigns can be found at <URL>... . When these interest groups donate money and influence policy makers, they are not representing the majority of citizens. They are representing small groups of citizens, and the policies created often favor a wealthy minority over the majority population. Examples of this are abundant not only in the American government, but in capitalist or capitalist-leaning systems worldwide. A Socialist government, meanwhile, offers much less room for individuals to dominate the economy. Rather, in order to donate significant funds to political campaigns, a multitude of individuals would logically have to pool resources. Thus, any significant contributions by individuals to a political campaigns in a Socialist economic system would reflect a greater number of citizens, rather than a wealthy minority. In this case, majority does rule. Contention 2: The economic and social policies of Socialism protect and ensure minority rights more effectively than the economic and social policies of Capitalism. In many Democratic Capitalist nations, minorities are underrepresented in the Legislative branch of government. The Legislative branch is responsible for the creation and passing of new laws. When minorities are underrepresented in this governmental branch, policies that benefit and protect their rights are pursued less than necessary. For equality to exist in a Democracy, the rights and equality of minorities to the majority must be actively protected. The under representation of minorities in the Legislative branch, and therefore in government as a whole, is reflected by their economic and social conditions. For example, in America from the late twentieth century until now, the rate at which the number of impoverished African Americans is double that of the national rate of increase. The majority of Americans are caucasian, and thus the ""average rate"" primarily represents them. The rapidly rising number of impoverished African Americans effectively parallels their representation in congress; African Americans hold less than 10% of the seats in America's legislative branch. Perhaps one of the most significant recent examples of infringement on minority rights caused by the under representation of minorities in the Legislative branch is America's infamous Senate Bill 1070. A document originally proposed by Arizona and passed by the American senate, SB 1070 enabled police officers to pull over drivers and make ""reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of the person"" in the case of ""reasonable suspicion."" The law essentially legalized racial profiling for Arizona state police, infringing majorly on the rights of Latino Americans. Latino Americans are another minority group underrepresented in Congress. They, on average, also have a much lower per capita income than the American majority, and more often live in poverty. The relationship between these factors in undeniable. Argument Block: Equality is an inherent part of Democratic ideals. Equity does not suffice in a true Democracy. The use of equality in Democracy is parallel with the belief in Egalitarianism. Egalitarianism is the belief that all people ought to be treated equally in a society. Equity, meanwhile, would be referring to ""Equity theory,"" or the perceptions of fair or unfair distributions of resources within interpersonal relationships, which in this case are relationships among the citizens in a country. Equity theory would try to create as ""fair"" a distribution as possible. The idea is inherently flawed. While Egalitarianism is simple and absolute in concept, being the equal social and economic treatment of all by government, equity theory is debatable. The definition of equality is not subject to interpretation: it is the state of being equal. Fairness, meanwhile, is a very flexible term. Many people have different interpretations of what would be fair and what wouldn't. In the case of a ""Democracy"" based on equity alone (although such a thing would never be a true Democracy), one could take members of society who were more intelligent, more athletic, or more talented and treat these people at a different level than individuals who were less so. It could be considered ""fair"" to treat one who is ""better"" better. On the other hand, people with mental or physical disabilities should be treated differently, as well. It is only fair to the rest of society and to those people if the government spends less on them and cares less for them. The definition of equity and fairness is too broad and too malleable to be used in a Democracy. It can be easily warped to create a government under which not all citizens are represented, minority rights are not protected, and private interests dominate the political and social mechanisms of the country. I look forward to my opponent's arguments and rebuttals.",1,Public_Agenda,"

In the case of a ""Democracy"" based on equity alone (although such a thing would never be a true Democracy), one could take members of society who were more intelligent, more athletic, or more talented and treat these people at a different level than individuals who were less so. It could be considered ""fair"" to treat one who is ""better"" better. On the other hand, people with mental or physical disabilities should be treated differently, as well. It is only fair to the rest of society and to those people if the government spends less on them and cares less for them.  
  
The definition of equity and fairness is too broad and too malleable to be used in a Democracy. It can be easily warped to create a government under which not all citizens are represented, minority rights are not protected, and private interests dominate the political and social mechanisms of the country.

105,"Here is my final argument. Thank you for this amazing debate! Rebuttal #1: Communism and Socialism are separate and incomparable. While Russia and China may qualify as being Socialist, their actions against minority groups and generally inhumane policies were not policies of Socialism; they were policies of Communism. Socialism is an economic and social system. Communism is Socialism, but with a fascist or police state dictatorship for a political system. It was the dictatorial political system that enacts policies these inhumane or unrepresentative policies, not the Socialist economic and social system. Rebuttal #2: Political and economic systems are separate and do not necessarily go hand in hand. I brought up the under representation of minorities not as a direct political effect or policy of Capitalism, but rather as an indirect effect caused by the economic policies of Capitalism, thus making it still legitimate in the context of the topic. Pure political policies are not legitimate for this topic. An economic system does need a political system to back it, yes, but the variance in political and economic systems is so massive that you can not necessarily say that all Bureaucracies are Capitalist, for example. The only exceptions would be Fascism and Communism, since both imply an economy owned and run by the government. However, no other political systems imply a particular economic system. A few examples . . . Capitalist Monarchies, Capitalist or Socialist Confederations, Capitalist Oligarchies, Capitalist and Socialist Republics . . . The list continues on, as shown by ( <URL>... ). Rebuttal #3: Socialism does give political bargaining power. A Democracy is meant to have majority rule. If minorities had the individual political bargaining power to make significant differences, majority rule would become void. Using my opponent's own analogy, blue collar workers do not have any connection or control to their bosses . . . In a Capitalist system. Under Socialism, where workers' rights and regulation are general policies, workers can strike or petition without fear and can influence their boss's decisions. Similarly, groups of citizens can come together to petition, or can withhold their vote. Thus, citizens still have political bargaining power, but it is vested in groups rather than individuals. Rebuttal #4: Socialism does not distribute wealth arbitrarily. Because wealth is distributed in regard to the current economic status of the nation in question, Socialism does not arbitrarily distribute wealth. Wealth is distributed equally and in regard to several factors, namely the government and economy. This is clearly not arbitrary. Rebuttal #5: Equality is necessary for Democracy, not equity. As I am short on space, I would like to remind my opponent that I proved that equality is an integral part of Democracy, and that equity does not suffice. To review my argument, please reread my argument block from Round 2. Contention #3: Socialism guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to citizens protected under a government more effectively than Capitalism. Life - When deprived of economic means by which to support himself, a citizen is being deprived of life. The greatest priority of a Democratic government is to ensure life to its citizens. In a Capitalist system where economy is driven by work done and is a competitive environment where not everyone is guaranteed a job, not everyone will have a means by which to support himself. If a citizen can not support himself, there must be a welfare program to ensure that he does not die of starvation or cold or some other similar harm. Any such welfare program would be social spending, an aspect of Socialism, not Capitalism. Liberty - Liberty is giving each and every citizen equal opportunity and treatment. In the case that one citizen can rise to a level of economic power and infringe upon the rights of another citizen, and do so legally at that, is a clear demonstration of how Capitalism fails to protect the Democratic right of a citizen to liberty. Socialism ensures the equal treatment of citizens and limits vertical socioeconomic movement, preventing such infringement upon the rights of others. The Pursuit of Happiness - How can a person pursue happiness if they cannot even afford to eat? Once again, one person taking from the economy for his own happiness but denying happiness to others is not Democracy. My opponent will probably argue that by limiting a person's ability to achieve wealth, you limit his or her ability to be happy. But this is not true. Numerous studies done by Princeton and Yale have found that once a person makes enough money to pay the bills, excess money does not make a person happier. In fact, suicide rates seem to increase with income. One such study can be found at ( <URL>... ). As this is the final round, I will conclude my arguments. Over the last few rounds, I have proven that the economic and social policies of Socialism more effectively uphold the five defined aspects of Democracy than the economic and social policies of Capitalism. They do this primarily through the regulation of economy, the equal treatment of citizens, the guarantee of life and safety through welfare programs, and preventing private interests from dominating government and politics. I have proven that equality is an integral aspect of Democracy, and that equity does not suffice. My opponent has provided rebuttals that rely on invalid comparisons and arguments that do not follow the topic.

Military Conscription is a term of art, as implied by the resolution, therefore we ought to look my definition as it is the most topical and provides more clash. One must also observe that term ""Military Conscription"", by definition, is not specific to the United States. Unjust shall be defined as lacking the qualities of justice. Justice shall be defined as the quality of being just. and Just shall be defined as guided by truth and reason in accordance with standards or requirements; proper or right. All of the above definitions can be found in <URL>... , with the exception of military conscription. Because the resolution asks us the determine whether or not an action is just and because the only way we can determine this is by the effect an action has on society, justice and societal welfare are the most applicable values for the round. My opponent does not offer a value, therefore you ought to accept these. Since, the value of societal welfare insinuates that we ought to look to the ends of an action, the concept of utilitarianism is the most applicable values justification or value criterion. Hence, the value criterion will be ""adherence to utilitarian principles"". I shall only offer a mini-case, because my main intention is to dismiss my opponent's case in it's entirety, so that you can default the negative position. _____________________________________________ Negative Case: V: Justice and Societal Welfare VC: Adherence to utilitarian principles Contention: Military Conscription provides safety Because Military Conscription only occurs in the most desperate of cases, the intention of it is solely to protect it's citizens. This is a maneuver used to preserve the nation's sovereignty, this is shown by the very definition of ""Military Conscription"" because the conscription phase would only occur whenever the government needs it most. As proven in the past, ""drafts"" only occur as means of self-defense and are typically successful, thus, the end result of military conscription is protection, though a few may die or get injured, that is not enough to deem it as unjust. This links back to the values because it is the proper and just action for the government to preserve itself, this is also consistant with societal welfare because it would protect society. The majority of the civilians would be protected through this action, thus it is consistent with utilitarian principles of, ""the greatest good, for the greatest number."" ______________________________________________ My opponent believes that the primary grounds for affirmation is that Military Conscription is inconsistent with U.S. principles, he quotes the U.S. declaration of independence as well as recognizing our individual unalienable rights offered to us by our founding fathers. He articulates the very notion that our founding father's would disagree with the act of military conscription. This is a summary of 5 out of 7 paragraphs in my opponent case, therefore he intentionally, or unintentionally, makes this founding fathers argument the most important issue for this debate. I contend that very analysis. Though the founding fathers are respectable figures here in America, they are not the arbitors of what is or is not just, both here in the US and internationally. The resolution ought to be taken as an internationally, one that applies to all, not just the United States, but the rest of the world as well. My opponent has established his own burden, now, he must prove to you that the US founding fathers are of such international influence that they, this group of all-white, primarily British old men, represent the ideas of the people internationally. The second burden that my opponent has is to prove that these men have the capacity to be the arbiters of what is or is not just, in that such a notion is utterly absurd, essentially, my opponent has lost the debate already, through his own words. I ask you to recall the terminology of the resolution, in that it does not specify a nation, we must refer to military conscription in principle, and not specific to any location. This is enough to dismiss my opponent's case, as he is not proving anything in his case until he establishes the fact that our founding fathers speak on behalf of the present-day international community. ______________________________________________ My opponent then offers another reason to affirm, his reason is that the minorities and the poor will suffer. He states that since the wealthy and well-connected have the capability to allow there children ""escape the horrors of war"", the minorities and poor will suffer.

Also, look to South Africa, the Afrikaners are a minority population in South Africa, yet, they are primarily wealthy and extremely powerful. SECOND: I would argue that, this doesn't necessarily mean the minorities and poor would suffer, rather, if we look at it in a different, more logical light, the few rich and very well-connected would ""dodge the draft"", my opponent has yet to prove that because some, extremely few, wealthy people can ""dodge the draft"", Military Conscription is unjust.

Neither women nor men are discriminated against in the case of restrooms: Facilities are provided for each, and they have equal opportunity to relieve themselves. Even IF restrooms were a case of discrimination, it would not mean that all other discrimination were negated! Civil rights are not moot because toilets are segregated by gender. My opponent has a ridiculous and unfortunate view of civil rights, which I can only hope to correct. To have a child is not a criminal act, although my confused opponent compares it to one. Since my opponent claims the issue is ""readiness"", whether the POTUS is voluntarily incapacitated or not is irrelevant. All that matters is the outcome, not the intention. So, the resolution is unworkable: If pregnancy, then other issues that could incapacitate a President. You could just as well argue that a POTUS with a history of heart disease in his family is endangering national security. Or a candidate that is particularly old. The selection of a President could become highly discriminatory. Also, you cannot deny an unsterilized woman the office of POTUS on a hypothetical . Hypothetically, a male POTUS may get testicular cancer. Should we then pre-empt the possibility by insisting only on eunuchs in the White House? The electorate has a right to choose the candidate they see fit, and are fully capable of assessing the capabilities and readiness of a woman of childbearing age for office. In the unlikely event that a female POTUS actually does get pregnant and and wishes to be the primary care giver, ie raise children, then resignation is a less drastic option than sterilization. I think I should get the conduct points for this debate because my opponent actually goes as far as to quote mine me on this! Another option is that the Vice President could do the job the Vice President is designated to do and manage the ship while the mother is convalescing. The battle to make employment truly meritocratic, through civil rights, is an ongoing one and has been long and hard fought. To affirm the resolution would be to take a backwards step.

  I do not agree that this is a controversial issue. I thank opponent for his efforts.  I will close with a summary of my case.  The law forbids discrimination on basis of sex.  The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 clearly makes it illegal to discriminate ""on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.""  My opponent would have this legislation reversed, for the sole purpose of allowing sterilization of the POTUS. The highest office in America sets an example.

I do not think this is an appropriate stance to take, and I will give an analogy that hopefully will prove helpful: I believe the use of currency is a more effective method for business (commerce). In current day Zimbabwe the inflation rate is about 300% and therefore currency is useless (without value). Therefore, the use of currency is not a more effective method for business. There could be many confounding variables that lead to the social and economical problems seen in Russia today (and of course in the past). There are many problems in non-communist countries today, does this mean we should abandon those systems and accept communism?

119,"Yes. I'm passionately opposed to intervening in Syria. **As a disclaimer, I will use my exact arguments from my other debate for my first entry, as I spent a good amount of time crafting them, and my other opponent forfeited.** As for your claim that Assad's troops fired on U.N inspectors, I would appreciate it if you would cite a source. I cannot find anything to evidence that, and this is the first I am hearing about it. No offense but I seriously doubt that statement is accurate. The reasons why we should stay out of Syria are numerous. ----Syrian Rebels (FSA)----- Arming/Supporting the rebels is dangerous ground to say the least. It has been reported that the rebel faction is affiliated with militant Islamic Extremists, not people that we want to arm. We already made that mistake when we armed militants in Afghanistan so they could fight the Russians. Then they fought us. <URL>... ... There are multiple allegations of war crimes, civilian kidnappings, murders thefts from Turkish merchants, prisoner executions, body mutilation and torture committed by the FSA. Much of this has been confirmed by HRW (Human Rights Watch) <URL>... ... So do we have any sort of confidence that FSA(Free Syrian Army) will provide a regime superior to the current one? And who is the U.S to choose one Human Rights abuser over another? The FSA is NOT a credible force worthy of American support. -----Iran and Russia------ This entire situation is reminiscent of the Cold War, although it isn't as blatant as the proxy wars between the U.S.S.R, and America, the correlation exists. Iran openly supplies and backs the Assad regime, and have recently deployed 4,000 soldiers to support the Assad Regime. It is not in American interests to increase tensions with a budding nuclear power that is already at odds with the west. <URL>... ... Putin and Obama are now butting heads again thanks to Syria. Russia has come out in support of the Assad regime and has supplied them in the past, and now opposes intervention . Russia is locking out the Security Council and blocking the U.S""s request for the use of force in Syria. The use of force in Syria would be a breach of international law and protocol. I find it ironic that America breaks international law and protocol in order to enforce it. <URL>... ... Breaching international law does nothing but devalue the U.N and proliferate the colloquial idea of America as World Police. Straining already tense international relations is not something that we need either. Much of the world opposes military intervention, including a very large part of the American population. ----Post Conflict----- If America intervenes in the Syrian conflict, we are partly culpable for whatever the outcome may be. If the Assad regime is overthrown, Syria is presented with the monumental task of state building. Although the FSA proclaims it has ideals of equality and democracy at heart, there is no guarantee that the following regime will be any different. The same cycle of liberator to dictator to civil war has been happening in Africa for decades. If America intervenes, we assume some responsibility for the product of our intervention, we cannot(shouldn""t) simply hit and run. Peace-building and state-building are some of the most complex and difficult processes in the political spectrum. Are we really ready to assume another one of those responsibilities? Especially after seeing how miserably unsuccessful our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been. I don""t believe that our incursions into those communities have bettered those countries. I don""t think many people do. A Syrian intervention would produce a very similar situation, likely much worse. How do we now that the instigation of liberal state building would be beneficial or even realistically possible in Syria? The placement of liberal institutions in Iraq/Afghanistan has been largely unsuccessful. ----Conclusion---- In the last 10 years, America has already gone through grueling, and largely unsuccessful democratization efforts. We do not need the financial responsibility of upholding a mock democracy while being forced to rule a post-conflict society with martial law. Why here? Why now? Genocide, murder and other mass human rights violations have been and are taking place in Somalia, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mali, and Korea, many of which are comparable or worse than the Syrian Civil war. Where is the standard for Intervention? How can we justify saving Syrians over Kenyans? How can we afford another war? The national deficit is still skyrocketing. Does being world police supersede our duties to our own country? Finally, being the pacifist that I am, I believe that violence begets violence. The use of force to pacify a nation has many secondary and tertiary consequences. I will leave you with the words of our own President, Barack Obama.

**As a disclaimer, I will use my exact arguments from my other debate for my first entry, as I spent a good amount of time crafting them, and my other opponent forfeited.**  
  
As for your claim that Assad's troops fired on U.N inspectors, I would appreciate it if you would cite a source. I cannot find anything to evidence that, and this is the first I am hearing about it. No offense but I seriously doubt that statement is accurate.  
  
The reasons why we should stay out of Syria are numerous.  
  
----Syrian Rebels (FSA)-----  
Arming/Supporting the rebels is dangerous ground to say the least. It has been reported that the rebel faction is affiliated with militant Islamic Extremists, not people that we want to arm. We already made that mistake when we armed militants in Afghanistan so they could fight the Russians. Then they fought us.  
  
  http://www.cbsnews.com...  ...  
  
There are multiple allegations of war crimes, civilian kidnappings, murders thefts from Turkish merchants, prisoner executions, body mutilation and torture committed by the FSA. Much of this has been confirmed by HRW (Human Rights Watch)  
  
  http://www.hrw.org...  ...  
  
So do we have any sort of confidence that FSA(Free Syrian Army) will provide a regime superior to the current one? And who is the U.S to choose one Human Rights abuser over another?  
  
The FSA is NOT a credible force worthy of American support.  
  
-----Iran and Russia------  
This entire situation is reminiscent of the Cold War, although it isn't as blatant as the proxy wars between the U.S.S.R, and America, the correlation exists. Iran openly supplies and backs the Assad regime, and have recently deployed 4,000 soldiers to support the Assad Regime. It is not in American interests to increase tensions with a budding nuclear power that is already at odds with the west.  
  
  http://www.independent.co.uk...  ...  
  
Putin and Obama are now butting heads again thanks to Syria. Russia has come out in support of the Assad regime and has supplied them in the past, and now opposes intervention . Russia is locking out the Security Council and blocking the U.S""s request for the use of force in Syria. The use of force in Syria would be a breach of international law and protocol. I find it ironic that America breaks international law and protocol in order to enforce it.  
  
  http://www.slate.com...  ...  
  
Breaching international law does nothing but devalue the U.N and proliferate the colloquial idea of America as World Police. Straining already tense international relations is not something that we need either. Much of the world opposes military intervention, including a very large part of the American population.  
  
----Post Conflict-----  
If America intervenes in the Syrian conflict, we are partly culpable for whatever the outcome may be. If the Assad regime is overthrown, Syria is presented with the monumental task of state building. Although the FSA proclaims it has ideals of equality and democracy at heart, there is no guarantee that the following regime will be any different. The same cycle of liberator to dictator to civil war has been happening in Africa for decades. If America intervenes, we assume some responsibility for the product of our intervention, we cannot(shouldn""t) simply hit and run.  
  
Peace-building and state-building are some of the most complex and difficult processes in the political spectrum. Are we really ready to assume another one of those responsibilities? Especially after seeing how miserably unsuccessful our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been. I don""t believe that our incursions into those communities have bettered those countries. I don""t think many people do. A Syrian intervention would produce a very similar situation, likely much worse. How do we now that the instigation of liberal state building would be beneficial or even realistically possible in Syria? The placement of liberal institutions in Iraq/Afghanistan has been largely unsuccessful.  
  
----Conclusion----  
In the last 10 years, America has already gone through grueling, and largely unsuccessful democratization efforts. We do not need the financial responsibility of upholding a mock democracy while being forced to rule a post-conflict society with martial law.  
  
Why here? Why now? Genocide, murder and other mass human rights violations have been and are taking place in Somalia, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mali, and Korea, many of which are comparable or worse than the Syrian Civil war. Where is the standard for Intervention? How can we justify saving Syrians over Kenyans?  
  
How can we afford another war? The national deficit is still skyrocketing. Does being world police supersede our duties to our own country?  
  
Finally, being the pacifist that I am, I believe that violence begets violence. The use of force to pacify a nation has many secondary and tertiary consequences.  
  
I will leave you with the words of our own President, Barack Obama.

120,"I would also like to thank Zach for accepting my debate! My opponent states that 800 Palestinians have been killed in this battle while only 8 Israelis have been killed. I fail to see how this means that Israel's invasion is unjustified, especially since most of the Palestinians that were killed were members of the terrorist organization known as Hamas. Throughout the history of this conflict, Israel has done its utmost to limit the number of civilian deaths while the terrorists have done their utmost to maximize civilian deaths on both sides. My opponent claims that Israel violated the ceasefire 185 times, which is false. I would like to know where he is getting this information. The ceasefire was broken by Hamas, who continued to launch rockets into Israel in order to kill civilians. Throughout this conflict, we have seen Israel get attacked by terrorist groups only to find that they are condemned whenever they retaliate. Israel is the ONLY nation on this earth that is expected to not defend itself when attacked. Even countries that have acted the same way in similar situations have criticized Israel ie. Turkey. Israel cannot be expected to have rockets launched into its territory every day and take it with a smile. My opponents assertion that Israel doesn't have the right to do anything in the Middle East just because it is not a Muslim country is absurd. EVERY country has the right to defend itself regardless of what their religion is. The statement that Israel would be gone if it weren't for the US is an ignorant statement. Israel was able to defend itself in 1948, 1967, 1973, and against attacks in between without the help of the US. The Arab states that have attacked Israel were given aid by Russia just like we give Israel aid. My opponent claims that Hamas launches rockets because of Israel's blockade, which is another ignorant argument. If the Palestinians would renounce terrorism and give up violence, they wouldn't have to worry about blockades. Even so, the goal of Hamas is not to get Israel to lift the blockade. Hamas' goal is to destroy Israel and replace it with a Muslim state, so the blockade has nothing to do with Hamas' agenda. The history of this conflict shows that it is the Islamic Terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad that keep the violence going. If they would renounce violence, then there would be peace. Israel is perfectly justified in defending itself just as any other country would be.",1,Watchman81,"

Worker cooperatives collectively own and control the means of production. Hence the system which I described fits within this definition. There are other parts of this definition which must be jettisoned if we want to talk about socialism in the traditional sense of the word.

The U.S.S.R. should have been called the Empire of Statist Dictatorships. You see, during the Russian Revolution in 1917, there was, at first, a potential for the development of true socialism. Worker's Councils were enabling Russian workers to democratically own and control the means of production. As I pointed out in round 1, worker ownership and control of the means of production is what socialists have traditionally advocated. However, by 1921, Lenin dismantled the worker's councils. Lenin himself said that Russia was not ready for socialism. The Bolshevik Party would keep the country ready for socialism, waiting until revolutions in more advanced societies. The Soviet model was not socialist since it didn't have worker's control of the means of production. The same could be said of China, Vietnam, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany. None of these countries were ever socialist. It is easy for my opponent to argue against a straw man and to list all of the countries which called themselves socialist without actually being socialist. However, I think it would be far more productive for my opponent to argue against socialism as I defined it. This is, after all, a more traditional conception of socialism. Worker control and ownership is advocated by a wide range of Socialists, from Democratic Socialists to Anarchists to Council Communists/ Left-Marxists. Even if we go with my opponent's definition, the words ""collective ownership"" allow for an economy of worker cooperatives. I didn't have any space to present my contentions in Round 1. Now I do have space. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to put this in the first round, but since we aren't in the last round, it's okay to present contentions. Contention 1: Capitalism exploits workers; Socialism pays workers fairly. In order to make a profit, a Capitalist firm must spend less money than it makes. Moreover, the cost of producing and selling a product must be lower than the price of that product. I think we can all agree with that. This means that the people who produce and sell a product must be paid less money than the revenue which they generate through their labor. In other words, workers must be exploited if corporations are going to make any profit. This is basic logic, but maybe you still aren't convinced. If not, then I implore you to look at the numbers. Since 1948 average American pay went up 113% which sounds great until you learn that average productivity went up 254%. People are being paid less than half of what they produce. Socialism is more fair because when a worker cooperative spends less money than it makes, the profit goes back to the people who produced it -- the workers. Not only are wages voted on, but the excess revenue people produce goes to the people who produce it. Contention 2: Capitalism undermines democracy; Socialism strengthens democracy. In our Capitalist society, corporations and the individuals who get rich thanks to corporations have such a disproportionate amount of wealth that they can buy disproportionate amounts of political power. A Princeton study shows how damaging this is for democracy. ""A proposed policy change with low support among economically elite Americans (one-out-of-five in favour) is adopted only about 18% of the time,"" they write, ""while a proposed change with high support (four-out-of-five in favour) is adopted about 45% of the time.""

130,"For all intensive purposes, I will define bad as: of poor quality; deficient; inadequate or below standard; not satisfactory; liable to cause harm; disreputable or dishonorable; displaying a lack of skill, talent, proficiency or judgment; causing distress; unfavorable; not suitable; disagreeable; not profitable or worth the price paid; disappointing -- These words and definitions were taken from Dictionary.com, and please, I don't want this debate to be about semantics. So I would prefer if someone who accepted this debate did so based on conetent and not on the definition of 'bad' that I have provided if they disagree with it. With that said, my position in this debate is that George W. Bush was and still is a bad president throughout his tenure in office. My reasoning is based on these factors: - His broken promises regarding healthcare, the enviornment, higher education, free trade, and welfare; - Lies he told to the American public (probably to promote his own agenda); - His extremely low approval rating; - Facts about negative occurences during GWB's presidency, that are directly attributed to and/or are a result of his actions such as: the record for biggest annual deficit in history, he presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and refused to intervene when corruption was revealed, he is he dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history, etc... Because I am the instigator (Pro), the burden of proof is on me to prove that George W. Bush was/is a bad President. I believe that the facts and statistics speak volumes, so I will give my opponent the first opportunity to make his or her case against the topic of debate. Good luck!",1,Danielle,"

131,"Thanks to Mongeese for starting this debate. My opponent has attempted to affirm the resolution that ""When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."" His one and only argument to back this claim up was: ""People within the law would be required to give up their guns. Outlaws, people outside the law, would simply continue to resist the law as always, and keep their guns."" While I agree entirely with this assertion, my opponent has made a fatal flaw in his argument; he forgot about police officers and the fact that they can still own and carry guns even in countries where guns are entirely outlawed. Police officers are not ALL outlaws, yet all of them will still be allowed (required) to own, carry and operate guns. We can therefore conclude with certainty that were guns outlawed, it wouldn't be ONLY outlaws who have guns. It's a bit early to claim a win, but what the hell. Vote CON.",1,leet4A1,"

133,"The first round is just going to be for definitions and to accept the debate. White nationalism - ""*White nationalism is a political ideology which advocates a racial definition of national identity for white people."" [1] Many definitions claim that white nationalism wants a 100% white state, however this is inaccurate because many white nationalists support a white state which has heavy border controls that allow non-whites in, but limits immigration so that they remain minorities. Therefore, the 100% white state cannot accurately be used as a definition. Racism - ""The treatment or view, that someone is infearior because of their race."" This is oppose to simply viewing someone as ""different"" because of their race. Inherently - ""built-in: existing as an essential constituent or characteristic"" [2] My main arguement in this debate is going to be that extreme wings of white nationalism (namely white supremacism) have corrupted the public view of white nationalism really is, and so people believe that something is racist when only the extremes are.
