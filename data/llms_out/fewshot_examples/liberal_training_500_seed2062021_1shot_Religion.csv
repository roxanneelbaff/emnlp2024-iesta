However, I will use these more elementary disproofs for this debate and may post my complicated one either in the forum after this debate, or in my last rounds. Refutation 1: DNA is a genetic code, not a regular code. Regular codes work by way of symbols, something arbitrary and without meaning is GIVEN meaning by an intelligence. DNA genetic code works without symbols. Each nucleic acid is a thing in and of itself and combines to create larger chains. These chains interact with proteins that bind to them and form smaller amino acids that chain into new proteins. There is no meaning and no intelligence involved in the interpretation of DNA. Refutation 2: DNA is not a code, because it does not have arbitrary rules. All codes and languages are governed by arbitrary rules. Grammar and spelling evolve alongside a language. The rules for pig-latin were developed artificially. DNA is governed by the laws of physics, which neither evolve alongside it, or were developed artificially. SEE VIDEO IN CONJUNCTION WITH REFUTATION 3 & 4 Refutation 3: DNA may possibly resemble a code now, but it did not resemble one when it first developed. All codes and languages symbolize something even at the first utterance. DNA originated as amino acids inside a primitive membrane that merely bound to each other and replicated via physical force. Refutation 4: DNA is not a code because all codes could only have been made via intelligence. No known code could have possibly developed naturally. It is possible that DNA arose by way of the video above. Thus, DNA is not a code. Refutation 5: The ""code"" in Pt. 1 is not the ""code"" in Pt. 2- Equivalence fallacy. There are different definitions for the word ""code"". We classify DNA as a code because it shares some similarities to what we view to be codes. The information in DNA is not really information. DNA is not really a code. The notion that codes need to come from an intelligence stems from inductive proof of the actual term ""code"", not things that are similar to it. Refutation 6: All codes can be used by humans in order to express their own meanings. We can use English words, French words, Spanish words, morse code, and even binary in order to express ourselves. However, we cannot use the mechanisms of interpretation of DNA to send messages. Thus, DNA is not a code. Refutation 7: This argument is invalid because it is not scientific. <URL>...

Common mythologies tell us that, in addition to many gods who assume powers over nature, there are the demons and especially the little inhabits of the otherworld, fairies. I personally feel much more for the fairy. The fairy, who appears in tales and fables, has a much more subtle and powerful magic to them, ascribed through the use of symbolism, the images of rafts and waters--and so on: I digress. Contention one: Fairies have numerous origins, many of which are a status above that of demons A common belief of fairies is that they are a class of demoted angels who were too impure to remain in heaven, after our Father closed his gates to the fallen beings, but too pure for hell. In this case, fairies are subject to the Devil (who is excluded from this argument). It is common to say, ever since the stories of his fall, that with the devil fell one-third of the host of heaven. From this, I will make the following mini-arguments: 1. The hierarchy of angels is: seraphs, the messegers and pronouncers of god's glory, cherubs, thrones, dominions, archangels, and so on. Judging solely from the characterization of the devil in medieval and Renaissance works as a tricksters, a proud being, and a worker of macchintions and lies, I argue that the fairies, who, according to this belief, retained their purity, are more higher in the angel hierarchy...The virtues and the heavenly governors, and especially the seraphs and so forth, who are close to the glory of God, are supposed less vulnerable to temptations and lies than their servants. Another belief is that fairies were pagan deities (in Celtic tradition) who subsided to the authority of the Lord after their reign. For an instance, let us define what a god, the synonym of deity, is: (dictionary.com) ""one of several deities...presiding over some portion of worldly affairs."" A demon is merely ""an evil spirit"" who works harm but whose powers are limited. (arguments may rest on whether or not the pagan deities, of classical mythology--for example, are more or less powerful than the demon or servant of the devil). The word ""deity"" itself is associated with a sense of ethereal, heavenly power that is far superior to that of the demon or devil... Contention 2: The fairy's weaknesses are few compared to that of the demon. Fairies are vulnerable mainly to iron, which, according to common mythology, is like poison to them. However, they are not fearful of the church's bells, or the cross, holy items, or the presence of the priest as demons are. Contention 3: Good triumphs over evil. The basic stories have been that the forces of light, wise, careful, and powerful, have triumphed from now and then against the forces of darkness. Several examples include: 1. the triumph of Zeus, arguable the force of light--due to his connections with heaven, justice, order, and thunder, against Typhos, the child of Gaea and the storm giant after the Titans 2. the overthrow of Lucifer, the epitome of rebellion and chaos, by the hand of God 3. the classic story of Faust (Goethe) 4. numerous fairy tales in which the trapped prince, by a witch or evil spirit, or princess is freed and the villain defeated and so on. I do not think that fairies, who are connected with innocence and beauty, along with mischevious behavior, and childhood, are not exempt from this. Nor are the demons who, among others, encourage sorcery and witchcraft, sin (sloth, greed, and so on), violence, and are known for their animalistic bodies exempt from this either.

Let us go through our opponent""s case before making our own, shall we?  
  
""School is not meant for praying.""  
  
Now, my opponent says that school is not meant for praying. Thee is no rule against it. Just like school isn't meant for buying large amounts of food, it is still allowed and still happens.  
  
""It is just plain wrong to teach a student how to pray""  
  
So this suggests that they don't want their kid indoctrinated on how to pray. Many creationists do not want evolution to be the only thing taught but it still happens. Common courtesy would suggest to let us be able to pray too.  
  
""This is a violation to the amendment #1.""

11,"I would like to thank KRFournier for hosting this debate. I believe that this issue is an important one to clarify and that it clearly deserves the full treatment that a 3 round debate can grant it. I am for the resolution that morality is an idea. One can scour the entire universe, smash apart all its atoms and model the movement of all the celestial bodies within the bowels of a quantum computer the size of the sun and one will not find one ounce of morality. Morality does not exist any more than beauty or love or wonder exist. They exist within the depths of the human mind alongside angels, demons, and leprechauns. Morality is a human phenomenon, not a physical one. The life-giving sun has no more of a concept of morality than a rockslide. I contend that by default, nothing should be assumed to exist until proof is given. Because of this, I will spend the remainder of my round refuting my opponent's points, since it is up to him to prove that morality does exist as more than an idea. The crux of the first argument of my opponent's argument is the following statement: >When discussing the nature of morality, it's important that it be taken seriously. Every other statement within the first two paragraphs of the body of his argument depends on this statement. The fact that morality must be taken seriously does not grant it existence, making his point irrelevant to this debate. If morality is something other than a mere idea or concept, then morality has existence, whether physical or metaphysical. Mere necessity, however, is insufficient proof of something's existence. Humans need food, and because they need food, food is important that they have it. One would have to be insane, however, to say that the world's starving billions have food simply because it is important that they have it. Yes, it is important that morality be taken seriously, but it does not by any means imply that morality has existence outside of the human mind. >Moral distinction is the act of assessing the moral value of an action. Moral obligation is the act of holding another person or group of people to a specific moral standard. How is your definition of moral obligation anything other than a physical act, one that is exercised in accordance with an idea? >As soon as one person or group obligates another person or group to adhere to their moral distinctions, they are taking an absolute, objective moral position. No, they are merely attempting to pressure another person or group into conforming with their demands. In many ways, this is no different than, for example, exacting a monetary tribute, and indeed, many of our laws are enforced by doing just that. What do you mean by ""subjective"" morality? Do you mean a relativistic morality that is selectively applicable? Ideas can very easily function as ""objective"" moralities, and the ideas do not have to be good ones. A whimsical insistence that everyone must wear purple hats on April 13 of every year ending in 0 is every bit as objective and universal as Kant's categorical imperative if one is to take a lack of relativism to be the definition of objectivity. >The only way to be true to the notion that morality is an idea is to remain wholly within the realm of moral distinction and avoid moral obligation altogether. Are you saying that morality can't be an idea because people force others to act in accordance with it? This would imply that people can't act on ideas. This is preposterous, and I would suggest that you reconsider such statements. >If you truly believe morality to be subjective, then you must also believe by rational necessity that might makes right. If morality is an idea conceived and held subjectively, then it is defined by an individual's thoughts and feelings and not by might. Individual thoughts and feelings are not wholly subordinate to physical might. It is, in fact, very difficult to deliberately mold people's thoughts and feelings solely through the use of might. >This view of morality extends from my worldview and my belief in a transcendent, unchanging God.

Also, the problem with this view is that it is not established how God grounds objective moral values. I. Is something good because God commands it so or does God command it so because it is good? II. If something is good because the God commands that it is so, then what is morally reprehensible to us can be good. III. If God commands that it is good because it is good, then the good is greater than God. IV. So, either the good is arbitrary or good is greater than God. The Pro argues that God is good, that his very being is essentially good. If God""s essential nature is good, because it is good, it implies that the objective standard for what is good does not rest in God""s essential nature, but in good itself, or some other external standard of good. If on the other hand, God""s essential nature is good because good is whatever God""s essential nature is, then good is SUBJECTIVE rather than objective. This is because if God""s essential nature was such that he considered rape to be a good, and it is true that objective moral values are grounded in God, then rape would be objectively morally good. It also does not follow that just because an entity has an essential nature, that concepts derived from it, or dependent upon it, are objective. Bertrand Russell put it this way: ""The point I am concerned with is that, if you are quite sure there is a difference between right and wrong, then you are then in this situation: is that difference due to God's fiat or is it not? If it is due to God's fiat, then for God himself there is no difference between right and wrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is good."" As a human beings, our genetic make-up imbues us with predispositions towards all kinds of feelings, impulses, likes and dislikes, this is our nature. But this does not mean that the moral impulses that arise from our genetically determined predispositions represent intrinsic truths about reality. No, they simply represent our subjective feelings on an issue. Therefore, even if it were true that God exists, and has a nature, and that nature was synonymous with goodness, any moral values derived from God would still be SUBJECTIVE. So even if it could be established that objective moral values do exist, they could not possibly be dependent upon a supernatural foundation, aka God. Premise 2: The Pro insists on claiming that objective moral values come from God, but it needs to be explain why people who believe this hold widely divergent views on many moral issues "" such as divorce, abortion, homosexuality, and tithing, etc. If objective moral values do exist, there must be a single objectively moral position on all these issues, yet there are many divisions among believers regarding what is objectively moral and what is not. On what basis are believers supposed to decide what the objective moral truth is when there are several competing alleged objective moral values among believers? It is amusing that the Pro uses the argument of atheistic diversity in moral beliefs as a way to denounce a natural foundation for morals, yet believers are in just as much conflict, the only difference and it is a major one, is that believers our supposed to have one source for their morality, God. If believers want to claim that God is the source of objective moral values, then it should be the case that there is a reliable way for determining what those values actually are! Here is what one believer said about his actions: ""...Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator."" Adolf Hitler; Mein Kampf Vol.1 Ch.2 Conclusion: The Pro needs to explain to all of us where we can find this supernatural foundation for objective morality. It seems as though he does not want to tell us even though we all know it is the Bible, he is a Baptist after all. How does he know that God is loving, generous, faithful, kind? He has not proved this, it is an assumption. If the Pros source is the Bible then show us objective morals from it. Prove to us that god is good by his own nature. How can one prove the foundation of morality without showing where it came from, or how it came about and what it is. Not all statements can be proven merely on a philosophical level, sometimes it is necessary to prove a point based on evidence, where is your evidence for this supernatural foundation for morality? How do you know what is right or wrong? Your first posting made so many assumptions that it's strange to me that you believe this. Again the first premise in his argument ( which is not really his argument, since it has been around long before either one of us was born) presupposes the conclusion and fails! The Pro needs to deal with this failure and acknowledge it by defending it properly or concede. Secondly, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that objective moral values do exist. So how can he prove a foundation when he cannot prove that objective morals exist? He can say they exist but cannot prove it because he has given us no proof, just assumptions based on a philosophical argument. The second premise of the moral argument, therefore, fails as well. He needs to deal with this or concede as well. Not only does this argument fail to prove that objective morals exist, it fails to prove that god exists let alone any supernatural being establishing a FOUNDATION for said morality. This is just the Divine Command Theory argument popularized in recent years by William Lane Craig, and it still fails to show whether god's commands could be considered objective rather than arbitrary!

Premise 2: The Pro insists on claiming that objective moral values come from God, but it needs to be explain why people who believe this hold widely divergent views on many moral issues "" such as divorce, abortion, homosexuality, and tithing, etc. If objective moral values do exist, there must be a single objectively moral position on all these issues, yet there are many divisions among believers regarding what is objectively moral and what is not. On what basis are believers supposed to decide what the objective moral truth is when there are several competing alleged objective moral values among believers? It is amusing that the Pro uses the argument of atheistic diversity in moral beliefs as a way to denounce a natural foundation for morals, yet believers are in just as much conflict, the only difference and it is a major one, is that believers our supposed to have one source for their morality, God.  
If believers want to claim that God is the source of objective moral values, then it should be the case that there is a reliable way for determining what those values actually are!  
  
Here is what one believer said about his actions:  
  
""...Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator."" Adolf Hitler; Mein Kampf Vol.1 Ch.2  
  
Conclusion:  
The Pro needs to explain to all of us where we can find this supernatural foundation for objective morality. It seems as though he does not want to tell us even though we all know it is the Bible, he is a Baptist after all. How does he know that God is loving, generous, faithful, kind? He has not proved this, it is an assumption. If the Pros source is the Bible then show us objective morals from it. Prove to us that god is good by his own nature. How can one prove the foundation of morality without showing where it came from, or how it came about and what it is. Not all statements can be proven merely on a philosophical level, sometimes it is necessary to prove a point based on evidence, where is your evidence for this supernatural foundation for morality? How do you know what is right or wrong? Your first posting made so many assumptions that it's strange to me that you believe this.  
  
Again the first premise in his argument ( which is not really his argument, since it has been around long before either one of us was born) presupposes the conclusion and fails! The Pro needs to deal with this failure and acknowledge it by defending it properly or concede. Secondly, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that objective moral values do exist. So how can he prove a foundation when he cannot prove that objective morals exist? He can say they exist but cannot prove it because he has given us no proof, just assumptions based on a philosophical argument. The second premise of the moral argument, therefore, fails as well. He needs to deal with this or concede as well. Not only does this argument fail to prove that objective morals exist, it fails to prove that god exists let alone any supernatural being establishing a FOUNDATION for said morality. This is just the Divine Command Theory argument popularized in recent years by William Lane Craig, and it still fails to show whether god's commands could be considered objective rather than arbitrary!

Let's take a look at the ten commandments--ESPECIALLY the one that says, ""Thou shalt not kill."" The commandment is about respect for human life. God asks us to demonstrate love and not hate towards others by not murdering. We must learn to control our tempers. Taking another person's life is not our right to decide. That judgment is reserved for God alone. That is the thrust of this Commandment. God does not allow us to choose to wilfully or deliberately take another person's life. The Sixth Commandment reminds us that God is the giver of life and He alone has the authority to take it or to grant permission to take it. God wants us to go far beyond avoiding murder. He requires that we not maliciously harm another human being in word or deed. This is why John wrote, "" Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him "" 1 John 3:15 . God desires that we treat even those who choose to hate us respectfully and do all within our power to live in peace and harmony with them. He wants us to be builders, not destroyers of good relationships. To accomplish this we must respect this wonderful gift of this precious possession, human life.

Let's take a look at what King Solomon has to say: Everything has an appointed season, and there is a time for every matter under the heaven. A time to give birth and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot that which is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break and a time to build. A time to weep and a time to laugh; a time of wailing and a time of dancing. A time to cast stones and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. A time to seek and a time to lose; a time to keep and a time to cast away. A time to rend and a time to sew; a time to be silent and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace. You see, there are times where war is necessary. The reason G-d ordered the genocide is because he knew that they would be trouble. You know who the number 1 enemies of Israel are today? Iran/Iraq! You know who they were back then? The same people G-d ordered to eradicate. G-d is all-knowing as well as all-loving; therefore, sometimes he does things that make us question.

This scenario informs us that God is restricted to what he can and cannot do by his own power. Since he cannot create a stone which he cannot lift. 2. The second scenario is that God can create a stone which he cannot lift. This scenario informs us that God can create anything, including items that have power or some attribute that exceeds his own.

Being that the Christian God is defined as all-powerful and omnipotent, he should, in theory, be able to do anything. However, since the Christian God cannot create a stone which he cannot lift or he can create a stone which he cannot lift, it becomes apparent that the Christian God is not the all-powerful being that the Bible and Christian religion make him out to be.

20,"Thank you, 000ike, for your response. I have agreed with my opponent on every point he's made up until the third and final round, where he contradicts his previous statements at nearly every syllable. There are a few points I could go into detail about. For instance, he claims that God is the moral standard by which we measure the actions we ""ought"" to do. This contradicts his most precious contention that we have no free will, as actions that we ""ought"" to do implies actions that we ""can"" do. But most importantly, my opponent himself asserts ""If God exists as the being which decides who does and does not go to heaven, then morality is the board of laws through which one would be accepted in heaven."" Therefore, God decides what is moral and what isn't moral, despite our own perceptions. If that's the case, then when God sends a soul to Hell, it IS justified. Let me explain this scenario a bit more articulately. There are only two possibilities: 1. When God sends a soul to Hell, it is moral. 2. When God sends a soul to Hell, it is immoral. If the former is true (which my opponent seems to think is the case), then as I've said, Hell IS justified for whichever souls are sent there. If the latter is true, then God is doing an immoral act by sending them there, and deserves the punishment of Hell Himself. It is logically impossible for those souls to not deserve Hell AND for God to be moral. It is equally logically impossible for those souls to deserve Hell AND for my opponent to win this debate (as it would go against his original proposition). Finally, I will address the only remaining challenge posed by my opponent: the challenge to prove that God sends people to Hell. I cannot prove this, ladies and gentlemen. At least, not with empirical evidence. However, I need only remind you of my opponent's own definition, that God is ""the one Supreme Being, the creator and ruler of the universe."" [1] It should be patently obvious that God, being the ""ruler of the universe"", is responsible for everything that happens within it, including the sending of souls to Hell. Furthermore, even if God DOESN'T send them to Hell directly, He was still the one who gave humans souls (yet no free will), and who created Hell to punish those souls, as explained by my opponent in the first round (the ""no free will"" bit in the second round). In conclusion, I find my opponent's proposition to be false. I thank you, 000ike, for engaging in this interesting debate with me, and the audience for listening to my ramblings.

This contradicts his most precious contention that we have no free will, as actions that we ""ought"" to do implies actions that we ""can"" do.  
  
But most importantly, my opponent himself asserts ""If God exists as the being which decides who does and does not go to heaven, then morality is the board of laws through which one would be accepted in heaven."" Therefore, God decides what is moral and what isn't moral, despite our own perceptions. If that's the case, then when God sends a soul to Hell, it IS justified.  
  
Let me explain this scenario a bit more articulately. There are only two possibilities:  
1. When God sends a soul to Hell, it is moral.  
2. When God sends a soul to Hell, it is immoral.  
  
If the former is true (which my opponent seems to think is the case), then as I've said, Hell IS justified for whichever souls are sent there. If the latter is true, then God is doing an immoral act by sending them there, and deserves the punishment of Hell Himself.  
  
It is logically impossible for those souls to not deserve Hell AND for God to be moral. It is equally logically impossible for those souls to deserve Hell AND for my opponent to win this debate (as it would go against his original proposition).  
  
Finally, I will address the only remaining challenge posed by my opponent: the challenge to prove that God sends people to Hell. I cannot prove this, ladies and gentlemen. At least, not with empirical evidence. However, I need only remind you of my opponent's own definition, that God is ""the one Supreme Being, the creator and ruler of the universe."" [1] It should be patently obvious that God, being the ""ruler of the universe"", is responsible for everything that happens within it, including the sending of souls to Hell.  
  
Furthermore, even if God DOESN'T send them to Hell directly, He was still the one who gave humans souls (yet no free will), and who created Hell to punish those souls, as explained by my opponent in the first round (the ""no free will"" bit in the second round).  
  
In conclusion, I find my opponent's proposition to be false.  
  
I thank you, 000ike, for engaging in this interesting debate with me, and the audience for listening to my ramblings.

Introduction  
==================  
  
I extend my highest approbation to abard for his kindness in this debate. He makes a great case with his ""filling in the blanks"" hypothesis. However, and unfortunately, his case is sorely wanting in the area most fundamental for the fulfillment of his burden – I will expound on this below.  
  
==================  
As science explains, people believe less?  
==================  
  
My opponent's entire premise erodes beneath him because its very foundation is unsound! He says that, due to science, people are now less likely to believe in god(s). This could never more untrue! Atheism is in decline worldwide (1). Munich theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg has said, ""Atheism as a theoretical position is in decline worldwide."" Alister McGrath, an Oxford Historian, in his book, ""The Twilight of Atheism,"" meticulously explicates this phenomenon – pointing out that if atheism is the nexus of reason and science, why has it become so rare by the turn of the 21st century? In a recent article, McGrath comments on atheism's future saying it, ""seems increasingly to lie in the private beliefs of individuals rather than in the great public domain it once regarded as its habitat.""  
Belief in God is actually increasingly globally – steady and persistent.  
  
==================  
Point of a Personal God  
==================  
  
This is the crucial and fundamental point that my opponent misunderstood (I'm sorry if it was not entirely clear). There is no reason for people to make up a personal god – one who is deeply interactive and participatory. My opponent's argument would rightly apply to a deistic understanding, but certainly not a theistic one. The god of deism serves only to fill in the so-called scientific blanks. But the god(s) of theism could not have sprung from a similar desire to fill in the blanks, as its interactive and participatory initiative with mankind fills no blanks – there was never any need to posit a PERSONAL god(s) in the first place!  
  
==================  
Moral Propositions and Logical Absolutes  
==================  
  
My point was not that someone cannot be moral or logical absent god, but the very fact that all cultures, near and far, adhere to the principles of logic and all make moral proposition is societal evidence that favors the existence of God.  
  
==================  
Does the article support this claim?  
==================  
  
My opponent suggests that the article listed in round 1 actually supports his claim. This is thoroughly untrue. First, you need not know all the complex mechanisms of evolution in order to believe that it is true – most all of its adherents have only a superficial understanding. But what the article shows is that, from birth, human-beings are predisposed to believe in god. This means that it is not something that springs from society, but something that is innate.  
  
==================  
Grand Assumption  
==================  
  
When I stated that my opponent's grand assumption was that he actually thinks the human tendency to believe in God is evidence that God does NOT exist!, he responded saying, ""Yes and no. I'm saying that that is a major part, and the more science that is readily available to society, the fewer people believe in God.""  
  
As already pointed it, this analysis is completely wrong. As Phil Zuckerman points out in a recent presentation on his findings from surveying non-belief – atheism is on a worldwide decline (2).  
  
==================  
Conclusion  
==================  
My opponent's thesis relies on a flawed assumption and therefore falls short of fulfilling his burden. Atheism is not on the increase, but on a worldwide decrease. Moreover, if we are innately predisposed to believe in God, then there is no reason to believe that God sprung from a societal pattern, but an innate one.

31,"Thanks again to my opponent for this interesting and enjoyable debate. ""I am not debating the human's life cycle, rather the reason for the human's life."" Me too and as I said survival and reproduction are reasons for the continuation of human life. Organisms exist so that cells can duplicate themselves more effectively. This is a reason for life. ""Pleasure is a temporary experience, and is forgotten almost instantly, and when one dies what did his pleasures matter?"" Pleasure is not purely temporary. Recalling pleasurable experiences can bring renewed pleasure. Long lasting pleasure can be achieved through a loving relationship, through childbirth as discussed previously and also through less tangible means like the satisfaction of past achievements. People often talk about one's life 'flashing before your eyes' when you face death. In this instance a life filled with pleasure would surely give more satisfaction and meaning than a life filled with self-denial and declined opportunities. ""According to my opponent's arguments, a sterile person has no meaning to his life."" Childbirth was only one of several ways I suggested that a person could find meaning in life. While a sterile person's life may have no biological purpose, it can still be filled with meaning. Also by adopting or otherwise raising a child as your own a person can experience all the emotional life-affirming benefits of having children of their own, not least the satisfaction of nurturing and caring for an individual who may go on to have kids themselves. ""TEMPORARY desires are meaningless"" No, permanent desires are meaningless because they can never be attained. ""The words of King Solomon are complex to the extreme-there are many opinions as to what he is trying to say. I will go by the view that says as follows..."" As my opponent accepts that his interpretation of 'The Philosopher's' words is only one of many and I have provided a perfectly valid alternative interpretation, I don't think he can build much of a case around Ecclesiastes. Negated. ---------------------- The meaning of life is of course totally subjective and I think arguing that any one thing is the only true meaning of life is intrinsically flawed as well as impossible to prove. One's life has meaning only to the extent that one applies meaning to it. My opponent has not explicitly stated what he believes the meaning of life to be, but as he states that it precludes atheism and everything temporary, I can only assume that it is something along the lines of 'serve God so you can go to Heaven'. The problem with this is that a life lived for this purpose only has meaning if your beliefs are in fact true. Imagine there's no heaven (RIP J.L.) If this is the case then a life devoted to reaching Heaven is entirely meaningless. All people of faith must experience doubt at some point and I would have thought that these doubts would become most acute when death is immediately anticipated. If you hold the conviction that there is no afterlife then a life of duty, devotion and sacrifice to religion is pointless and without meaning, as I argued regarding Ecclesiastes. To conclude this debate, I will draw on the work of some of the many philosophers who have considered this age old question and come to conclusions that are completely at odds with my opponent. These are all from Wikipedia (lazy I know) but can easily be backed up elsewhere. ""In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the Idea (Form) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value. Human beings are duty-bound to pursue the good, but no one can succeed in that pursuit without philosophical reasoning, which allows for true knowledge."" <URL>...

Thanks again to my opponent for this interesting and enjoyable debate.  
  
""I am not debating the human's life cycle, rather the reason for the human's life.""  
  
Me too and as I said survival and reproduction are reasons for the continuation of human life. Organisms exist so that cells can duplicate themselves more effectively. This is a reason for life.  
  
""Pleasure is a temporary experience, and is forgotten almost instantly, and when one dies what did his pleasures matter?""  
  
Pleasure is not purely temporary.  
Recalling pleasurable experiences can bring renewed pleasure.  
Long lasting pleasure can be achieved through a loving relationship, through childbirth as discussed previously and also through less tangible means like the satisfaction of past achievements.  
  
People often talk about one's life 'flashing before your eyes' when you face death. In this instance a life filled with pleasure would surely give more satisfaction and meaning than a life filled with self-denial and declined opportunities.  
  
""According to my opponent's arguments, a sterile person has no meaning to his life.""  
  
Childbirth was only one of several ways I suggested that a person could find meaning in life. While a sterile person's life may have no biological purpose, it can still be filled with meaning.  
Also by adopting or otherwise raising a child as your own a person can experience all the emotional life-affirming benefits of having children of their own, not least the satisfaction of nurturing and caring for an individual who may go on to have kids themselves.  
  
""TEMPORARY desires are meaningless""  
  
No, permanent desires are meaningless because they can never be attained.  
  
""The words of King Solomon are complex to the extreme-there are many opinions as to what he is trying to say. I will go by the view that says as follows...""  
  
As my opponent accepts that his interpretation of 'The Philosopher's' words is only one of many and I have provided a perfectly valid alternative interpretation, I don't think he can build much of a case around Ecclesiastes.  
Negated.  
  
----------------------  
The meaning of life is of course totally subjective and I think arguing that any one thing is the only true meaning of life is intrinsically flawed as well as impossible to prove.  
One's life has meaning only to the extent that one applies meaning to it.  
  
My opponent has not explicitly stated what he believes the meaning of life to be, but as he states that it precludes atheism and everything temporary, I can only assume that it is something along the lines of 'serve God so you can go to Heaven'.  
The problem with this is that a life lived for this purpose only has meaning if your beliefs are in fact true.  
Imagine there's no heaven (RIP J.L.) If this is the case then a life devoted to reaching Heaven is entirely meaningless.  
  
All people of faith must experience doubt at some point and I would have thought that these doubts would become most acute when death is immediately anticipated. If you hold the conviction that there is no afterlife then a life of duty, devotion and sacrifice to religion is pointless and without meaning, as I argued regarding Ecclesiastes.  
  
To conclude this debate, I will draw on the work of some of the many philosophers who have considered this age old question and come to conclusions that are completely at odds with my opponent. These are all from Wikipedia (lazy I know) but can easily be backed up elsewhere.  
  
""In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the Idea (Form) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value. Human beings are duty-bound to pursue the good, but no one can succeed in that pursuit without philosophical reasoning, which allows for true knowledge.""

This is asinine to the extreme. CON would either like you to believe that i) by killing living beings in their prime, you learn the value of life, or that ii) ""killing for the glory of God"" is the path to forgiveness and salvation. i) By this measure, Cain learned the value of life by killing Abel, and that what Cain did by killing Abel was righteous, as much so if not even more so than Abel's killing of animals for the glory of God. This is a moral contradiction in CON's argument, as Cain was condemned for such killing and not held to be righteous. ii) If there is such a thing as ""killing for the glory of God"", perhaps we can say that Osama bin Laden ""killed for the glory of God"" when he carried out the 9/11 attacks, or that we ""killed for the glory of God"" when we dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The morality that CON wants you to think the Bible is advocating is absurdly contradictory and can be used to justify the most heinous acts of genocide and terror.

Completely destroy them--the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--as the Lord your God has commanded you.

"" (Deuteronomy 20:17-18) ""... they set fire to the city and burned it to the ground, along with everything in it... "" (Joshua 6:24) The Jews of Joshua bear much resemblance to the pastoral Mongols of Genghis Khan, who were also genocidal, monotheistic, and marauding. What is Detestable is Arbitrary What were these ""detestable things [the Canaanites] do in worshiping their gods?"" We can look to Cain and Abel and a bit of Jewish history to get an answer. The Jews were pastoral. They managed livestock while in Egypt, and took what animals were under their care when they left (Exodus 12:31-32). Job's wealth was measured in the livestock he managed, not in the numbers of acres he tilled (Job 1:1-3). The Jews evidently favored meat and livestock over farming. And so, of course Cain the farmer is evil, and Abel the shepherder is good in the eyes of a Jewish God. This is all Biblical morality boils down to when it comes to the story of Cain and Abel - Cain was evil because he was a farmer. Such a standard of morality is absolutely arbitrary...the civilizations of Eden (i.e. the Tigris and Euphrates, Genesis 2:14) that grew crops in the Fertile Crescent would have considered the Jews and their marauding ways to be evil, a sentiment which manifested in the Jews' Babylonian captivity and enslavement (book of Daniel).

This fully supports that God created Cain to be evil, that God created evil at the very least in the instance of Cain.

So Cain was banished to the east (which happens to be where the Fertile Crescent was located).

Do as you want, but no reasons to flaunt, this theological transfusion.  
  
I want to reiterate, before I obliterate, the problem perceived,  
The logical problems inherent, apparent, to connect it to what is believed,  
The after-the-fact notion to this promotion, that's not preconceived,  
It's a false source of divinity, and even the trinity, so nothings achieved.  
  
The commentator Rashi: He's inclined to opine, that it's humility that is key,

""In the Zohar it says..."" What?, that's not three names, don't get me started.  
  
""Hear oh Israel, ""Gods name"" is your god, ""God's name"" is one"" is a better translation,  
""How can three names be one?"" you ask, well that's already faced total negation.  
It's easy to rebuild, make it fulfilled, if the scripture faces this type of mutilation,  
But that is not what it means, however it seems, in any single OT location.  
  
""Hear oh Israel, Hashem (the name) is your god, Hashem is ONE""  
That's what it's saying, to only one we are praying, no matter how it is spun,

As I did in the last round, I will explain how the existence of 'stuff' is evidence of a creator. For anything that we can observe, there is always something that caused it to be how it is. That thing must also have a cause, and that cause must also have one.

It can also be said that the concept of an infinite chain of sequences is incomprehensible. Therefore, a reasonable person could easily accept that there must have been a first cause. However, it is true that all things natural, as far as we can tell, require a cause. Therefore, if there is a first cause, it must be a supernatural force. Still with me?

45,"Thank you for such a timely response. Strawman: the 10 commandments are not the only commandments. In fact, there are 613 commandments that G-d gave to Moses. Strawman: We are created in G-d's image; therefore, he is flawed. Remember: this was BEFORE the fall. What does it mean to be created in G-d's image? The image of God refers to the immaterial part of man. It sets man apart from the animal world, fits him for the dominion God intended him to have over the earth (Genesis 1:28), and enables him to commune with his Maker. It is a likeness mentally, morally, and socially. Mentally, man was created as a rational, volitional agent. In other words, man can reason and man can choose. This is a reflection of God's intellect and freedom. Anytime someone invents a machine, writes a book, paints a landscape, enjoys a symphony, calculates a sum, or names a pet, he or she is proclaiming the fact that we are made in God's image. Morally, man was created in righteousness and perfect innocence, a reflection of God's holiness. God saw all He had made (mankind included) and called it ""very good"" (Genesis 1:31). Our conscience or ""moral compass"" is a vestige of that original state. Whenever someone writes a law, recoils from evil, praises good behavior, or feels guilty, he is confirming the fact that we are made in God's own image. Socially, man was created for fellowship. This reflects God's triune nature and His love. In Eden, man's primary relationship was with God (Genesis 3:8 implies fellowship with God), and God made the first woman because ""it is not good for the man to be alone"" (Genesis 2:18). Every time someone marries, makes a friend, hugs a child, or attends church, he is demonstrating the fact that we are made in the likeness of God. Part of being made in God's image is that Adam had the capacity to make free choices. Although he was given a righteous nature, Adam made an evil choice to rebel against his Creator. In so doing, Adam marred the image of God within himself, and he passed that damaged likeness on to all his descendants (Romans 5:12). Today, we still bear the image of God (James 3:9), but we also bear the scars of sin. Mentally, morally, socially, and physically, we show the effects of sin. Source: <URL>... We see that it was a spiritual sense. He had the capacity to make a free choice. He was given a righteous nature; but chose to rebell against it. I love how you continue to ignore the fact that G-d is perfect, by definition, and thus cannot sin. War =/= murder? And you are right on that one because war doesn't necessarily equal murder. However, that is only because murder implies intent/motive and premeditation, where as God's armies followed blindly and killed for no other reason than because they were told to. So God's followers were killers and God is the murderer. And who created war? Who created sin? Who created evil? GOD DID. God IS all knowing, he knew how the events of the world would unfold yet created it anyways. God cannot be just if he created evil. God cannot be good if he created evil. Thus, God contradicts himself and must, by every definition, be flawed. My opponent admits that war=/=murder. What is murder? In order to be considered murder, the killing must be both premeditated and intentional. Since embryonic stem cell research results in the premeditated, intentional killing of a human being, Christian theology would consider it to be murder. This is scriptural. <URL>... ""Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man. ( Genesis 9:6 ) The verse that I gave you clearly says that there is a time to kill. Who created evil? Good question! . Evil has no existence of its own; it is really the absence of good. For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else. We call the absence of dirt a hole, but it cannot be separated from the dirt. So when God created, it is true that all He created was good. One of the good things God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good. In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose. So, God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or reject good (evil). When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a ""thing"" that required God to create it. Perhaps a further illustration will help. If a person is asked, ""Does cold exist?"" the answer would likely be ""yes."" However, this is incorrect. Cold does not exist. Cold is the absence of heat. Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light. Evil is the absence of good, or better, evil is the absence of God. God did not have to create evil, but rather only allow for the absence of good. God did not create evil, but He does allow evil. If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, both mankind and angels would be serving God out of obligation, not choice. He did not want ""robots"" that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their ""programming."" God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could gen <URL>... Thank you for this debate.

Whenever someone writes a law, recoils from evil, praises good behavior, or feels guilty, he is confirming the fact that we are made in God’s own image.  Socially, man was created for fellowship. This reflects God's triune nature and His love. In Eden, man’s primary relationship was with God (Genesis 3:8 implies fellowship with God), and God made the first woman because “it is not good for the man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). Every time someone marries, makes a friend, hugs a child, or attends church, he is demonstrating the fact that we are made in the likeness of God.  Part of being made in God’s image is that Adam had the capacity to make free choices. Although he was given a righteous nature, Adam made an evil choice to rebel against his Creator. In so doing, Adam marred the image of God within himself, and he passed that damaged likeness on to all his descendants (Romans 5:12). Today, we still bear the image of God (James 3:9), but we also bear the scars of sin. Mentally, morally, socially, and physically, we show the effects of sin.   Source:   http://www.gotquestions.org...  We see that it was a spiritual sense. He had the capacity to make a free choice. He was given a righteous nature; but chose to rebell against it.  I love how you continue to ignore the fact that G-d is perfect, by definition, and thus cannot sin.   War =/= murder? And you are right on that one because war doesn't necessarily equal murder. However, that is only because murder implies intent/motive and premeditation, where as God's armies followed blindly and killed for no other reason than because they were told to. So God's followers were killers and God is the murderer.  And who created war? Who created sin? Who created evil? GOD DID. God IS all knowing, he knew how the events of the world would unfold yet created it anyways. God cannot be just if he created evil. God cannot be good if he created evil. Thus, God contradicts himself and must, by every definition, be flawed.  My opponent admits that war=/=murder. What is murder? In order to be considered murder, the killing must be both premeditated and intentional. Since embryonic stem cell research results in the premeditated, intentional killing of a human being, Christian theology would consider it to be murder. This is scriptural.  http://www.godandscience.org...  
  ""Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be shed, For in the image of God He made man. (  Genesis 9:6  )  
     
  The verse that I gave you clearly says that there is a time to kill.   Who created evil? Good question!  . Evil has no existence of its own; it is really the absence of good. For example, holes are real but they only exist in something else. We call the absence of dirt a hole, but it cannot be separated from the dirt. So when God created, it is true that all He created was good. One of the good things God made was creatures who had the freedom to choose good. In order to have a real choice, God had to allow there to be something besides good to choose. So, God allowed these free angels and humans to choose good or reject good (evil). When a bad relationship exists between two good things we call that evil, but it does not become a “thing” that required God to create it.  Perhaps a further illustration will help. If a person is asked, “Does cold exist?” the answer would likely be “yes.” However, this is incorrect. Cold does not exist. Cold is the absence of heat. Similarly, darkness does not exist; it is the absence of light. Evil is the absence of good, or better, evil is the absence of God. God did not have to create evil, but rather only allow for the absence of good.  God did not create evil, but He does allow evil. If God had not allowed for the possibility of evil, both mankind and angels would be serving God out of obligation, not choice. He did not want “robots” that simply did what He wanted them to do because of their “programming.” God allowed for the possibility of evil so that we could gen  http://www.gotquestions.org...

52,"I regretfully point out that my opponent's last post was nothing but accusations and poor sportsmanship. First, my opponent makes a brazen statement where he accuses me of saying something that I absolutely did not say. This is an obvious strawman fallacy since he then goes on to make an irrelevant argument against my alleged statement. Please do not listen to his lies, I never made any statement saying that DNA is a ""random, good-for-nothing pattern"", this is a figment of his imagination. My opponent claims that since DNA contains information, then DNA is a code. This is untrue as *everything* contains information. This is the essential flaw in his argument. My opponent assumes that the information we see in DNA is the same type of information from a computer chip or a website. What he does not understand is that although we can interpret DNA as a type of information, it actually is not, because it does not involve mental interpretation, but pure physical reaction. This is what makes it differ from all other types of information and why we cannot consider DNA to be a true code and a code developed by intelligence, but rather, a genetic code. My opponent cannot resolve this issue and has not resolved this issue. My opponent then goes on to make an argument that assumes that I conceded that patterns are the same as codes. I have made no such concession and will not. Codes involve mental interpretation, patterns are observed order, DNA is just a physical substance that humans can use as a code, but it is not naturally a code. My opponent then argues by design, using many design arguments that are highly illogical and fallacious. He has already proposed that we discuss it outside this debate, so I shall ignore all his arguments by design and simply tell him and the audience that I have answers to every single one of his arguments regarding Intelligent Design and hope to debate him on it afterwards. My opponent claims that since life comes from DNA, then it must be a code. Life comes from amino acids, from atoms, from molecules, these things are not codes either, they are physical occurrences just like DNA. The way that DNA builds life is not coding, but pure and undirected physical reaction. My opponent makes another claim that since we see DNA as a code, then it is a code. I have addressed this. Through the eyes of a layman, a simple-minded and non-scientific person, or one who is only superficial in knowledge, DNA will be a code. However, close examination and understanding shows how our own flaws in knowledge and understanding form this incorrect notion. Finally, my opponent argues that if DNA is not a code, then it should not be unique. First of all, this is a non sequitor. Something that is a code need not be unique and things that are not codes are not always commonplace. Second of all, DNA is not unique, RNA exists via a slightly different mechanism but almost the same. Third, my opponent does not understand evolution if he does not know why DNA seems to be the most prominent. It is because DNA out-competed others, as was shown in the video that my opponent obviously did not read. This is why there is 1 species of human as opposed to 500 similar species of human and why there is 1 dominant form of genetic code as opposed to 500. In conclusion: My opponent can offer absolutely no arguments. I have set forth a variety of rebuttals for the logical fallacy of his argument and he has not directly addressed even one of them, only go in a roundabout fashion to make different arguments.

We see DNA superficially as a code because with DNA, we as humans can do several things with it, such as draw information from it. Since we can do X,Y,Z with DNA and X,Y,Z with other codes, we designate DNA as a code in that particular way. I can drink from a bowl and I can drink from a cup, but that does not make a bowl a cup. There are intrinsic differences between a bowl and a cup and there are intrinsic differences between DNA and normal codes. These differences were clearly illustrated and unrefuted.

I regretfully point out that my opponent's last post was nothing but accusations and poor sportsmanship. First, my opponent makes a brazen statement where he accuses me of saying something that I absolutely did not say. This is an obvious strawman fallacy since he then goes on to make an irrelevant argument against my alleged statement. Please do not listen to his lies, I never made any statement saying that DNA is a ""random, good-for-nothing pattern"", this is a figment of his imagination.  
  
My opponent claims that since DNA contains information, then DNA is a code. This is untrue as *everything* contains information. This is the essential flaw in his argument. My opponent assumes that the information we see in DNA is the same type of information from a computer chip or a website. What he does not understand is that although we can interpret DNA as a type of information, it actually is not, because it does not involve mental interpretation, but pure physical reaction. This is what makes it differ from all other types of information and why we cannot consider DNA to be a true code and a code developed by intelligence, but rather, a genetic code. My opponent cannot resolve this issue and has not resolved this issue.  
  
My opponent then goes on to make an argument that assumes that I conceded that patterns are the same as codes. I have made no such concession and will not. Codes involve mental interpretation, patterns are observed order, DNA is just a physical substance that humans can use as a code, but it is not naturally a code.  
  
My opponent then argues by design, using many design arguments that are highly illogical and fallacious. He has already proposed that we discuss it outside this debate, so I shall ignore all his arguments by design and simply tell him and the audience that I have answers to every single one of his arguments regarding Intelligent Design and hope to debate him on it afterwards.  
  
My opponent claims that since life comes from DNA, then it must be a code. Life comes from amino acids, from atoms, from molecules, these things are not codes either, they are physical occurrences just like DNA. The way that DNA builds life is not coding, but pure and undirected physical reaction.  
  
My opponent makes another claim that since we see DNA as a code, then it is a code. I have addressed this. Through the eyes of a layman, a simple-minded and non-scientific person, or one who is only superficial in knowledge, DNA will be a code. However, close examination and understanding shows how our own flaws in knowledge and understanding form this incorrect notion.  
  
Finally, my opponent argues that if DNA is not a code, then it should not be unique. First of all, this is a non sequitor. Something that is a code need not be unique and things that are not codes are not always commonplace. Second of all, DNA is not unique, RNA exists via a slightly different mechanism but almost the same. Third, my opponent does not understand evolution if he does not know why DNA seems to be the most prominent. It is because DNA out-competed others, as was shown in the video that my opponent obviously did not read. This is why there is 1 species of human as opposed to 500 similar species of human and why there is 1 dominant form of genetic code as opposed to 500.  
  
In conclusion:  
  
My opponent can offer absolutely no arguments. I have set forth a variety of rebuttals for the logical fallacy of his argument and he has not directly addressed even one of them, only go in a roundabout fashion to make different arguments. Whereas mine were direct disproofs, my opponent simply made arguments for his case that of themselves were logically fallacious or rebutted above.  
  
Please do not be fooled by my opponent's inclusion of design argument because design argument is inherently filled with logical flaws. Since he has not proven Intelligent Design, it cannot be admitted as evidence.  
  
WHY MY OPPONENT'S ARGUMENT FAILS:  
  
A more complicated summary is simply that this argument is based on semantics. We see DNA superficially as a code because with DNA, we as humans can do several things with it, such as draw information from it. Since we can do X,Y,Z with DNA and X,Y,Z with other codes, we designate DNA as a code in that particular way.

However, his argument that the concept of omnipotent is limited to ""a deity that is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature"" is incorrect. ""When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, ""I am God Almighty' "" as quoted from Genesis 17:1 and again in Genesis 35:11 ""And God said to him, ""I am God Almighty.' "" God does this in Exodus 6:3 ""I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty."" In each of these bible verses and in many others, God introduces himself as God the Almighty. Now, as my opponent has set forth the definition and meaning of almighty as ""includes having more power than any other thing."" This means that God himself is proclaiming that he has unrivaled or at least much more power than anything other thing. When this is the case, it seems to me that a truly Almighty God would have little trouble with a simple rock. However, even if you do not believe this concept, my opponent's concept is flawed as well. As evidenced in Genesis, the first book of the bible, the Christian God is a God of Creation. The Paradox of the Stone asks nothing that would go against the nature of God. In fact, it only asks that he do as he often does and create a stone. He is not being asked to sin or perform an action, which he has not done before. Therefore, my opponent's concept of what God is holds little if any value to this debate. Since, this paradox does nothing to force God against his nature and being that God introduces and proclaims himself as being almighty. With that in mind, my opponent has already agreed that something that is almighty has more power than anything else including a rock. Therefore, if the Christian God does not have all the power he claims to have, he is not the God portrayed by the Bible and Christian Faith and thusly this version of God cannot exist. My opponent also mentioned that if we assume that things that are logically impossible might be possible, then God is not disproved. However, by following this point of view logic and reasoning become pointless. By throwing out logic, we allow any random idea to make since. For example, if we dismiss logic then a person could easily say that because he or she gets up every morning to greet the sun, that his or her greeting causes the sun to rise and without that person getting up every morning the sun would never rise. This statement, seems to me at least, to be utterly ridiculous, however without logic a person could not tell the difference. Furthermore, since, debate is based on this same logic, by throwing the logic out we defeat the purpose of debate. That seems to me to be just as pointless as this idea would make logic. Lastly my opponent stated in his second to last paragraph that there is yet another way to show that we absolutely cannot assume ""omnipotent"" to mean the ability to do the logically impossible. However, my opponent fails to state what this way or method of reasoning is. He only proceeds to say what the impacts of making this assumption would be and how they are beneficial towards his side of the case. Therefore, I would like my opponent to at least state what this alternative way is.

Without answers to such questions, my argument stands: "" What makes the butchering of animals different on a moral basis from the butchering of humans in the eyes of God is unexplained."" My conclusion also stands that the morality in the Bible is completely arbitrary. 2) CON: "" God tells Cain that if he does what is good then he will be accepted just as Abel, but Cain clearly refuses."" How is it clear that Cain does what is evil? There were no commandments regarding murder. There was no guideline from God or anyone else to stipulate what was good and what was evil. Even Adam and Eve were at least told beforehand what exactly constituted Biblical morality - don't eat from the Tree of Knowledge. Cain was not told anything. Keep in mind that Abel killed animals to satiate God, resulting in ""[the firstborn of his flock's] blood [crying] out to [God] from the ground"" (Genesis 4:10)."" Yet for some reason God found this pleasing. This reason is never explained in the Bible. If Abel did what was ""right,"" then what is ""right"" is to destroy a part of God's creation to please God. Cain did the same, he destroyed a part of God's creation by killing Abel...yet this did not please God. Going by this logic, the morality in the Bible is contradictory. 3) CON then uses 1 John 3:12 to support his argument, that "" Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous."" Here we run into the exact same problem. What was evil about Cain's actions? What was righteous about Abel's actions? 1 John 3:12 does not elaborate. Cain did not have the 10 commandments to instruct him on how to act. 4) CON's conclusion is extremely problematic: "" It is divinely instituted that Abel belonged to the righteous bloodline of the Messiah."" This is simply wrong: a) Abel belonged to the bloodline of Adam. It is through Adam that all of mankind is condemned to lead a life of sin. Like Adam, Abel was a sinner. Abel was not righteous, even if he strove for righteousness. Abel did not have any offspring, so it is impossible for Abel to have a bloodline from him. I must add that Cain also strove for righteousness...indeed it is Cain who first conceived of making offerings to God, not Abel, and not Adam or Eve. b) Christ was born via immaculate conception. He was not Joseph's son...he was the Son of God. c) In order for Abel to belong to the bloodline of Christ, Abel must have been born from Christ's offspring. This is an illogical and blasphemous assertion from CON on several levels, as it would require that Christ do what the Nephilim did in Genesis, i.e. procreate with humans, and would require Christ to have impregnated Eve to sire Abel, which is simply not Biblical. 5) The most egregious point against CON's argumentation is his advocacy of predetermination, that ""Cain was destined to commit this murder"" and thereby had no choice in the matter. This goes against most Christian teachings of the necessity of free will to give man a choice to accept and love God. If all of life and existence is predetermined, then it stands that God, who created all of life and existence, created the good AND the evil, and thus caused evil to come into existence. If so, then God is good AND evil and caused Satan to ""fall"" as well. This contradicts Biblical morality, that God is omnibenevolent ( <URL>... ). Conclusion My opponent has made a good number of assertions, but there is no reasonable basis for most of them, and some (such as Abel and Christ being related) are just flat out wrong. The Bible does not explain what is good and evil in the time of Cain and Abel. It does not explain why killing animals is good, while killing people is not good. It does not explain why God did not look upon Cain with favor. It does not explain what is sinful about the act of acquisition, whether it be knowledge or otherwise. Many of CON's arguments highlight various contradictions in Biblical morality, such as 1) an omnibenevolent and omnipotent God creating evil, and that 2) predetermination means that man cannot help but to sin, and God knew this before he created man and thus wished to curse man because it is His will, which again contradicts the omnibenevolence of God.
