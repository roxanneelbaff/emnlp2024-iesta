0,"Counter Arguments 1. Lethality First off I want to point out that something can be harmful without being lethal. While my opponent claims many scorpions are not deadly, they can still be harmful. Now, the resolution states that scorpions in general are good pets, in general being defined in Round One as ""not confined by specialization or limitation"" meaning that we can't say scorpions are good pets for everyone except. Now, scorpion stings are dangerous for young children, the elderly and other pets. While they may not be lethal necessarily, I wouldn't want my child being stung by a scorpion "" if your child is stung, always get immediate medical care"". [1] This shows that if you have a child stung by your pet, you'll need to get immediate medical care. This could turn into a restraint in that many parents won't want scorpions in the house if they have children. They're also dangerous to other pets so if you have a cat or dog you won't want a scorpion around because it could be bad for them same as your child. I would say, scorpions are not good pets in general because they pose a danger to children and pets. 2. Ease of Care Ease of care does not make a pet good. Ants would be easy to take care of but that doesn't mean I want pet ants. This point is a small factor in considering the overall desirability of a pet but is not a main factor. In fact, many pets are easy to take care of. Hamsters, fish, mice etc all have similar requirements for care as scorpions do. This is a small factor easily outweighed by other negative factors about a scorpion. 3. Longevity Cats and dogs are not the most popular pets in America because of their longevity. Hamsters, fish and mice are also on the top 10 list [2] and all of these pets are not long living, in fact many types will die within two years of ownership. Cats and dogs are the most popular because they're common, have roots dating back hundreds of years, are friendly and loyal as well as cute and soft. Cats and dogs have many types and distinct personalities, all of these things rank much higher on the Pros list for cats and dogs than longevity does. A. Most Popular Pets The top 10 most popular pets in America feature many animals that share similar qualities. The number one similar trait between most of the pets on the top ten list is visual appeal. Cats, dogs, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and ferrets all have fur and are generally pleasing to look at. Some are considered ""cute"" others ""fluffy"" but all none of them are truly ugly. Scorpions aren't pleasing to look at, with their hard outer shell and bug-like legs they would not appeal to the majority of pet owners making them not fit the requirement of ""generally"" good pets. The scorpion does not even make it onto the top 10 pets in America list. [2] No other bug or arachnid is on the top ten list and the scorpion does not fit in with the rest of the pets on the list. Many of the pets on the list have personality appeal such as dogs, cats and birds. Others have appeal to children that can cuddle and play with them such as hamsters, dogs and guinea pigs. You can't really play with a scorpion, can't teach it tricks, take it for walks, let your kids cuddle with it, ogle over its cuteness or anything else that pet owners generally enjoy in their pets. * Scorpions are dangerous to children * They're ugly * They don't share qualities that other popular pets in America have * You can't play with, cuddle with, walk, train etc scorpions * Scorpions are not good pets in general In general, the public and majority of pet owners would not find the same appeal in scorpions as they do in other pets.

I am also sorry that I did not exstend my last round to it's greatest and have a hair on edge, spine tiggerling conclusion. Sorry Skeptic. Anyway alway I go. Fossils are also proof for Noah's flood and more so than evolution. No dinosaur could really climb a tree and when the flood struck the earth the creatures that were mostly mamales could climb trees with much more of a attitude compared to dinosaurs. With nible limbs and claws in such to clumb to higher spots, mamales would seem to have evolved last. Where as the dinosaurs were not agile but were fast runners and also fairly show. Take a look at the Carnotaurus, it has short arms, stronge muscular legs, grew 9m long and 3m tall, not really suitable for climbing at all. To climb anything really, a creature needs to be taller than it is longer. A cat, when standing on its back legs is just that alike with most other mamales such as dogs, bears etc... Birds can simply fly. Now you maybe wondering why some lizards which according to evolution lived around 300 million years ago? The young could climb very well up trees, away from their parents which would eat them, so why did they die in the flood? Well maybe they didn't, the Komodo dragon is very similiar, and its young once hatched climbs and even lives up in the tree tops. And once when they are large enough the lizards will return to solid ground. You did not reply that well back to my bones analogy, in that it make complete sense (some spelling) yet you did not have even a decent come back. Alot of your science is based on possibilities and probabilites, not definite facts or any believable science. And neither am I, however I take creation as a belief where as you take it as scientific. You bluntly commented back to why my philosophy on bones did not work out, I can see it understandably logical, it makes sense that if one bones is a type of creature with in a kind and one fossil is another kind that must result in a different kind from another in real life plays role as another planet. With extraterrestral life of some sort. All alien means is, foreign, from another country or land, planet or universe, whatever. The analogy works, you now need to prove alien life on another planet to suggest all the creatures on earth a related. Therefore making fossils a proven fact that evolution occurs. Unfortunately since this is the last round, you may have to reply in the comment section. I for one do not believe in alien life. In that there is intelligent beings. Since there will be no way to get any signals from unadvased organisms like kittens and puppies, the chance you will prove evolution is very, very slim. The nearest star to our sun is thought to be 5 light years away. I have talked about why carbon and radiomatric methods are untrustworthy (look back to round one, my round) Pro did not reply when I found that scientists who were evolutionists carbon dated dinosaur fossils to find out they were only 1000's of years old. So the scientists scrapped the results. - Still no word from that? I never suggested or thought that the whole feild of science is invalid in the slightest. I will not be obvious and state that I think evolution is not science. Science needs to be tested (micro evolution has) evolution has not been, that being the over millions of years evolution, were it is far too slow to really witness. You base what you find such as fossils and then you plant an imagenation around the facts to support a perfect world to be allow to commit sin in. ""You have failed to give me the links for the inaccurate dating"" - I do not take notice of dating methods, only when dating methods go wrong, then I use that as proof for dating methods to be untrustworthy. Here is a link so that you can see what I am speak of. <URL>... So for example, if a scientist predicts an age for a fossil by how deep it is in the dirt, then returns it back to the lab for anaylsis. Say the fossil was prosumed to be 27 million years old, and the dating method tell the scientist the fossil is actually 9 thousand years old. Who do you trust? The scientist or the dating method? So I ignore them both and turn to the Bible where it says, in Romans 1:25, ""The thruth of God will be exchanged for a lie, where people will start to worship the creatures and not the creator. The Bibel also states to turn away from what man says about the truth. You should flee, as in run and not look back, from lies and sin. Conclusion: Good debate, thank you. Evermore you failed to bring forth proof of any valid reasons but only mere suggestions in why I as a individual should believe and take evolution as science because there are fossils in the ground. Fossils (Like I said eariler) point more towards Noah's flood rather than evolution, that it makes much more sense that the less nible creature drownd first as they could not reach high ground. And small mamales which have been known to live amung dinosaurs simply drownd based purely on their size.

It is somewhat lengthy, but it is very well informed, also note that it was meant for Christians to read so you will have to read it from that standpoint. As I have left my opponent with very little to discus I will add more topics: Noah's flood. If you look throughout the world almost all cultures have a ""Flood Story"". The strangest thing about this is that some of these cultures have either very little or no similarities besides that. Here is one of the stories taken from Babylon: Once, the gods were angry with men, and they decided to destroy them in a great flood. They warned one good man, Ut-napishtim, to build a boat. The flood came and everything was destroyed except Ut-napishtim's boat, which came to rest on a mountain. He sent birds out, but they could find nowhere to settle. Finally a raven was sent out and it did not return. The earth was beginning to dry out. Ut-napishtim and his family gave thanks for having been saved. This story is almost identical to the Bible's version, aside from the names and specifics if you replace gods with God and Ut-napishtim with Noah it is a shortened out version of the Bible's. The other evidence is that shells have been found as high as Mt. Everest and Mt. St Helen which means that a worldwide flood to even skeptical scientists seems very probable, yet another thing that supports the flood is the Millions of fossils buried in random places, all over the world. Now in order to make a fossil you need a few very specific things: First you need mud, and very quickly you need it to be submerged in an area were the flesh will decay but the bones will be ""mummified"" so to speak. A massive flood is perfect for this so it is a good explanation for the fossils all over the world. Also a big question is ""How did humanity or anything survive?"" well in the bible it clearly states that God told Noah to build an ark and that the ark would have to of each type of animal in it [there were exceptions for various types of animals such as the sheep], but when I ""each type"" I specifically mean ""each type"" as in their would only be one type of dog, one type of cat, one type of big cat, one type of elephant and so on.

I thank my opponent for a timely response.  
  
-The Ship  
  
My opponent suggests that,  
""Con has left out a more plausible option for the ship. A small vessel that only holds a few beings in it, the sleeper idea would be plausible for this type of ship. This small vessel would be likely because it would not take the huge amount of resources that would be required for a generation ship. A small vessel would also, most likely, not be a warship designed for invasion.""  
  
The aliens are unlikely to utilise a single small sleeper vessel, they would naturally have sought to send a sufficient population for both genetic variability and to ensure the survival of a new colony. In any event it is likely that vessels sleeper technology would still require energy and/or sustenance. In any event a small sleeper vessel unsuited for war would not after a journey that may have lasted millions of years approach an inhabited and potentially hostile world.

8,"I thank my opponent for this very interesting debate on a controversial scenario. After reading through my opponent's arguments a few times, I found what I thought was the resolution which was: Resolution: Homos [Floresienses] who rape underage girls should not stand trial because they cannot be held liable for their actions, nor are they be capable of defending themselves, in the same way as modern humans are, and therefore, any trial would be unfair. My opponent gives three reasons to support the resolution. Here are my rebuttals: 1) Cannot be held liable for their actions My opponent does not give any reason why Homo Floros cannot be held liable for their actions. Raping a member of any species is wrong and the offender must be held liable by the species which the offender raped. If any species rapes a human, then they must face the human justice system. In the late 1300s, a bull was convicted for killing a five year old boy [1]. A French donkey was accused of savagely attacking a farmer, but was acquited when the farmer testified that the donkey was usually gentle [1]. When a pig killed an infant child by eating its arm and face, it was locked up with human defendents, convicted, and had its own arm and face cut off as a punishment [1]. I assume that it was later turned into a sausage and eaten. If pigs, bulls, and donkeys are held responsible for their actions by humans, so too should the Homo Floro. All animals have their own justice system. Bears don't usually attack humans but when a bear cub is taken, mama bear will bite [4]. Humans must protect themselves the same way. Homo Floros must be treated with respect, but when a Homo Floro rapes a human, humans must put that rapist in jail. 2) Not capable of defending themselves This is not accurate as Homo Floros are perfectly capable of defending themselves. They were advanced people who used fire for cooking [5]. They could certainly use fire in war. They also manufacturing sophisticated stone tools and hunted pygmy elephants [5]. Either way, their ability to defend themselves must not outweigh the fact that they committed an act of violence upon a Homo Sapiens. Homo Sapiens therefore must adequately dispense justice. 3) They might have intercourse with a young girl thinking that she was a sexually mature female Homo Floresiences This is extremely unlikely. Source [2] shows a female Homo Floro while source [3] shows a human girl. Upon opening both sources side by side, it can be seen that the two females look nothing like each other. The only similarity is their size. More specifically, the human girl is clothed and far less hairy than the female Homo Floro. The two also have hair on different parts of their body. While the Homo Floro has hair on her face and upper arms, the human girl only has hair on top of her head. These are few of the many differences. The only similarity is the size. I ask my opponent: Do male monkeys mistake human girls for monkeys and attempt to have sexual intercourse with them despite being the same size?

9,"Lethality vs. Harmful I already conceded that scorpions are largely not lethal. The crux of my argument comes from the fact that scorpion stings are dangerous, painful and require a hostpital visit if they happen to small children or elderly people. Just as red ants aren't lethal, you wouldn't want your child playing with red ants because their bites are painful. Something can be harmful without being lethal. I have already shown with a reputable source (The Mayo Clinic) that if small children are stung you need to seek medical treatment. While pet scorpions may not be lethal, not only is the possibility of being lethal there, they have a sting that is harmful to three very distinct groups of people pointed out by the Mayo Clinic. Elderly Children Pets Their venom can cause shock in some victims and there is a population of those allergic to scoprion venom much like bee venom. [1] They are not safe pets. All I'm saying, is that the general public might not want to have a scorpion as a pet because of these warnings of potential harm to distinct groups of people which would eliminate the ""general"" clause of the resolution when it comes to scorpions as pets. Ease of Care The point I was trying to make with the ease of care remark was that most common pets (cats, dogs, hamsters, fish etc) are all realatively easy to take care of. Ease of care in a scorpion does not set it above other pets which are also easy to care for. Also, scorpions are not as easy to care for as my opponent makes out. They require strict habitat control with temperatures near 100 degrees at all times (via heat lamp) and a strict humidity level to keep them happy or else you'll have problems. ""[T]he habitat should be maintained at a high humidity level by regular (daily) misting. The substrate should be kept damp, but not wet. If there is mold on the substrate or condensation on the walls of the tank, the humidity is too high."" [1] That seems pretty picky for a pet ""easy to take care of"". You have to mist the cage, keep the humidity to a correct level. That sounds more intensive that dropping a few crickets in now and again. Longevity You compared scorpions to popular pets (cats and dogs) and used longevity as the common denominator. Therefore you were insisting that longevity is what made cats and dogs popular which would make scorpions popular as well. However, I was saying that longevity is not necessarily an important factor for some people and for others longevity is a deal breaker. Each pet owner is different. Some want long living pets, others want short 1-2 year pets. Either way, longevity alienates short life pet fans again making them fit a specific market and not ""general"" pet owners. Most Popular Pets My opponent forgets that I did not make these assumptions about beauty and personality appeal from the top of my head. I derived it from the top ten list of most popular pets in the US and came up with them using common factors between the ten of them. My observations about the appearence is derived from 10 popular sources. All of which have common factors. All of these things were derived from data. The resolution driving this debate is whether or not scorpions are good pets in general. In general meaning they have to appeal to everyone or just about everyone. While some things are indeed subjective, I was trying to find common traits that are accepted by the general majority and in doing so have shown they do not coincide with the likes and wants of the general public. Sure, scorpions can be a good pet for a small group, an individual, a niche but the debate calls for the defense of scorpions as good pets for the general public. As for the other points: - Watching your scorpion eat might be cool once, twice maybe even three times but more than that? Probably not. Things get old eventually. - It's interesting because it's not general. Scorpions are uncommon for a reason. - Like the eating thing, watching them burrow and climb will only be interesting for so long. - A general pet should not require gloves to operate. As for the cuteness of scorpions, you yourself said it's subjective. I pointed out that the things that make a scorpion cute would not go over well in general. Also, they would turn off people who are afraid of insects or spiders. There are those out there (quite a few actually) who are afraid of anything small with more than four legs. This crowd would be completely shut out from the scorpion pet crew. They wouldn't be able to handle one. Because if you really look at it simply, a scorpion is merely a bug. Scorpions are not good pets in general. They exclude too many groups of people such as overprotective mothers, people who find fuzzy pets cute, those who are afraid of insects or spiders, those who want a short term pet.

My opponent concedes that the person of Jesus Christ fully constitutes God, in that proof of the Father and the Holy Spirit is unnecessary. However, he claims that I must prove Jesus' omnipotence, omniscience and omnibenevolence. This is not necessary. Christianity is, shall we say...not entirely consistent. Though Christ is attested to constitute God in His entirety, he is not granted the omnipotence and omniscience of God.  
  
Arguments:  
1. The Father created the cosmos, as well as man, and subsequently created Jesus. [3]  
2. Jesus was never credited with omniscience.

I would like to correct my opponent by telling him that macro/micro evolution are not different theories but simply different parts of evolution. My opponent is of the stance that microevolution occurs, but macroevolution does not. The key difference between these is whether evolution can result in speciation. All speciation is is when mutations cause one breed to no longer reproduce with another, making them separate species. *No Sir, I am correcting YOU. Piggy-backing a lie (macro evolution) onto a truth (micro evolution) and then calling it one theory will not hold water without an example... I will provide a known example of speciation, but I would first like to point out the obvious logical flaw with suggesting that no species can split into 2 different species. This would be suggesting that the different species in the world are not genetically related whatsoever. *You have NOT provided a known example! Similarities between species suggest a common designer NOT common ancestry.. Ford automobiles all look kind of similar.. same designer! This is quite ridiculous, of course, considering how similar many different species are. For instance, chimpanzees and humans (which aren't even in the same genus) only have a 1.2% difference in genes. My opponent seems to be suggesting that this almost identical genome is the result of pure coincidence? That is ridiculous, logically that information would imply that humans and chimpanzees have a common ancestor, and that somewhere along the way, their lineages were divided into 2 different species. *See above answer! My opponent seems to have another misconception about evolution which I would like to point out. He defined macroevolution as suggesting ""that species may change from one species to another species"". That is not a description of evolution. Evolution is not so much a change from one species to another, but more the branching off into another species. basically, if one lineage evolves into a new species, their cousins to not vanish. *If your seriously suggesting that we started out as amoeba then something somewhere had to change species.. a lot! And likewise, in the instance of microevolution, the whole species does not necessarily change, but certain individuals may be present that have a mutation that others don't. And if that lineage of slightly different individuals can get more and more variation, it is only logical that they, after a while, may not be able to reproduce with others. This is especially true when a species is suddenly divided geographically and then undergo microevolution independently of each other. The chance that they would both happen to evolve exactly the same way if they are in different environments and divided so they can't reproduce, is negligible at best. Therefore, speciation definitely occurs in nature. *Example? Now, my opponent has also made the illogical statement that beneficial mutations never occur. This is a clear contradiction to his earlier statement that micro-evolution takes place. How can my opponent believe that microevolution takes place, yet not believe that beneficial mutations occur? The only answer I can think of is that he has some sort of misunderstanding of what evolution is or a misunderstanding of what mutations are. *Again, the misunderstanding is yours Sir. Because you start from the belief that everything is improving and becoming more complex etc then you naturally assume that mutation is beneficial. BUT everything is certainly not improving, everything is winding down, becoming weaker, smaller, more disease prone. In this sense mutations and variations (that are ALREADY within the gene pool) while not improving the species may help it adapt to new conditions etc. EXAMPLE!!! There is a type of cave salamander (lizard) that has lost the use of it's eyes completely as it now lives exclusively in dark caves, there is an identical salamander that has eyes.. This mutation may help enhance the other senses but in NO way could it be described as beneficial to the species as a whole. There has been NO increase in genetic complexity. An increase in genetic complexity is absolutely CRUCIAL for macro evolution to occur. A species cannot ""adapt according to surroundings"" (which you have claimed occurs) if they cannot mutate beneficially. The ""adaptations"" are merely the mutations that were beneficial enough to not get the individual killed. Positive change cannot occur without beneficial mutations. So which is it? Microevolution or no good mutations? It can't be both. *Mutations DO get them killed! do you know HOW many species have become extinct? And even so, how could organisms reach their complex and efficient state they are at now without positive mutations? How could they change from extremely simple particles to large, perfectly-adapted organisms such as sharks? I don't know how you would suggest that would happen without a long series of occasional benign mutations. *They were created perfect.. since then things have deteriorated.. Fossil records clearly show that everything was much bigger and better back in the day!

32,"Since this is the last round,i would like to thank Con for participating in this debate. It was fun and interesting. It's also interesting to see Con has made false assumptions and mistakes AGAIN. Just to correct you,where you said ""So Con's analogy does accomplish nothing"" You probably meant Pro,just to clarify that. Con did nothing to disprove my arguments,let's take a look. First of all,Con used Newton's quote in attempt to bolster his claim. This was argument from authority fallacy. While Newton did a great job at explaining laws of motion and ""discovering gravity"" (for what he is famous,needless to say),he also believed in alchemy. Newton's quote doesn't prove/disprove anything. If Newton knew about evolution/abiogenesis theories and the evidence for them at that time (which did not exist at the time), i doubt that he would make the same quote. Next i recap that we have experimented with amino-accids,proteins,RNA and DNA. A research has been done that i think Con and our audience should check out [1] The Christian view requires fewer assumptions? Yes,but not in the world of science,not in the world of rationalism. It is extremely easy to believe that God created everything. Hmm that seems possible,since science can't explain many things. Well science has refuted many creationist claims that God is necessary. People believed that the world is flat,people believed that bird blood can cure leprosy,people believed that the Earth is the center of the universe,people believed that Earth was made 6000 years ago,...just to name a few. We have proven that Earth is older than 6000 years old using radiometric dating. And every type of RMD indicates,when a sample is examined, that the Earth is older than 6000 years. All the creationist beliefs are based on a single book. ""But evolutionists prefer abiogenesis simply because it avoids God."" Wrong! A typical straw man. Evolutionists/scientists prefer abiogenesis because there are thousands of evidence supporting it (most of those are about evolution as well),in contrary to creationism,which has,if not 0,then minuscule amount of evidence for reality,and those are just a few simple things we know today,and people knew then when using their brains. And many ""abiogenesis believers"" do believe in a God. These are known as deists. Although they don't believe in a God resembling anything like a Christian God. We went away from the topic way more than i expected. Although i had to answer these arguments,if you can call them that. I never said probability is meaningless about determining the chances about the past. I said that it's meaningless when explaining the impossibility of something in the past. And this is only for things that we have evidence for happened. ""We can conclude, based on probability, that some things definitely never happened (like abiogenesis). And, as I pointed out, if our view of history requires something impossible to happen, it is probably wrong."" Did you ignore my proofs in the last two rounds? Abiogenesis is NOT IMPOSSIBLE,i have proven this. I have also linked my source [1] for you to check out. ""The reason evolutionists believe in the abiogenesis hypothesis is because excluding God, it's their only hope of explaining our life-filled world. Unfortunately, abiogenesis is, practically, impossible, which means that abiogenesis should remain a hypothesis and a failed one at that."" *facepalm* Again, a straw man. And i am not going to repeat myself again for the second sentence. I said,and i repeat,that a chance of a raindrop hitting your nose is definite. Let's take your version of the analogy. I want to pick a grain of sand. What is the chance that i will pick a grain of sand? The answer is: definite. But now as i am walking away,i ask myself: ""What was the chance that i would have picked this particular grain of sand""? And the answer is 1:30.000.000 (taking your chance). The question ""What is the chance that i WILL pick a particular grain of sand"" is another story. You can't choose a particular grain of sand for the future,you can just describe it. Like: What is the chance that i will pick a cube-shaped grain of sand at random? Then 1:30.000.000 becomes applicable. If asking about the past: ""What was the chance that i would have picked this particular grain of sand""? the answer is 1:30.000.000 again,but it already happened,we have proof that it happened,we are holding that grain of sand in our hands. [Caps lock] THIS IS WHY THE PROBABILITY ARGUMENT FAILS WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE PAST. IT IS MEANINGLESS WHEN TRYING TO PROVE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING HAPPENING IN THE PAST,OF WHICH WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE FOR. Now Con's only counter-argument would be that the proofs for abiogenesis don't exist. But i would beg to differ. That is a discussion for another time. ""Information does not come from chaos."" This is a really vague claim open to equivocation. If you meant ""Order does not come from chaos"" or ""Order does not come from disorder"" I will disagree with you. First answer: It depends on what we perceive as ""order"" and ""chaos"". We might be living in a chaotic state,but we perceive it as order.. This is a more philosophical question. Second answer is about 2nd law of thermodynamics [2] (which you might have been referring to). This article contains some extra information about creationism too. So to recap what we have concluded: 1. We have concluded that nothing in our physical world is impossible as long as it doesn't break any laws of physics. 2. We don't need probabilities to help us determine the chances of something happening in the past (impossibility), since it does nothing to disprove that something. 3. Once we've established the 2nd premise, we can conclude that abiogenesis is both mathematically and practically possible,since it doesn't break any laws of nature. (plus we have done multiple experiments to prove it) Conclusion: Probability argument falls flat when used to disprove the possibility of abiogenesis.

33,"Thank you for the answer, Con. Now i shall proceed with a rebuttal. Con admitted that given enough time, one could theoretically hit a certain point on a dartboard. Now that that is settled,let's see what Con presented. ""Pro erred concerning the area of points on the tip of the dart. There are a an infinite number of points there as well."" True,there are infinite number of points on the tip of the arrow (i prefer to call it arrow). But i was talking about the measurable area that hits the dartboard. That area is NOT a mathematical point,once again. If we were to look at it like Con did,the infinite number of points on the arrow will hit the infinite number of points on the fraction of the dartboard. In this case we have two infinites to deal with and we cannot make any proportion with just infinites. 1/infinity is undefined as infinity is not a number. But we know that if a number we are dividing with approaches infinity (in 1/x , x->infinity) then the product number is approaching 0. If the number is extremely small,we can start treating it as 0,but it is not the actual 0. So if you choose an AREA on the dartboard (that is the area of the tip of the arrow or bigger,say 2cm^2) Then chances are, of course bigger than 1/x , x->infinity,because x in this case does not go towards infinity,but is a finite number. I used the example with mathematical points to explain that the concept of infinity is meaningless to the argument,therefore proving that the chances of something happening are greater than 0. Of course that something had to happen within the constant laws of physics. In this case it's the past. We have enough proof of amino-acids combining to form proteins (we depend on that),and we have been able to prove that it is possible and even project it and see what could have happened. Just like if we choose an area of the dart so small that we have 10^67 chance to hit, given the time of 100 billion years. Though this is only the chance of that happening, it does not mean that it has to happen in the exact 100 billion years. We can hit that small area that we have 1 in 10^67 chance in one try. It is possible. It is also possible that proteins necessary for life can form in 1 billion years and less. We are not breaking any laws here. By this i proved that Con's claim that my analogy accomplishes nothing is false. I do not understand this from Con,i beg him to explain this sentence to me: ""The probability for life coming about, on the other hand, is the dartboard equivelant to the probability for making a bull's eye once during one's entire life."" Moving on: Occam's razor doesn't always mean that a solution with fewest assumptions is true. Con's Columbus analogy assumes that a law must be broke in order of something being achieved,that is, the law needs to be broke for that something to be achieved. It is possible and practical that someone altered the sources and did that unscathed. The example is with Hitler, sources tell that he shot himself in the bunker,but i read the news earlier this year on a popular website and in the newspaper that Hitler was alive,living in South America for 20-ish more years or so after the war. Though this is quite arbitrary,it is theoretically possible and ""practical"",since no one else saw Hitler's body besides a few dozen of his generals,before being thrown in a hole and lit on fire,so the allies wouldn't find/identify the body. And he was known for having an identical double. Now let the assumptions fly all over the place. ""Ahem. Probability is the chance something will happen in the future. We are taking the pre-life view on earth for the purposes of this discussion. We can't calculate the probability of an event that's already happened. It's over. However, we can calculate the possibility that a view of history is correct. Pro could be arguing here that life did arise from non-life, and that therefore the event of abiogenesis occuring was obviously possible. However, that argument falls flat also. Why? Because abiogenesis was not recorded historically, and there is no evidence for it."" So if probability is the chance something will happen in the future, then it means that probability is not meant for explaining the past. Well that is the point. Probability argument fails when it comes to explaining the past,it's meaningless! The evidence for abiogenesis is not relevant to this debate. And also scientists propose multiple number of hypotheses and then test them. The ones that pass the test become theories. So far we have a lot of evidence that life came from non-life during a series of chemical reactions. Now how exactly it came,scientists are still not sure,but as science progresses, we will eventually have the answer. Since this is not relevant to the debate,i will not go into detail here. For the raindrop analogy...Yes the chances of a raindrop to hit your nose is definite. But a chance raindrop that did hit your nose in the past,to actually hit your nose is 1 in 10^58 as i calculated. We are talking about that particular raindrop. See what is happening here? For your closing example you are looking at the Rushmore mountain faces as an uninformed person and assume that they formed naturally. However it's not just the calculating you have to do,as you already know. You have to do a research,collect the evidence and then form a theory. This is what scientists did. The theory of abiogenesis from non-life is a valid theory. You falsely assume in your final example that scientists are uninformed about the topic under discussion and research. That is all from me, can't wait to hear Con's rebuttal. Good luck!",1,chewster911,"

So if you choose an AREA on the dartboard (that is the area of the tip of the arrow or bigger,say 2cm^2) Then chances are, of course bigger than 1/x , x->infinity,because x in this case does not go towards infinity,but is a finite number. I used the example with mathematical points to explain that the concept of infinity is meaningless to the argument,therefore proving that the chances of something happening are greater than 0. Of course that something had to happen within the constant laws of physics. In this case it's the past.  
  
We have enough proof of amino-acids combining to form proteins (we depend on that),and we have been able to prove that it is possible and even project it and see what could have happened. Just like if we choose an area of the dart so small that we have 10^67 chance to hit, given the time of 100 billion years. Though this is only the chance of that happening, it does not mean that it has to happen in the exact 100 billion years. We can hit that small area that we have 1 in 10^67 chance in one try. It is possible. It is also possible that proteins necessary for life can form in 1 billion years and less. We are not breaking any laws here.  
  
By this i proved that Con's claim that my analogy accomplishes nothing is false.  
  
I do not understand this from Con,i beg him to explain this sentence to me:  
  
""The probability for life coming about, on the other hand, is the dartboard equivelant to the probability for making a bull's eye once during one's entire life.""  
  
Moving on: Occam's razor doesn't always mean that a solution with fewest assumptions is true.  
Con's Columbus analogy assumes that a law must be broke in order of something being achieved,that is, the law needs to be broke for that something to be achieved. It is possible and practical that someone altered the sources and did that unscathed. The example is with Hitler, sources tell that he shot himself in the bunker,but i read the news earlier this year on a popular website and in the newspaper that Hitler was alive,living in South America for 20-ish more years or so after the war. Though this is quite arbitrary,it is theoretically possible and ""practical"",since no one else saw Hitler's body besides a few dozen of his generals,before being thrown in a hole and lit on fire,so the allies wouldn't find/identify the body. And he was known for having an identical double. Now let the assumptions fly all over the place.  
  
""Ahem. Probability is the chance something will happen in the future. We are taking the pre-life view on earth for the purposes of this discussion. We can't calculate the probability of an event that's already happened. It's over. However, we can calculate the possibility that a view of history is correct. Pro could be arguing here that life did arise from non-life, and that therefore the event of abiogenesis occuring was obviously possible. However, that argument falls flat also. Why? Because abiogenesis was not recorded historically, and there is no evidence for it.""  
  
So if probability is the chance something will happen in the future, then it means that probability is not meant for explaining the past. Well that is the point. Probability argument fails when it comes to explaining the past,it's meaningless!  
  
The evidence for abiogenesis is not relevant to this debate. And also scientists propose multiple number of hypotheses and then test them. The ones that pass the test become theories. So far we have a lot of evidence that life came from non-life during a series of chemical reactions. Now how exactly it came,scientists are still not sure,but as science progresses, we will eventually have the answer. Since this is not relevant to the debate,i will not go into detail here.  
  
For the raindrop analogy...Yes the chances of a raindrop to hit your nose is definite. But a chance raindrop that did hit your nose in the past,to actually hit your nose is 1 in 10^58 as i calculated. We are talking about that particular raindrop. See what is happening here?  
  
For your closing example you are looking at the Rushmore mountain faces as an uninformed person and assume that they formed naturally. However it's not just the calculating you have to do,as you already know. You have to do a research,collect the evidence and then form a theory. This is what scientists did. The theory of abiogenesis from non-life is a valid theory. You falsely assume in your final example that scientists are uninformed about the topic under discussion and research.  
  
That is all from me, can't wait to hear Con's rebuttal. Good luck!",Science,2,The-probability-argument-falls-flat-when-it-comes-to-explaining-the-past/1/,43805

Due to the fact that there is no one around to hear it, it does not exist."" No it's not. Detection is a matter of human perspective. Detection is when a person or something hears or senses the sound. Just because that does not happen, does not mean that the sound was not created. WHen people try to say that just because someone wasn't there, a sound wasn't created, it is completely beside the point! What difference would it make if someone was there? It would be detected. Either way, a sound is produced. Also, now this may defy my thesis, but of course in a forest, there are small bugs and insects and animals. The small insects don't make an impact on the sound being created. They are there to detect it. In any forest (refer to definiton) there are little bugs and animals.

Detection and creation of sound is scientifical, and is not logic. Those two points do not really even relate to eachother! ""However, if there is nobody around to feel the vibrations, they never occured as stated by the Smithsonian INstitute on December 12,2008."" Okay, while this may be true, in a forest, things are there. The vibrations will occur and will be felt by the ground, other plants, and little creatures that reside in the forest. As to my sources, my sources are pure science. Ask any science professor or teacher. They will fully support my case. I haven't presented any facts that require a source other than just science.

""nowhere in your does it state, scientifically speaking""  
It doesn't need to. A sound is created, whether or not the sound is heard is beyond the point. The point is, a sound is created. Scienficially speaking doesn't need to be included, because a sound is created no matter what...  
  
""Therefore it is all a matter of human perspective. Due to the fact that there is no one around to hear it, it does not exist.""  
No it's not. Detection is a matter of human perspective. Detection is when a person or something hears or senses the sound. Just because that does not happen, does not mean that the sound was not created. WHen people try to say that just because someone wasn't there, a sound wasn't created, it is completely beside the point! What difference would it make if someone was there? It would be detected. Either way, a sound is produced. Also, now this may defy my thesis, but of course in a forest, there are small bugs and insects and animals. The small insects don't make an impact on the sound being created. They are there to detect it. In any forest (refer to definiton) there are little bugs and animals.
