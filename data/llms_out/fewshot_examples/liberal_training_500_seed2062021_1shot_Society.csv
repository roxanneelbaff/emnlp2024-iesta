0,"Thank you for accepting the challenge I look forward to the debate. What my opponent says regarding the reason for the high price of marijuana is only partially true. Price of Marijuana world wide is relatively high even where there is an acceptance of the drug such as Amsterdam. You claim that I have an ignorance of the dynamics of economics because I do not understand basic supply and demand concepts however you contradict yourself by saying that large conglomerates would eventually take over production. You also state that the reason cigarettes are of such a low cost yet able to turn a profit is due in part to the addictive quality of nicotine and marijuana does not, which I would completely agree. This in itself is an ignorance of a basic market principle, you have to create a profit. You also make the assumption that mass production of marijuana would generate the same good quality bud that smaller operations generate and this is completely false. As seen with any commodity it takes added time and care to generate high quality product. The brewers are known for this as well as those who produce cigars and cigarettes yet there is still a market for smaller companies who produce smaller quantity but higher quality and therefore more expensive goods. (examples: Flying Dog Beer, Crown Royal, Cohiba) While it is true that the production of paper products and textiles do not support my premise of small business I use only as a means to illustrate my point that hemp is a highly profitable untapped tax source. You do make a compelling point in that because of the low barrier to entry this would create a higher supply and lower demand thus lowering the price. While this may seem very accurate the low cost of actual growth still makes profit margin high enough to be profitable and since maintaining a small amount of plants requires less effort than growing on a larger scale (more than 25 plants) the entrepreneur can maintain another job and tend to his crop when he returns and thus putting more money in his pocket and more money into the tax system when he spends it. Others in the community who do not possess the knowledge or desire to begin growing and would rather purchase would remain high. I failed to mention in my opening state the requirement to be licensed (as is with alcohol). This was alluded when I spoke of the regulation but I failed to clarify what that meant. Obtaining a licence for distribution and sale would increase those barriers to entry and there by increase the demand offsetting the other factors that would increase supply. Just as with beer and liquor production (that can be done in any home with relatively little effort) creation for personal use would be totally acceptable but distribution and transporting over state lines would remain illegal without proper licensing just as with the aforementioned commodities. I also failed to mention that while selling for smoking is one way to consume marijuana the endless supply of baked goods would be a niche that those with the culinary skills could take advantage of. I know my opponent will again assume that corporations such as Toll House and Nabisco would diminish the return by competitive pricing but the evidence puts this argument at a disadvantage. They would no doubt exploit the opportunity but delicious specialty foods are still being made by the local baker. Though it may be more convenient to buy the prepackaged cookies and snacks from the grocer aisle people still purchase better quality food from the baker and he survives and even turns a profit. We even have specialty ""gourmet"" dog restaurants which would have seemed silly only 20 years ago. The point is that people have tastes and those tastes translate to profit. Why would someone spend 4 times more for Hydro when they could easily obtain regs for cheaper and in more abundant supply? Because it tastes better, doesn't make you as sleepy and heightens your senses more. It is a matter of personal taste. Budweiser would not be trying out new flavors of beer (at a higher cost to consumer than regular Bud) if not for the community of microbrewers who have significant enough market share to drive this upward competion. Certainly Budweiser could sell only Budweiser and Bud Light as well as lower quality and lower priced Busch and Natural Light but they do not want to lose any ground because demand is high for something new. And if people are willing to spend more for a quality product than they will explore that option. This does not mean that the competition from the microbrews dissipate as they are still around and doing well. Those that do not profit, drop out of the business and that is the natural selection process of the economy. Complete deregulation of anything, as we see it now in our economy with the banking collapse, leads to chaos in the marketplace, yet that is not what I am proposing. Everything needs to be carefully considered before making a decision as big as this and approached in a businesslike manner. By regulating it with amount limits grown for personal use and by locations where you could consume (hash bars, your home) you maintain a level of balance that is important in the market. I hope this overturns the claim that I am somehow 'ignorant' of basic economics 101 and would ask my opponent to not be as divisive in language until he understands my points clearer or uses more specific examples to illustrate my 'ignorance.'

11,"My argument is not about men using DNA to justify controlling a woman's body. It's about requiring women to live up to their responsibility in the situation the same way men are expected. When a man has sex with a woman he is expected to provide her support (financial, emotional, physical etc.) should conception occur. When she has sex with him she is accepting the same level of responsibility to him that he is accepting to her. If you don't believe that she has any responsibility to him, then how can you argue that he would have responsibility to her? It makes no sense. It's not as though she got pregnant on her own and some strange man is coming along trying to control what she does with her body. The fundamental differences I see between your position and mine: 1. You believe that there is no child after conception. I disagree and there are millions of other people who think the same way. 2. You believe it's all about the woman and there are no other people involved in the situation. The fact of the matter is that she is not alone in the situation. There's another person involved. A person she chose to accept into her life in this way. Perhaps if more women were encouraged to believe this they might feel less alone? 3. You believe in the double standard so often held against men. That belief is that men are only considered to be the father when it's convenient. Fathers are only looked to when they are needed to provide something. The father as another person in the situation with a heart and conscience of his own is of no importance to you whatsoever. >>>>> Tatarize: Nobody has rights to children, whether born or unborn. Then why all the custody battles after birth? If no one has rights to a child then there would be no such thing as custody. And remember, I believe there is a child after conception therefore the child being unborn is irrelevant. >>>>> Tatarize: You actually seems a bit misogynistic. I find your suggestion that I have a dislike for women to be offensive. I'm not degrading women, I'm merely providing a voice for fathers which all too often goes unheard. >>>>> Tatarize: He probably won't win. But, he can sue. If legislation were to pass granting fathers a say in abortion, then he would win. I asked you, >>Is the role of the father merely that of sperm donor? Yes or No? You said: No. But, sperm nor DNA give him the right to control other people. The fact that you added the word ""but"" further points out that you're in favor of a double standard. SUMMARY First, this is the last round of this debate and I want to Thank You for having this conversation with me. I'll look forward to reading your final post and seeing what others on this site have to say on this issue. Suffice to say, you and I will part ways disagreeing (which is okay) The only way I can sum up my point of view on this matter is to remind you that when a woman finds herself pregnant, she didn't get there by herself. She's not alone. Should a woman find herself pregnant by a man who is willing to assist her in all the ways she needs and who would love the baby, is morally wrong on her part. This to me is more vile and immoral than asking her to carry a baby in her womb for nine months.",1,David090,"
  
My argument is not about men using DNA to justify controlling a woman's body. It's about requiring women to live up to their responsibility in the situation the same way men are expected.  
  
When a man has sex with a woman he is expected to provide her support (financial, emotional, physical etc.) should conception occur.  
  
When she has sex with him she is accepting the same level of responsibility to him that he is accepting to her. If you don't believe that she has any responsibility to him, then how can you argue that he would have responsibility to her? It makes no sense. It's not as though she got pregnant on her own and some strange man is coming along trying to control what she does with her body.  
  
The fundamental differences I see between your position and mine:  
  
1. You believe that there is no child after conception. I disagree and there are millions of other people who think the same way.  
  
2. You believe it's all about the woman and there are no other people involved in the situation. The fact of the matter is that she is not alone in the situation. There's another person involved. A person she chose to accept into her life in this way.  
  
Perhaps if more women were encouraged to believe this they might feel less alone?  
  
3. You believe in the double standard so often held against men. That belief is that men are only considered to be the father when it's convenient. Fathers are only looked to when they are needed to provide something. The father as another person in the situation with a heart and conscience of his own is of no importance to you whatsoever.  
  
>>>>> Tatarize: Nobody has rights to children, whether born or unborn.  
  
Then why all the custody battles after birth? If no one has rights to a child then there would be no such thing as custody. And remember, I believe there is a child after conception therefore the child being unborn is irrelevant.  
  
>>>>> Tatarize: You actually seems a bit misogynistic.  
  
I find your suggestion that I have a dislike for women to be offensive. I'm not degrading women, I'm merely providing a voice for fathers which all too often goes unheard.  
  
>>>>> Tatarize: He probably won't win. But, he can sue.  
  
If legislation were to pass granting fathers a say in abortion, then he would win.  
  
I asked you, >>Is the role of the father merely that of sperm donor? Yes or No?  
  
You said: No. But, sperm nor DNA give him the right to control other people.  
  
The fact that you added the word ""but"" further points out that you're in favor of a double standard.

A case study would be in the US, there over 1,100 benefits, rights and protections are provided on the basis of marital status in Federal law.[1] Further, marriage is known to convey a plethora of health benefits for said couples.[2] Studies have conclusively linked marital status with decreased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer and surgery. Improved mental well health and longer lives.[3] Thus, to permit incestuous marriage would be to grant the same privileges that any other married couple currently enjoys across the globe. The impacts of such are relatively unknown due to the strong legal and social stigma against incestuous relationships.

If closely related individuals have a romantic attraction to each other, the fact they are closely related is not something that is ""correctable"" by either individual, it is inherently unfair. This would be equivalent to prohibiting selling something to someone based on their race or ethnicity, or employment based on their sexuality - clearly none of these have anything to do with one's values or rights as a person. C3. Arbitrarily nature of prohibiting incestuous marriage & relationships The term ""incest"" is a loosely defined word, as it's contingent on society's perception of ""closely related"", however all humans are related on some level, thus incest on some level is occurring within every single relationship on some level, since we are at most 16 generations removed from any other person in 99.98% of cases.[9] Moreover, the practical implementation of laws regarding incest attest to the arbitrary nature with those that do prohibit incest do so with varying ""closeness of relation"", for example the UK prohibits anything closer than first-cousinship (the 12.5% rule), whereas Brazil prohibits only on the third degree (25%) and some states of the US prohibits anything closer than and including first cousinship (6.25%).

The lack of an intrinsic reason regarding closeness of relationship entails there isn't an inherent reason to prohibit incestial relationships, and by extension, marriage. C4.

Term 'bullying' can include one or more of the following terms: ""Violence, extortion, exploitation, abuse, torture, hazing, mental tormenting, harassment, humiliation, dehumanization and social humiliation or defacing. A victim may be bullied by a single offender or by a group of offenders, privately or in front of audience (that may or may not be encouraged to join). To point #1 : Children have plenty of opportunity to confront with others. Every child encounters injustice, disagreement and probably a fight, too. That's plenty of room for the kid to learn how to react appropriately. No bullying is needed for that, and in fact bullying is far beyond acceptable as it may likely to cause the victim a severe emotional trauma with life-time consequences, from sleep, mood and eating disorders to the point of actually committing suicide. The children are the most fragile victims. An experience with bullying can negatively impact victims self-esteem, self-image, development, personality and even abilities in adult life. Every therapist will always examine the patient's childhood assessment, because emotional traumas from the childhood are the hardest to overcome and known for scaring the individual soul at most. Point #2 : There's no such instinct. The instinct tells you to live in your natural habitat (the community), to get along and to belong. And again, bullying doesn't help it at all. While negative feedback is appropriate and helpful for an individual to understand what's acceptable and what isn't, bullying doesn't belong to functional human civilization. Point #3: That's very incorrect. When a bully scares the victim ""to death"" and makes threats e. g. - ""if you tell your parents I'll shoot your dad/mum; or I'll tell my brother who's just out of jail to do this and that"", the parents won't know and they'll wonder why the kid acts strange, why doesn't eat or sleep or behaves in a strange fashion. And bullies often keep their victims in such a deadlock which gives them opportunity to further subdue and control the victim. This obviously damages the child permanently.

That is a blatant cheating of the law. Again, legalizing homosexual marriage would still require monogamy. 6. Education: We have already indoctrinated our youth and society with homophobic propaganda. Conclusion: Gay marriage is an extremely important issue in society today.

A) Sexual Discrimination -- discrimination (usually in employment) that excludes one sex (usually women) to the benefit of the other sex ; Sexism is commonly considered to be discrimination and/or hatred towards people based on their sex rather than their individual merits (Google). Under the provided definition of sexual discrimination, the bar's refusal to grant admittance to men does not warrant such a claim. First, this 'discrimination' has nothing to do with employment opportunities. Second, not allowing men into a lesbian bar does not benefit women, but rather protects them. The act also does not promote hatred against men based on their sex, so first, Pro must prove that sexual discrimination actually even took place. B) Here in the states, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (namely Title VII) discusses what is and isn't permissible in terms of discrimination. An employer, for instance, cannot discriminate based on one's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. They can, however, discriminate based on one's political affiliation, sexuality, and handicaps, for example. Thus even legally - in addition to morally - one has the right to deny entrance into their own private institution. :: POINT 2 :: It's a LESBIAN bar. Pro attempted to enter a lesbian bar. A lesbian is defined as a female homosexual. Assuming that Pro did not attempt to pass as a female (and prove that he was one), or indicate that he was even a homosexual, we can reasonably conclude that Pro was trying to trespass into an institution that is not open to men. So keep this in mind: A) Brian and his friend(s) could presumably meet and befriend lesbians in many other locations - not just this one lesbian bar. B) Like I said, a lesbian bar is a place specifically for lesbians... or at the very least, females. While this may seem unethical, we must also consider other places in society which discriminate admittance or service based on gender. For instance, a female might be refused service at a barber shop because the barber wishes to cut only men's hair. Instead, the woman might be directed to a beauty salon. This is not an example of sexual discrimination, but rather different institutions catering to different wants and needs of the public. C) Women/lesbians might seek refuge at a lesbian bar to avoid the coming-ons of men... meaning this safe haven serves one population of the public - not all. To eliminate such a place would actually be discriminatory against lesbians or females in general -- after all, if places still exist that are for men only (i.e. professional sporting leagues), then to not allow such places for women would be biased and unfair. :: POINT 3 :: The rights of owners/customers. A) As I've mentioned, females may seek refuge at a lesbian bar for a variety of reasons. Who is to say that a woman should not be able to enjoy something without the imposition of male presence? Again the precedent for this lies in other institutions in society. For instance, a female may have no shot at pledging a fraternity, because of the strictly enforced all-male policy. Fraternities are not legal institutions - they are private. Thus businesses are also private - or should be - and owners and patrons alike should have the right to exclude whom they want. B) To elaborate on that point, I'd like to point out why business owners should be allowed to deny admittance of men into a lesbian club. First, they are not making money off it; in fact, they may be losing money (entrance fees, drinks, etc.). Thus the management's sole concern are their patrons. Second, like I said - women might be uncomfortable being in the presence of men. If so, they might not return to the bar/club, meaning management would actually lose money in the future. Unless Brian and his friends would be willing to compensate for the loss of profit, admitting men into this institution would be unprofitable and immoral against business owners. C) In response to my opponent's claim, ""Women are allowed to go into gay bars so men should be allowed into lesbian bars,"" I would like to reiterate that it should be up to the bar's particular management whom they would like to admit. Remember that bars who refuse patronage are taking the risk of assuming the consequences, whatever those might be (i.e. loss of profit, negative portrayal in the media/society, etc.). - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - I'll leave it at this for now...

29,"Gays should be allowed to marry partners of their choice just as heterosexual couples do. It is ignorant in today's world to deny such a basic right to an individual because of something that is innate. Yes, sexuality is not a choice, it is innate. For my first point, let me state that a civil union is not a reasonable compromise for a legal marriage. Most civil unions don't have the same rights as a legal marriage has. Even if we made all civil unions exactly equal to legal marriage but called it something else, it wouldn't be enough. The concept of ""separate but equal"" has already failed. Segregation is not a solution when it comes to rights. History has proven this. Secondly, where is the benefit of oppressing gays from marrying? Religion isn't an answer. Religion is the excuse.

Gays should be allowed to marry partners of their choice just as heterosexual couples do. It is ignorant in today's world to deny such a basic right to an individual because of something that is innate. Yes, sexuality is not a choice, it is innate.  
  
For my first point, let me state that a civil union is not a reasonable compromise for a legal marriage. Most civil unions don't have the same rights as a legal marriage has. Even if we made all civil unions exactly equal to legal marriage but called it something else, it wouldn't be enough. The concept of ""separate but equal"" has already failed. Segregation is not a solution when it comes to rights. History has proven this.  
  
Secondly, where is the benefit of oppressing gays from marrying? Religion isn't an answer. Religion is the excuse. Those who claim it is immoral are really just ignorant and foolish. In the case of Christianity, the bible states to do unto others what you would like done onto you. How would a heterosexual couple like it if it were them in the position of such oppression?",Society,0,Gay-Marraige-Should-Be-Allowed./1/,12957
30,"I will now make my own arguments against the resolution. Negation Case (since Con is actually Pro) P1: The function of a Parole Board As an example, I will use the Adult Parole Board of Victoria [1]. The aim of the board, as stated on the official website: ""The Adult Parole Board of Victoria plays an important role in the Victorian criminal justice system by managing the appropriate release of offenders on parole orders to enhance the safety of the Victorian community. In all decision-making, the Board's most important consideration is community safety."" The functions of this board, taken from the website: ""The role of the Adult Parole Board is to make independent and appropriate decisions in relation to: release of prisoners on supervised conditional release cancellation of orders and return of offenders to prison custody submission of reports to the Minister for Corrections as required by legislation The Board may: grant a prisoner release on parole deny release on parole defer consideration until a later date cancel an offender's parole"" So, a Parole Board is a governing body designed to do these things. A1: Parole Boards are beneficial to a community Parole gives prisoners an incentive to behave and re-enter the community. Especially for younger people, to be stapled with a full-time sentence can ruin a life, for reasons like businesses not wanting to hire criminals. Without parole, prisoners, at the end of their sentences, would be without supervision and incentive to behave. With the Victorian example I am using, there is extensive measures taken to help prevent re-offence, too [2]. Therefore, using a Parole Board, a society can have effective rehabilitation that helps the community, as well as remove those who are likely to re-offend. C: Brief Conclusion Basically, Parole Boards are highly regulated and have strict rules enforced so as to avoid careless release of prisoners. They are not, as my opponent suggests, frivolous with their releases terms. Furthermore, Parole Boards give people second chances and incentives in the criminal justice system. For these reasons, it is clear that the Parole Board has not failed in protecting the community. I await my opponent's affirmative case. Until then, the resolution is negated. References [1] <URL>...

  The basic point is that we need to restrict ourselves to the basic immutable code as laid down in the Koran and Sunnah.  
  That being said, I will now proceed to analyze your argument.  
  If you notice, the examples given by me did not fall into any of the categories of unlawful “knowledge”.  
  I do not see how Sharia forbids all forms of science.  
  The Banu Musa also worked in astronomical observations established in Baghdad by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun.   
  The Abbasid Caliphate or, more simply, the Abbasids (Arabic: العبّاسيّون‎ / ISO 233: al-‘abbāsīyūn), was the third of the Islamic caliphates.  
  The term caliphate ""dominion of a caliph ('successor')"" (from the Arabic خلافة or khilāfa, Turkish: Halife), refers to the first system of government established in Islam and represented the political unity of the Muslim Ummah (community).   
  http://en.wikipedia.org...  
  The banu musa brothers worked in astronomical observations established by an Islamic system of government, is it not reasonable to assume that they would have to work within the framework established by the third Islamic caliphate (around 200 years after the death of the prophet)?  
  If not, I await you to prove otherwise.

43,"Okay, so PRO ignores a whole chunk of refutation and chooses only to respond to those that she can. Many families would much prefer to have their own genetic children than adopt, although that is not deal, it is the truth, why would a couple choose not to have children if they really wanted them? If a disorder is gender specific this would be a medical breakthrough for families with those fears. Don't you think, that if the families knew they had a genetic disease, they would much rather adopt? Yes I know what you are talking about, you're talking about how families would rather have children related to them. You can't compare these two families. The family you are talkign about has no genetic disorder. The family I am talking about has the gender genetic disorder. This family, would be much more likely to adopt because they would not want to put their child at risk. If they really wanted a child, they could adopt one. Furthermore, the genetic disorder cannot be guaranteed not to be to entirely absent from their child, even if it is not the gender specific for the disorder. As such, even with gender selection, the couple is taking a risk. As a couple who wants to have a healthy child, adoption would be a better solution. Is this necessarily a bad thing? We are living in an extremely over populated world, although it hasn't quite hit America yet as its such a vast landmass, countries such as Britain, France, Germany, India, China and Japan are vastly over populated, the human race has doubled in population since the 1800's and we have four times as many people as their were in the first century. Slowing down the worlds reproductive rate would in no way be a bad thing. In countries with no gender bias such as the USA the ratio of male:female babies would very likely stay the same. Yes, that is a bad thing. You're thinking only in the short term. Think about the long, long term. At first, yes, population levels will slowly decrease because of gender selection, there would not be enough couples to go around and reproduce. Now flash forward a few hundred years. The human population has now dimished to maybe a billion people, because there are not enough people to reproduce. Now, it poses a severe problem. Even if we wanted to reproduce and increase the population again, we can't, because of gender selection. IF we continuously cannot reproduce, the human population will eventually be endangered. This is not what we want to accomplish. Eventually, gender selection must be illegalized to save the human race and we would have accomplished nothing. It is better to illegalize it now. You are oblivious to the fact that this probelm will increase exponentially over time, as couples become more and more gender specific. This poses a huge problem to the human population. In developing countries contraception/birth control isn't readily available and as for families that are trying for children, why would they try to prevent conception? Sure, then they could go and have babies. I don't understand what you're trying to say. If you are trying for conception and do not care about the gender of your baby, you should not use birth control methods. If you truly want to have a child, you would not care about the gender, and would not use birth control. Thus, there would be no feeling of abandonment. Is abortion really a more moral than choosing the sex of the baby off the bat? Creating a life just to then destroy it, I am in no way 'anti-abortion' when it is necessary, but I think trying to have a baby and terminating it once you find out the sex is wrong. Also, ultrasounds often tell the sex of the baby around 20 weeks and in many countries the cut off date for an abortion is 12 weeks. So aborting it after determining the sex would be both morally and legally wrong. Thus gender selection eliminates both the need for an abortion as well as the moral and legal issues. You talk as if gender selection is moral. The main issue with abortion is that it causes harm to the baby. But how do you know that gender selection will not cause harm as well? Maybe it would cause a baby to be too masculine or feminine and you end up with homosexual babies. This could also create a feeling of dissappointment from parents and abandonment, that you claim to be so bad. Furthermore, in the future when gender selection is possible, maybe we'll have better methods of abortion. You never know. I hate to bring personal matters and experience into this debate but I know many women who have had miscarriages and tried for a baby a year or two later, my grandmother being one of them, so I know from personal experience that having the baby you once lost can help a lot of emotional pain. Cool, and I have a grandmother who had a miscarriage that did not not try for another baby ever. You also talked about filling the void. Why does the gender have to be the same? Again, if you truly wanted a child, you would not care about the gender of the child. This device only promotes the exploitation of children to achieve selfish means, such as the chinese mentality to carry on the family name with males. Therefore, this should not be legalized.",1,Hardcore.Pwnography,"

45,"First of all, here's my inspiration for this debate: I am writing this from one of my local bar / restaurants where a fellow customer - an older gentleman who I know only to say ""hello"" to, greeted me and addressed me as ""Sir"" as I walked in. This was just seconds after I had given directions to a stranger, who was, again, older than me, who also addressed me as ""Sir"". Just to let you know, due to a scandalous oversight in this year's Queen's Honours List, my considerable contributions to British society have yet again failed to be formally recognised and, as a result, I am still waiting for the knighthood I so richly deserve! Until this outrageous injustice has been resolved, there is, therefore, no reason to address me as ""Sir"" - plain ""Mister"" will do just fine. The fact is, British people have the concept of social deference installed in them at an early age. So, because I am usually quite smartly-dressed and well-spoken, I am called ""Sir"", which I am very uncomfortable with as I consider myself working class (even if nobody else does) and also because I refuse to address anybody, except the ennobled or officially titled people as ""Sir"" or ""Madam"", and even then I do so reluctantly. It is similar in America, even more prolific, especially in hotels and restaurants, though the distinction between the social classes there is much more blurred and a big difference is that the staff only call customers ""Sir"" and ""Madam"" because it is part of their job description.

First of all, here's my inspiration for this debate:  
  
I am writing this from one of my local bar / restaurants where a fellow customer - an older gentleman who I know only to say ""hello"" to, greeted me and addressed me as ""Sir"" as I walked in. This was just seconds after I had given directions to a stranger, who was, again, older than me, who also addressed me as ""Sir"".  
  
Just to let you know, due to a scandalous oversight in this year's Queen's Honours List, my considerable contributions to British society have yet again failed to be formally recognised and, as a result, I am still waiting for the knighthood I so richly deserve! Until this outrageous injustice has been resolved, there is, therefore, no reason to address me as ""Sir"" – plain ""Mister"" will do just fine.  
  
The fact is, British people have the concept of social deference installed in them at an early age. So, because I am usually quite smartly-dressed and well-spoken, I am called ""Sir"", which I am very uncomfortable with as I consider myself working class (even if nobody else does) and also because I refuse to address anybody, except the ennobled or officially titled people as ""Sir"" or ""Madam"", and even then I do so reluctantly.  
  
It is similar in America, even more prolific, especially in hotels and restaurants, though the distinction between the social classes there is much more blurred and a big difference is that the staff only call customers ""Sir"" and ""Madam"" because it is part of their job description.  
  
In conclusion, I affirm that we should actively discourage the forelock-tugging, class-ridden practice of calling fellow members of society ""Sir"" and ""Madam"" and stick to ""Mister"" and ""Missus"" in a similar way to the way French people refer to strangers as ""Monsieur"" and ""Madame"" or ""Mademoiselle"".

48,"I would like to thank Con for this debate. Con's Case 1. The idea that ""society has progressed"" is a red herring in this debate. Remember, we are arguing about conformity not whether society has changed. Con associates modern times with non-conformity and the past with conformity. I disagree. The goalposts have simply shifted. Con rightly states ""today we have a different set of values"" and those values clearly still entail social constructs and norms. Con notes that we realize that discrimination is not acceptable, and in many groups today that holds true. Much of what was wrong in the past is considered acceptable today, and vice-versa. It works both ways, as I could just as easily evoke the idea that children should be able to get married or polygamy and get that same level of outcry today that was used in your example about gay marriage. In conclusion, Con's argument that today is somehow ""non-conformist"" seems arbitrary. We conform to our own standards. 2. Con speaks in very broad concepts here: ""[Today] people are developing their personalities...to be is who they actually are, not what they want to be."" I don't know what this means or to what extent this is different from the past. Certainly, mainstream society is more accepting of certain views than others, but there are still taboos. Is a racist more ""free"" to develop his personality today? How about a social conservative on a liberal college campus? Con is practicing a selective bias here. Con's argument is a little confusing here. He talks about how being an individual is ""trendy"" and that we follow this ""trend."" Is Con just substituting ""trends"" for ""conforming?"" It would seem so. I would really like Con to clarify this in the next round. Were people not individuals 40 years ago? How about 400? Which year did people start becoming individuals rather than brain dead conformists? Pro's Case: 1. Psychological experimentation has repeatedly confirmed the power of conformity. Two prominent experiments in this field have been the Asch and the Milgram experiment. Both experiments demonstrated the power that a group consensus or authority figure can hold over an individual. The Asch experiment, for example, asked groups questions about the lengths of lines and then asked for judgments to be made. The control group gave only one incorrect answer of 35, while the experimental (peer pressure) group led test subjects to answer over 1/3 of the questions incorrectly. Follow up experiments confirmed this effect, namely - that group pressure can largely sway individual judgment. The force was greatest when there was a large number of individuals that strongly voiced the incorrect opinion [1]. The Milgram experiment, similarly, showed how individuals were able to suppress their own moral judgments when faced with an authority figure. In this experiment, the ""teachers"" (test subjects) were instructed to shock ""learners"" (actually recordings, no one got hurt) as a method of teaching them word associations. When an incorrect answer was given, the learner received a shock administered by the teacher. The levels of shock were gradually increased, and the learners recordings were heard by the teacher so he could hear the pain that was inflicted. Shockingly, 65% of the participants reached the maximum voltage level of 450 volts after being coaxed by the scientist [2]. The learners stopped reacting after large bouts of screams indicating that they were unconscious if not dead. 2. Social norms exist, and there are consequences for violating them. Despite Con's attempt to frame the modern day as an era of individuality, there are still very basic social norms that govern human behavior. We operate inside a social network and implicitly abide by social norms that are realized at an early age. Remember, by saying ""slave"" we are claiming that these social norms exists and exert a clear, strong effect on the individual. The violation of some social norms leads to arrest - having sex with a minor, shoplifting, urinating on lawns - while others just entail social consequences. These social norms are inescapable and govern everyone's behavior, unless perhaps you live alone on top of a mountain. All members of society are binded by these norms. How about if I try to rebel? Lets say tomorrow I wake up and threw on some black clothing and eyeliner. Unfortunately, that look is already a little slice of society that has been claimed by the Goths, and in doing so I am conforming to their group standards. I could make the exact same point with hippies, punks, or jocks - name the high school stereotype. Now, if I really wanted to get creative I could go outside with only underwear on my head but this is too much of a violation of norms and I would be arrested. My refusal to conform would lead society to step in and directly stop my act. However, there is a middle ground between arrest and normality where social consequences occur that serve as an incentive or disincentive for individuals to follow a given social norm. In conclusion, these norms are an inescapable part of society that play a large role in governing our individual behavior. Additionally, it is much harder than one thinks to truly be a ""non-conformist"" given the multitude and diversity of groups that comprise a society, and the consequences for true violations of social norms are often direct and may even carry a sentence. The social norms that a society holds bind its members like a social glue in a clear and powerful sense, for better or for worse. [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...",1,OMGJustinBieber,"

Fathers are responsible for their children. I will not, however, accept responsibility for a child without also being afforded the same rights and privileges to the child as the mother. When a woman seeks an abortion she should be required to declare the identity of the father. His written authorization should be obtained before the procedure may be administered.

Process of a bill becoming a law I fail to see the weight in my opponent's argument concerning how a bill becomes a law. I am well aware of the process, but this fails to show for my opponent why gay marriage shouldn't be legalized. It basically amounts to that since gay marriage hasn't been made legal by the federal government, it shouldn't be legal. Is it just me or is that just absolutely redundant!?

The role of who should legalize it is of no concern in this debate. 2. 55% of Americans oppose gay marriage As I've stated before, just because a slight majority of Americans oppose gay marriage, this shows nothing on whether or not gay marriage should be legal, only that Americans oppose it.

Do note that a well 3/4 of America is Christian [1], and thus many would oppose gay marriage based solely on religious purposes.

Comment about ""Yeah, screw democracy"" First of all, I agreed with that statement in a partially sarcastic manner, though it probably wasn't clear. However, this is once again a FAILED argument. Not only should the comment section be out of the context of this debate, but whether or not I support democracy (which I do) has no merit on the legality of gay marriage. ""Homosexual Americans have EXACTLY the same rights as heterosexual Americans, no less and no more. Both groups of people are permitted to marry someone of the opposite sex."" --> EXCEPT MARRIAGE. Which is exactly the point of this debate. The point is, homosexual people want to marry, uh duh, the same gender! Not allowing them this option is taking away a right that is theirs. ~Conclusion~ In the progression of this brief debate, my opponent has given no substantial argument against gay marriage. The only feasible argument was his slippery slope argument, but he has failed to bring it back up. I tackled that argument in a new way, by asking him why polygamy, bestiality, or incest should be illegal if they all involve consenting adults. His recurring point is about 55% of Americans being opposed to gay marriage, but I clearly showed that to be a fallacious argument.

--> EXCEPT MARRIAGE. Which is exactly the point of this debate. The point is, homosexual people want to marry, uh duh, the same gender! Not allowing them this option is taking away a right that is theirs.  
  
~Conclusion~  
  
In the progression of this brief debate, my opponent has given no substantial argument against gay marriage. The only feasible argument was his slippery slope argument, but he has failed to bring it back up. I tackled that argument in a new way, by asking him why polygamy, bestiality, or incest should be illegal if they all involve consenting adults. His recurring point is about 55% of Americans being opposed to gay marriage, but I clearly showed that to be a fallacious argument. For all the reasons I have shown, and for all the points I have refuted, vote for Pro.

70,"I thank my opponent for his argument. I will briefly rebut the argument that Con gave me. REBUTTAL All Con said during his second round was that cigarette is harmful. He listed various ways that cigarette can be harmful. In this debate discussing about the total ban of cigarette, there are two things that Con has to show: 1) that harm of cigarette calls for radical action of ban, 2) that the ban is a plausible action. Con failed to fulfill both criteria by only giving medical argument, omitting the explanation as to why such medical factors call for ban. Con's entire round 2 can be rebutted in different layers. Just about anything can harm one's health. Smoke from factories, electricity and cars kill people in many ways. Just because something is bad, it does not equal to a ban. Just because cars emit smoke, cause accidents and require factories in the process of manufacture, we do not ban cars since benefit outweighs the harm. Again, smokers are aware of these harms of smoking and yet they still choose to smoke. Moreover, cigarette provides recreational activity to individuals. Additionally, Con failed to combat other benefits that we lose by banning cigarette and benefits we gain from keeping cigarette. By banning cigarette, we are also hugely limiting freedom and rights of citizen. We are also oppressing industry that worth hundreds of billion dollars, placing workers of this humongous industry out of work and losing billions of tax revenue. Despite all these drawbacks in several aspects, does it still worth to ban cigarette? Con obviously failed to answer this question. I look forward reading round 3.",1,Ike-Jin-Park,"

71,"Thank you for the debate topic, I hope this will be an enlightening discussion for us both. Not sure if we are making arguments first round but since no prerequisite was made I will assume its okay. Pro asks why Africa is still a 3rd world continent after 33 years of raising millions? Well the fact of the matter is that the money being sent to these places is sent to give commodities such as food and water to the people who are suffering. And usually its given to people in power to distribute which allows for exploitation in many different forms. Beside that the commodities that are given away don't improve infrastructure or give incentives for business to form or thrive in that area. So just because these charitable goods are being given doesn't mean they will be benefiting the society as a whole. All they do is provide temporary relief to specific groups of people. This is at least for most cases of charity. To the issue of charities needing to tell you exactly what they are spending the money on the only thing you need to look at is the charity as a private or public charity. If the charity is private then you have no right to see what they are spending the money on unless it is said in making the donation that you can. As a private entity the charity organization can do whatever they want with your money and they can choose not to tell you. This is why people should be hesitant with charity. It is solely your faith in this charity and its promise that gets you to donate. But once you have made that donation its their money. As a private entity they can do what they want with their money just like any other entity. Its like if you get paid and your boss wants to know that the money he's paying you is going to your livelihood. Its none of his business even though he's transferring that money to you. Its because at the point of transfer its your money. If you don't trust the charity don't donate to it. But you cant force a private charity to show where the money is going.
