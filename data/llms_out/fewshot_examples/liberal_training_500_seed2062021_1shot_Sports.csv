0,"Thanks to Pro for initiating this good topic. I'm very passionate about this issue and look forward to debating it. Definitions: I accept my opponent's definition of Better. The word ""is"" indicates that this is about the present time, not 5 or 10 years ago. Though I feel LeBron has been better for the last 5 years, the resolution questions the present time only. C1: Stats The best stats we can use come from last year's basketball season. Lebron averaged more points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks, and had a better field goal percentage and shot the three better (1,2). In the playoffs he had a better field goal percent, as well as more rebounds, assists, and blocks again. The John Hollinger efficiency ratings put LeBron as the most efficient player in the league, 4 spots ahead of Kobe (3). People also love to say how clutch Kobe is. Actually, this is more a product of how many last minute shots he takes rather than how often he makes them. You're bound to make a game-winner every now and then when you're taking them all the time. Kobe only averages 31% shooting in the clutch, over 10% less than his normal average. LeBron has a higher shot % in the same time period (4). C2: Other things Kobe is 33 and LeBron is 26. Most fans can agree that a player's athleticism starts to fade in the thirties. This is evident as he takes more jumpshots now than at any point in his career, rather then driving to the basket which would require elusiveness he simply doesn't have anymore. This is also shown by his field goal % and points per game declining in recent years. C3: Kobe has a bad personality This doesn't actually relate to being a better basketball player, but I feel like bringing this up. Kobe had 16 technical fouls last year (5). A technical foul is attributed to poor conduct on the basketball court, such as excessive arguing with refs, verbally abusing other players, or starting fights. Lebron on the other hand only had 7, despite being the person everybody's looking for to do something bad. Kobe was also fined $100,000 last year for yelling a gay slur at a referree. After receiving another technical foul, Kobe argued with the ref briefly before sitting down on the bench. After slamming his towel on the ground, Kobe yelled ""Hey Bennie!"" (the ref), and when the ref looked his way, Kobe called him a ""F*cking faggot"". (6) Conclusion Even discounting the personal stuff, the numbers show that at the very least, LeBron is a better basketball player at the present time. I look forward to my opponent's reply. 1. <URL>... 2. <URL>... 3. <URL>... 4. <URL>... 5. <URL>... 6. <URL>...",1,BlackVoid,"

2,"First, I'd like to welcome my friend for creating her first debate, despite her making her account so long ago. Second, I'd like to own her in this debate. The resolution is ""Mario Mendoza was a good baseball player."" I have to argue that Mario Mendoza was a good baseball player. This is just obvious. Mendoza's reputation is as one of the worst MAJOR LEAGUE baseball players of all-time. However, as we all know, the Major Leagues are most likely the most talented baseball league in the world. As of today, there are 30 teams x 25 players/team = 750 Major League players at any one time. Compared to the average citizen-no, even the average baseball player, any Major League player is a beast. Only the best of the best of the best ever sniff the Major Leagues in their lifetimes. Let's shoot low and say there are 1000 high schools in the nation with baseball teams (obviously, there are far more). Then, there are at least 9 players per team. That means there are 9000 high school baseball players. Now, let's say there are 100 colleges with baseball teams (obviously there are far more), and they have 9 players per team. Now, let's say there are 3 minor league teams (each organization actually has 4 or 5) and that each minor league team has 25 players. 3 minor league teams/major league teams x 30 major league teams x 20 (again, the typical professional roster has about 25 players, so we're shooting low) players/minor league team = more than 1500 players. Add all those up, and with ridiculously low estimates, we see more than 10,000 baseball players at levels less talented than the Majors. Clearly, even if a player is horrible in the Majors, like Mario Mendoza, he is better than 10,000 other baseball players-99.99th percentile, about. Keep in mind the unbelievably low estimates I used, and Mendoza is still better than 10,000. I'd say that makes him a good baseball player. The resolution is affirmed. Vote PRO.",1,iamadragon,"

Distance Track shall be defined as the 400 meter dash, 800 meter run, 1600 meter run, 3200 meter run, 3200 meter relay, and 1600 meter relay. If I forgot any events let me know in the comments. Let's just keep the considerations between the high school version of these sports.

5,"Jameis Winston is ready for the Pros. My opponent wants to say Jameis Winston should not enter the NFL draft for personal character reasons. As the NFL does not have any real qualms about allowing people with troubled pasts join their organization I do not think it is up for him to remove himself from the draft. If a team wants to take him then he has the right to let them try and pick him up. If he's picked then great for him but character shouldn't hold him back. Why? His talent is incredible. In 27 games played he went 26-1. Threw for 7,964 yards (nearly 4,000 a year). Threw 65 Touchdowns. Had a rating of 163.3 Won the Heisman. Won two ACC Championship games. Won a National Championship. [ <URL>... ] Simply put, there is nothing left for Jameis to do in college. He's won and achieved everything a player can even dream of attaining and he did it in two years. Now its time to go pro. Jameis doesn't need an education to play NFL football and his past antics have shown that he doesn't value education much anyways. He may have to develop more as a person but why not do that as part of a professional team? There is nothing left for him to do in college, time to move on. Character flaws do not outweigh the stunning body of work Jameis has put in. His talent is beyond ready for the NFL. Now its up to the NFL to decide if his character flaws are a downside or not.",1,Clovis,"

I say put the drugs aside and look at what they accomplished in their lives. This includes Alex Rodriguez. So I say Alex Rodriguez was a great player especially for his age.

10,"That's not the resolution. The debate is whether or not Mario Mendoza was a good baseball player, plain and simple. When judging whether or not someone is good at something, we look at how he does compared to any other person doing that thing. As I showed in Round 1, using low estimates, Mendoza is still far superior to the vast majority of baseball players. If we only judged a baseball player by how he does in his own league, and we suddenly put Mendoza against a bunch of Little Leaguers and he crushed home runs in every AB, would we call him the best baseball player ever? No. We need to look at the talent he's facing. The better the talent one faces, the better he looks if he does well, and the less bad he looks if he doesn't do well. Again, as I showed, Mendoza is superior to an incredibly large number of baseball players just by virtue of his playing in the Major Leagues. Thus, he is a good baseball player.
