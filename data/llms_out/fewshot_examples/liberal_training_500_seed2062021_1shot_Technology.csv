0,"Thanks for starting this debate, Sumone2Every1. I am on the Proposition stating that Facebook is better than Twitter. Here are my arguments. 1. Facebook is better than Twitter because it appeals to people looking to reconnect with old friends and family members or find new friends online. Facebook is user-friendly whereas Twitter is not. 2. Twitter has limited functionality and as a result, not all people find it useful. That's it for this round. I look forward to the Opposition's response of how Twitter is better than Facebook.",1,XStrikeX,"

I am on the Proposition stating that Facebook is better than Twitter.  
  
Here are my arguments.  
  
1. Facebook is better than Twitter because it appeals to people looking to reconnect with old friends and family members or find new friends online. Facebook is user-friendly whereas Twitter is not.  
  
2. Twitter has limited functionality and as a result, not all people find it useful.

1,"A big thanks to my opponent for his responses. Let's get right to it. Rebuttal 1: Jellyfish As this (the farming of jellyfish) was a rather unconventional argument, and not one I was familiar with, I began my research from the sites Con sourced. After reading both articles several times, it is revealed that the increasing number of jellyfish has nothing to do with overfishing of jellyfish, but overfishing other species of fish. As predators of the jellyfish decrease in number (due to overfishing), the jellyfish population increases. Further reading proves that it is precisely the sheer number of jellyfish that would cause the issues Con mentions (loss of jobs, danger in the water, decline in fish prices, etc.). As such, using jellyfish protein would seem to have the opposite effect Con proposes, actually benefiting the fishing industry tremendously by removing unwanted and burdensome jellyfish from the areas. Rebuttal 2: Removal of Existing Roads As stated in round one, one of the many conveniences in building solar roadways is that the panels can be built on top of the asphalt roads. The removal of existing roads in unnecessary. Rebuttal 3: NF3 in the Atmosphere While it is true that NF3 warms the atmosphere about 17,000 more times than CO2, it's important to note in what context it is being used. Firstly, the solar panels themselves don't produce the gas; the use of a solar power wouldn't be emitting any nitrogen trifluoride. The NF3 is used during the production of solar panels and there are many options available to reduce emissions. <URL>... In addition, the majority of solar panels don't actually even use NF3. It is only used in a particular kind of panel that is not common. <URL>... Rebuttal 4 and Rebuilding Contentions: Economy As a rebuttal, I'd like to turn our attention to the Golden Gate Bridge. This suspension bridge allows travelers to cross the three mile distance between San Francisco to Marin County. It has been declared one of the 'Wonders of the Modern World'. <URL>... The reason I bring this up is because the construction of this bridge started in 1933 and was completed in 1937. This places the time frame right at the heart of the Great Depression. Even during the time of economic despair, great things were in the process of being made. Just because economic times are hard for us now should not prevent us from paving the way to a brighter future. And while there must obviously be limitations (self-preserving ice cream isn't our priority), the sheer number of benefits solar roadways offer make them a worthwhile pursuit. First of all, running the solar-energy route means that these panels will pay for their cost over time. Secondly, by implementing solar panels as roads, we'd be able to cut back/eliminate costs on asphalt roads, power plants, and power and data delivery systems. There would also be additional costs saved by solar roadways in health insurance. The many possibilities of the solar roadway include illuminating night roads, automatic removal of snow and ice, and pedestrian/ wildlife avoidance systems which will inevitably lead to safer driving conditions, further eliminating costs of production. <URL>... Most importantly, the same tax money that is used to build, repair and resurface roads can instead be put into building solar road panels. <URL>... All in all, the implementation of solar roadways can not only pay for itself overtime, but save countless costs along the way as well, while creating a cleaner environment, less pollution, safer driving conditions, eliminating oil dependency and providing a road that pays for itself. Also, in response to Brusaw stating that the road might fail, the website cited says no such thing. The ecofriend.com website also admits that though it might take several years, the return on investments will eventually cover the costs. For such large returns, it seems to be worth the effort. Rebuttal 5: Durable Solar Panels The solar website cited doesn't say that the panels aren't durable, but that the 'full extent of their durability is unknown'. The solar panels themselves are being tested now and retested in laboratories. They will only be implemented once they are proven to be strong enough to carry the necessary loads. The website mentioned also does not say that creating durable panels will skyrocket prices, nor does it say up keep will more or less eliminate profits. Rebuttal 6: Glare The design for the panel is to be shatterproof and glare proof. <URL> Rebuilding Contention: Environment and Energy Production My opponent mentioned that solar panels only collect 14% of what they receive. Scott Brusaw estimates that they will have 18.5% efficiency and with that assumption, plus an average of only four hours optimum sunlight a day, he calculates that the panels would produce 13,961 billion kilowatt-hours. That figure is after subtracting 31% from the total number due to lack of slant in the solar panels. <URL>... Brusaw estimates that this is enough to produce three times the electricity we have ever used! And that solar roadways placed in driveways and parking lots could power not just the roads, but homes and businesses! I'd like to once again thank my opponent for his thoughtful answers.

4,"Thanks for this debate and good luck: DEFINITIONS: -Impact -From: Merriam-Webster ( <URL>... ) -""To have a direct effect or impact on."" Resolutional Analysis: The burden of proof lies with pro. -Within this debate, it is pro's job to prove that there is some sort of positive impact on the United States. Therefore, if I prove negative effect or neutral effect, I ought to win. -Therefore, my claim is simple: That social networking websites have a NEUTRAL impact on the United States. A. Social Networking Sites are simply a tool. - Since Social Networking Sites are generally meant for friends meeting up with each other and sharing information, you will see that these sites are simply a tool for people to use. Thus, this debate asks the question, does the tool have an impact? And the answer is no. You see, it is the PEOPLE THAT USE THE TOOL that determines what kind of impact exists. A person could use these sites well and nothing bad could happen, OR someone could anonymously abuse someone to the point of suicide on these same sites. For example: A hammer is a tool. A person could use the hammer to build a house. But a person could also use the same hammer to murder someone. Do either of these actions determine the impact of the tool? No... Therefore, it is the PEOPLE that determine whether it will impact anyone positively or negatively. B. Definition (of impact) places no impact on Social Networking Sites. -How can something have a 'direct effect' on something when it doesn't have a brain? It doesn't think. And it therefore can't positively or negatively impact anything. In the end of this debate, ask yourself... Does a hammer build a house or does a person build a house with a hammer? Does a hammer kill someone, or does a person kill a person with a hammer? Does a gun kill someone, or does someone kill a person with a gun? Does a gun protect a family from a robber, or does someone protect a family from a robber with a gun?
