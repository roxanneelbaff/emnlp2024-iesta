First, I'd like to start out with some definitions so we're all talking about the same thing here. Advertise: to announce or praise (a product, service, etc.) in some public medium of communication in order to induce people to buy or use it: to advertise a new brand of toothpaste. [1] Manipulate: to manage or influence skillfully, especially in an unfair manner. [2] Manipulation: the act of manipulating. [3] Information: knowledge communicated or received concerning a particular fact or circumstance. [4] Media: the means of communication, as radio and television, newspapers, and magazines, that reach or influence people widely. [5] Advertising: the act or practice of calling public attention to one's product, service, need, etc., especially by paid announcements in newspapers and magazines, over radio or television, on billboards, etc. [6] I'll summarize my opponent's case as follows: P1: Media is considered important, yet report different facts. P2: In societies that seek to maximize profits, advertising turns into manipulation. P3: Advertising is information violence. C: Advertising is manipulation I'm sorry if that's not quite what you were trying to say but I tried to pick out your major points. P1: Media is considered important, yet report different facts. Media of course has two separate contexts - media as in the form of communication or media as in the corporations that own the form of communication (e.g. New York Times, ABC, BBC, etc.). I would argue that this is good thing. Having multiple sources of information is critical to better understanding our world and validating the truthfulness of any media outlet. I don't see how my opponent could be down on media for this or why the media should be blamed for any supposed evil of advertising. P2: In societies that seek to maximize profits, advertising turns into manipulation. I'm not sure what societies in particular that my opponent is referring to but I'll assume those that are at least partially capitalistic. Unlike the free societies where capitalism is practiced, unfree societies are where one is forced to do things against their will. Take for example, Saudi Arabia where anyone of non-Muslim belief is not able to openly practice their religion. Or even Russia when it was under Communist rule, you bought a certain brand because that is all that the State offered. That is being forced to do something against your will. Advertising allows the consumer to be aware of various products and who offers them. The buyer then makes a choice based on their own needs, preferences and ability to buy. This is hardly manipulation. In order to manipulate the advertiser would have to intentionally unfairly influence the buyer. But how is this happening? All advertisers freely market their wares in free societies so there is no unfair influence that I can tell. P3: Advertising is information violence. I'm not quite sure what Pro means by information violence. It seems this is a reference to advertising making people do what they don't want to do against their own interest. This is simply untrue. No matter what economic system is employed people always act in their perceived best interest. Again, with Russia during the Soviet era there was a huge black market for goods not allowed by the state. So even when advertising isn't allowed people still seek out the goods they want. Whether those goods are bad for their interest is not the fault of advertising. Conclusion: My opponent's entire case is an assertion. If she cares to back up her claims with facts, I'll rebut those. Since, the burden on proof is on Pro, I fail to see how she has made her case. Sources: [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>... [3] <URL>... [4] <URL>... [5] <URL>...

The EPA has recently, in 2015, broadened their definition of these waterways to, \" 'waters of the United States' so broadly that it covers virtually any wet spot - or occasionally wet spot - in the country, including ditches, drains, seasonal puddle-like depressions, intermittent streams, ponds, impoundments, prairie potholes, and large 'buffer areas' of land adjacent to every waterway.\" [2] Due to this we can see how ridiculous this is as these areas are not even close to being that of navigable and this is just simply absurd as these waters might not even run off into rivers, lakes, nor the ocean.

Mr. Gaizano, head of the Senate Committee of the Environment stated on the rulings that, \"it is not just costly and destructive for farmers, ranchers, and rural residents,\" but also that \"urban and suburban citizens and their local governments will be subject to increasing federal micro management and costly mandates.\" [3] Here we can see that even the head of the commitee in the senate is showcasing how awful it is that our own executive branch is growing and abusing power to that of hurting our own economy from not just big business, but the common man is being harmed to.

Premise 1 is metaphysically true--namely, something cannot possibly come from nothing, the denial of which is absurd. If something can come into existence without a cause, then we are begging the question as to why we do not have any examples of this constantly happening. The question: Why doesn't everything and anything pop into existence withotu a cause? The reason is because nothingness is constrained by physical laws, for there is nothing to constrain. To deny premise 1 is to deny causual regularity. Philosopher David Oderberg has argued that the first premise is necessarily true: We are asked to countenance the possibility of the following situation: the nonexistence of anything followed by the existence of something. The words \"followed by\" are crucial -- how are they to be interpreted? What they cannot mean is that there is at one time nothing and at a subsequent time something, because the nonexistence of anything is supposed toinclude time: to say that at one time there is nothing whatsoever is self-defeating because it is to say that there is a time at which nothing exists -- hence something did exist. But it is hard to see how else we are supposed to understand \"followed by\"; or when the denier of the causal principle says that it is possible for something to come from nothing what are we to understand by \"from\"? Again it cannot have a causal sense because something is supposed to have come into existence uncaused. All that appears to be left is a timeless contradiction -- the existence of nothing and the existence of something. [1] Premise 2 is supported by both philisophical and scientific evidence.

Such beliefs are without hard physical evidence and must therefore be considered unfalsifiable , currently outside the methodology of scientific investigation to confirm or disprove, and therefore more mathematically theoretical and metaphysical than scientific in nature. Recent cosmological evidence also suggests insufficient mass for gravity to reverse continuing cosmic expansion. The best cosmological evidence thus far suggests the cosmos is finite rather than infinite in age.\" [2] Likwise, phenomena such as redshift, cosmic background radiation, the expansion of the universe, and the second law of thermodynamics point towards the idea that the universe did indeed begin to exist. Any universe in a state of cosmic expansion must be finite in past duration. [3] Philisophically, if the universe were to have been eternal, this implies the existence of an actual infinite. However, we know that it is impossible for an actually infinite set of things to exist; hence, the universe must be finite in past duration. From this is follows that the universe has a cause. But why think this cause is God? Contradiction argues: Firstly, it must be noted that since there is nothing prior to the cause of the universe, it cannot be explained scientifically, as this would imply the existence of antecedent determining conditions. Hence, because there are no prior determining conditions, the cause of the universe must be personal and uncaused, for how else could a timeless cause give rise to a temporal effect? Moreover, the cause must transcend space both matter and time to create both matter and time. It must also be changeless, since there was no time prior to the creation of the universe. Finally, in order to create the universe ex nihilo, this cause must be enormously powerful, if not omnipotent. One is warranted in concluding that therefore, God exists. [4] Second, Matt Slick notes: \"A single uncaused cause of the universe must be greater in size and duration than the universe it has brought into existence; otherwise, we would have the uncaused cause bringing into existence something greater than or equal to itself.

As such, the US needs to be able to respond quickly and decisively to threats before they materialize. Furthermore, even if the US were to rely exclusively on multilateral approaches, it could still pursue cooperative efforts through economic sanctions, arms embargoes, and other nonviolent means \u2013 all of which require advance coordination and planning.

Use of Force Principles  In the absence of an attack or imminent threat, five core principles should guide our decision-making. These prudent principles recognize the dangers and unintended consequences inherent in any use of force, as well as the occasional necessity of military action to protect our security and the lives of others. The Duty to Prevent: The duty to prevent is a principle needed in a world where terrorists can wreak the kind of destruction once reserved to states. It affirms that national governments have a responsibility to prevent grave dangers from emerging from inside their territory; if they fail to do so, other countries have a right to intervene to forestall the threat. For instance, the Taliban\u2019s blatant shirking of its duty to prevent Al Qaeda from launching attacks from Afghanistan prior to 9/11, or to bring them to justice afterward, provided America with the right to use force in self-defense to remove an intolerable danger. Looking ahead, military intervention would be justified if a government with nuclear capacity intended to transfer a nuclear bomb to terrorists, or was unable to stop such a transfer.

Sixty years later, most Americans correctly perceived that military action against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan needed to be part of our response to 9/11. We must also be prepared to act when an ally we have promised by treaty to protect is attacked or imminently threatened. Security guarantees, such as those we provide to NATO allies, and those enshrined in the UN Charter, are essential to global stability. In addition, the United States has unique relationships with vulnerable targets that are not treaty-protected allies - notably Taiwan and Israel. American support for them can prevent war by signaling to other powers that these friends of the United States will not stand alone if they are attacked without provocation. Harder decisions involve security threats that are not imminent, and cases of large-scale atrocities. Should we use force to prevent a hostile government from developing nuclear weapons, to weaken an anti-American group forming terrorist cells in another country, or to protect a vulnerable population from ethnic cleansing? Many Americans would answer \"sometimes,\" and ultimately these decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. But our decision-making in these harder cases would benefit from the articulation of principles outlining the circumstances that call for intervention. Use of Force Principles In the absence of an attack or imminent threat, five core principles should guide our decision-making. These prudent principles recognize the dangers and unintended consequences inherent in any use of force, as well as the occasional necessity of military action to protect our security and the lives of others. The Duty to Prevent: The duty to prevent is a principle needed in a world where terrorists can wreak the kind of destruction once reserved to states. It affirms that national governments have a responsibility to prevent grave dangers from emerging from inside their territory; if they fail to do so, other countries have a right to intervene to forestall the threat. For instance, the Taliban's blatant shirking of its duty to prevent Al Qaeda from launching attacks from Afghanistan prior to 9/11, or to bring them to justice afterward, provided America with the right to use force in self-defense to remove an intolerable danger. Looking ahead, military intervention would be justified if a government with nuclear capacity intended to transfer a nuclear bomb to terrorists, or was unable to stop such a transfer. In such cases, however, given that we would be using force first, we must be certain of our intelligence and the evidence behind it. This principles guide us to our decisions. My opponent says first what business. The U.S. is the soul hegemonic country in the world, it is our business because of us being Hegemonic, that is our survival as Norm Chomsky said. Second as said in the Use of force principles, you have to prevent terroist countries from taking over. They took over Afghanistan and thus was a cause of 9/11.

I do not believe in any shape or form that drugs should be government created and/or taxed. I understand that there are some benefits to VERY SMALL doses of marijuana, which is fine so long as each does is recorded and administered under medical supervision in a hospital to avoid problems. you said: \"I simply ENCOURAGE ADVOCATE AND SUPPORT the facts surrounding drug use, the spiritual and intellectual gain that may come out of drug use, and hope to make the world a better place.\" How are you making the world a better place by encouraging, advocating, and supporting the gain of using drugs? By making this statement, you are supporting drug use. That's like saying, I support the idea that exercise is healthy for you, but I do not support exercising. If you know that something is good for you, than you support it. So you support drug use, maybe not drug ABUSE, but drug use. \"But if you are going to do drugs, at least KNOW what you're getting yourself into and KNOW how it may effect you and those around you.\" While I totally agree with this statement, there are some issues. According to < <URL>... ;, at the end of 2007: Percentage of 8th graders using any illicit drug: 19% Percentage of 10th graders using any illicit drug: 14.6% Percentage of 12th graders using any illicit drug: 29.5% In the 8th grade, you are 13 years old. With all the media and news and sites around the internet, one retains enough to know how harmful drugs can be. They may not know the FULL extent of the harm, but they do know it is harmful. My point in all this is, at 13, 14, or even 18, you KNOW what you are doing. You know that drugs are harming you, but you don't care because you like going on the \"trip\". However, many who maybe want to quit can't because the withdrawal phase is too much to handle for most. So they stay addicts the majority of their lives. Drugs destroy lives, period.

C1: Economic advantage A: Up-front money Pro's claims military crew work \"long hours\". Since he hasn't actually said how many hours this is, I have found the numbers for him. The Bureau of Labor indicates that servicemen often work standard (40 a week) hours (1). This only goes up if deployed on a long mission. My opponent criticizes living in the barracks because they're crowded and offer little privacy. This is just false. According to Rod Powers, most soldiers get their own rooms (2). Additionally, \"Many bases (in all the branches) are converting to more modern dormitories, which include two to four bedrooms with a shared living room and kitchen.\" Increasing in rank also allows soldiers to move off-base for free, which would solve my opponent's Sex disadvantage. This shows that the barracks do maintain a stable quality of life. As before, this means soldiers don't pay a house or utility payment, which can easily amount to an extra $10,000 in saved money each year, plus the $50,000, tax-exempt base pay. B. Indirect money My opponent claims that you can get health insurance and retirement in regular jobs. This is contradicted by the fact that 44 million people have no health insurance and another 38 million have inadequate service (3). Also, only 31% of regular workers get offered a standard retirement pension (4). Contrast this to the military, who gives these benefits to the vast majority of its members and lasts well after they have retired from service. C. Specific advantages Pro says you can use a scholarship to get into college, rather than using the military benefit. Actually, you can use both. Use the military benefit to pay for college, then keep all the scholarship money for yourself, since aid comes in the form of direct cash or credit. Thats thousands more dollars in your pocket. Medical care Pro criticizes military medical care by listing one facility in bad condition. However, this evidence is outdated. The Walter Reed facility he refers to was closed months ago (5). Additionally, the flaws in this facility drew attention from the higher-ups, and in 2007 the Department of Veteran's Affairs ordered a review of over 1,400 military hospitals in an effort to maintain or improve overall quality (6). Medical care is quite improved since my opponent's 2007 link. C2: Employment My opponent writes two paragraphs here but they both use the same argument: Relevant work experience outweighs the veteran's preference when getting a job. This is responded to by my Experience argument under C3, which indicates that those in the military do get practical experience in the field of work, since the military offers training in just about any occupation. This gives them both years of work experience AND veteran's preference, which is basically an instant hire. C3: Personal improvements A. Physical health This point is basically conceded; he's never disputed that virtually everyone in the military gains strong physical conditioning and health. He does say that the \"high risk\" of physical harm (0.1%) outweighs, but this is already responded to. He also says that the average civilian can work out as well to gain strong physique. But according to WebMD Health, over 61% of Americans are overweight (7). So non-military persons don't exercise as much as my opponent thinks. B. Work experience My opponent has conveniently left out his source's info on Preferences, where the jobs the member would like to have are taken into consideration. As far as soldiers sometimes having to go to a job where they are needed, my opponent refutes this himself when he says that this is only for first duty assignments, and afterwards you have much more of a choice of which job you can go to. Pro says there are \"restrictions\" on this, but the only one his source talks about is difficulty getting a job in an overseas base. Getting a job you'd like here in the US is not that hard. Therefore, extend that soldiers will get work experience in the desired field, in addition to Veteran's Preference. This makes achieving one's dream job that much easier. C4: Most people who join the military don't regret it My opponent doesn't actually respond to this point and instead makes new arguments about high suicide and homelessness rates among Vietnam vets. But remember, the US had the draft during Vietnam. One reason the military offers so many benefits today is because its all-volunteer, and needs to give incentives to join. Back during Vietnam, they could just force people to sign up, meaning they didnt have to give good soldier pay, veteran's preference, or any significant benefits to encourage people to join. This contributes to the high rate of homelessness among them today. However, today's military gives so many advantages after discharge that this is a non-issue in current times. Pro brings up that veterans commit suicide at twice the normal rate. Well according to his own source, the actual rate of death is 18.7 per 100,000. This is a 0.02% chance of suicide. The standard rate of suicide is 0.01%, so he's making a big deal over a difference of one hundredth. Remember what this argument is actually about: 91% of Vietnam vets are glad they served in the military. He has dropped the argument that modern support is even higher because the current wars aren't near as horrifying as Vietnam. So we're probably looking at a 95-96% chance that if someone joins the military, they will be glad they did so. This shows that the people actually in the military feel that the benefits do outweigh the harms. Once again, thanks to Pro for this intense and competitive round.

Contrast this to the military, who gives these benefits to the vast majority of its members and lasts well after they have retired from service.  C. Specific advantages  Pro says you can use a scholarship to get into college, rather than using the military benefit. Actually, you can use both. Use the military benefit to pay for college, then keep all the scholarship money for yourself, since aid comes in the form of direct cash or credit. Thats thousands more dollars in your pocket.   Medical care  Pro criticizes military medical care by listing one facility in bad condition. However, this evidence is outdated. The Walter Reed facility he refers to was closed months ago (5). Additionally, the flaws in this facility drew attention from the higher-ups, and in 2007 the Department of Veteran's Affairs ordered a review of over 1,400 military hospitals in an effort to maintain or improve overall quality (6). Medical care is quite improved since my opponent's 2007 link.  C2: Employment  My opponent writes two paragraphs here but they both use the same argument: Relevant work experience outweighs the veteran's preference when getting a job. This is responded to by my Experience argument under C3, which indicates that those in the military do get practical experience in the field of work, since the military offers training in just about any occupation. This gives them both years of work experience AND veteran's preference, which is basically an instant hire.  C3: Personal improvements  A. Physical health  This point is basically conceded; he's never disputed that virtually everyone in the military gains strong physical conditioning and health. He does say that the \"high risk\" of physical harm (0.1%) outweighs, but this is already responded to. He also says that the average civilian can work out as well to gain strong physique. But according to WebMD Health, over 61% of Americans are overweight (7). So non-military persons don't exercise as much as my opponent thinks.   B. Work experience  My opponent has conveniently left out his source's info on Preferences, where the jobs the member would like to have are taken into consideration.  As far as soldiers sometimes having to go to a job where they are needed, my opponent refutes this himself when he says that this is only for first duty assignments, and afterwards you have much more of a choice of which job you can go to. Pro says there are \"restrictions\" on this, but the only one his source talks about is difficulty getting a job in an overseas base. Getting a job you'd like here in the US is not that hard. Therefore, extend that soldiers will get work experience in the desired field, in addition to Veteran's Preference. This makes achieving one's dream job that much easier.  C4: Most people who join the military don't regret it  My opponent doesn't actually respond to this point and instead makes new arguments about high suicide and homelessness rates among Vietnam vets. But remember, the US had the draft during Vietnam. One reason the military offers so many benefits today is because its all-volunteer, and needs to give incentives to join. Back during Vietnam, they could just force people to sign up, meaning they didnt have to give good soldier pay, veteran's preference, or any significant benefits to encourage people to join. This contributes to the high rate of homelessness among them today. However, today's military gives so many advantages after discharge that this is a non-issue in current times.  Pro brings up that veterans commit suicide at twice the normal rate. Well according to his own source, the actual rate of death is 18.7 per 100,000. This is a 0.02% chance of suicide. The standard rate of suicide is 0.01%, so he's making a big deal over a difference of one hundredth.     Remember what this argument is actually about: 91% of Vietnam vets are glad they served in the military. He has dropped the argument that modern support is even higher because the current wars aren't near as horrifying as Vietnam. So we're probably looking at a 95-96% chance that if someone joins the military, they will be glad they did so. This shows that the people actually in the military feel that the benefits do outweigh the harms.   Once again, thanks to Pro for this intense and competitive round.

In centuries past, law officers were afforded more leeway in their application of deadly force [1]. Now that times have changed, law enforcement officers (from here on out will be referred to as LEOs) have more options to incapacitate dangerous suspects.

Some, however, question the use of such force and ask why can't LEOs shoot to wound or disarm instead of killing the person?

I will go through some key points now. =================== CONTENTIONS =================== 1) Requiring the LEO to target a suspect in a manner to wound or disarm requires more reaction time and aim on the part of the LEO, thus allowing the potential for a mistake, a missed shot and a fast reaction on the suspects part. 2) Requiring the LEO to train to aim for limbs, non vital areas of the body and held weapons is a strain on the LEO's training. 3) Deadly force applied to the suspect will stop him.

Spelling and grammar don't seem to have been much of an issue in this debate, so I would recommend a tie.  \n  \r\n3. Con has clearly dominated the arguments, having capitalized on Pro's drops and completely torn down any arguments that he left standing.  \n  \r\n4. Con also receives the 2 points for sources, for not only provided a maelstrom of links, but also for managing to poke holes in the credibility of Pro's evidence, and providing a scenario in which Con would ultimately still come out on top.  \n  \r\nWith 6/7 points going Con, I would again assert, dear Pro, that this debate was over from the beginning. ;)", "category": "Politics", "round": 3, "debate_id": "Capital-Punishment-Is-Justice-Best-Served-Swiftly/1/", "idx": 6408}

Furthermore, when discussing the issue of cutting the deficit in half during his first term, Obama lied when he said, \u201cWe can make sure that everyone gets the health care they need without adding to the deficit.\u201d Clearly, this promise was yet another falsehood from a politician who has proven himself untrustworthy. Finally, regarding Obama\u2019s foreign policy successes, let us remember that he did not achieve these victories alone. He had assistance from around the globe in order to accomplish the tasks outlined above.

However, there are still a few areas where our views differ significantly. Firstly, Pro argues that my use of \u201cfixed\u201d instead of \u201crepeal\u201d was a change in stance. This is incorrect; throughout the entirety of the debate, I have been advocating for a repeal of Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell (DADT). Secondly, Pro states that my argument regarding military readiness is based off of a false premise - that DADT causes harm to military readiness. To the contrary, numerous studies have shown that allowing open service would actually improve military readiness. Finally, Pro suggests that my argument that DADT is a violation of civil rights is flawed due to its focus on individual rights rather than collective rights. However, this misses the point entirely; individuals are part of larger communities, and denying someone their basic human rights violates those rights regardless of whether it happens to an individual or a group.

He claims it should be \"amended,\" but does not explain the content of the amendment or how it would be better than a repeal. 9)An amendment of DADT would not solve any of the problems as well as a repeal. So long as some form of DADT lingers, the military will still be drained of needed personnel, women will still be sexually assaulted and oppressed, and gays will still be harassed.

He claims that the concept of a perfect being is too vague and open ended to provide evidence for such a being existing. He goes on to argue that the idea of a maximally great being is equally problematic since there is no way to prove that such a being actually exists. He concludes that both premises fail due to lack of proof. \nI will begin by addressing Con\u2019s criticism of the notion of perfection. While he is correct in stating that the concept of perfection is subjective and open-ended, this does not mean that the Ontological Argument fails. Rather, it means that the concept of perfection should be interpreted within the context of the argument itself. When defining \u201cmaximally great\u201d being, one must consider the attributes associated with greatness - power, knowledge, goodness, etc. \u2013 and determine whether a being possesses each attribute in the highest degree possible. Thus, while the concept of perfection remains subjective, the criteria used to measure it is objective. Furthermore, the burden of proof lies upon the skeptic to show how a maximally great being cannot exist, rather than the proponent of the argument having to demonstrate that such a being does indeed exist.  \nCon next moves onto attack the second premise of the KCA, claiming that the universe has always existed and thus requires no causation. However, this objection misunderstands the premise, which states that the universe began to exist, not that it has always existed. Additionally, the cosmological argument provides evidence for a transcendent cause outside of space and time, which necessitates a beginning. Without a first cause, the universe would require an infinite amount of time to come into existence, making the origin of the universe impossible. Thus, the cosmological argument supports the conclusion that the universe had a transcendent cause which necessitated a beginning.", "len_content": 1980, "style": "\n### Round 4\n\nRound 4 begins with Con making a few comments about round 3. He says he agrees with me that the burden of proof lies with the affirmative side, however he believes that I did not meet that burden in round 3. He goes on to say that while he understands my argument from desire, he still finds it lacking in substance due to the potential for deception. He argues that the same problem applies to the cosmological argument, since there is always the possibility of a creator creating the universe without any purposeful intent. Finally, he claims that both of my arguments rely too heavily on the idea of faith rather than reasoned evidence. \n\nMy response to Con\u2019s comments is that yes, the burden of proof does lie with the affirmative team. However, I feel like I met that burden in round 3 by presenting logical arguments backed up by sources such as William Lane Craig and Alvin Plantinga. With regards to the argument from desire, I acknowledge that the potential for deception is a real concern, but I argue that it is possible to distinguish between genuine desires and fabricated ones. Furthermore, I don\u2019t see how the cosmological argument faces the same issue when positing a designer who has purposeful intent. Lastly, I disagree that my arguments rely too much on faith - instead, I would argue that they rely on reasoned evidence. For instance, the argument from contingency relies on the premise that everything has a cause, which is a scientific fact. Similarly, the Kalaam Cosmological Argument uses highly technical philosophical reasoning to arrive at its conclusion.

Properly stated, the desire for something more than can be provided by nature speaks of something other-worldly, more specifically, that would be god. Thank you for pointing this out, Mhykiel. Con mentions the theft example and misses the point of it. I was not interested in providing a valid justification for a hypothetical thief, but in illustrating his improper use of the word 'right'. In that capacity, my example stands. In Con's alternative example, a father can justify his belief that his son loves him, but again, this justification does not make that belief true. The son could be deceiving the father intentionally, or the son could be incapable of love and simply going through the motions unaware of this fact, etc. The father's justification of his own belief is not tied to the truth of his belief. It is quite reasonable for a father to believe his son loves him based on a perceived loving nature by the son. On those grounds, his belief is justified even if it is a false belief based on untruth. Con has also stated something I strongly agree with: \"So a \"Justifiable\" beleif is one that can be demonstrated to be pluasiblly true.\" The strength of the 'argument from desire' and the KCA is that they are plausibly true.

Something that exists contingently has (and needs) an explanation of why it exists; after all, its existence is not inevitable. 3.

To repeat this ad infinitum is no explanation of why anything exists at all. 5. Therefore, what explains why contingent beings exist at all can only be a non-contingent being. 6. A non-contingent being is one that exists necessarily, and doesn't need some further explanation for why it exists. 7. This necessary being is God. Premise one states things in the universe are dependent on other things in the universe for their existence. I think we can all agree to that. Premise two is valid. Explanations are readily available to anything we may encounter in our known universe. Premise three and four are self-explanatory. Premise five follows from four.

Throughout this debate, three main points will become evident. One, vegetarianism is a superior diet choice due to its numerous health benefits. Two, vegetarianism is a more ethical diet choice because it reduces animal suffering. Three, veganism is the most sustainable diet choice because it has the smallest environmental footprint. To begin, research shows that plant-based diets are associated with many health benefits including reduced risk of heart disease, certain types of cancer, and obesity. Additionally, going vegetarian can reduce an individual\u2019s carbon footprint significantly compared to omnivorous diets.

It is my hope that the reader and my opponent see the clear advantages to vegetarianism as a more reasonable way of life.

Most foods contain at least some protein. Sources of protein for vegetarians include nuts and seeds, pulses, soya products (tofu, soya milk and textured soya protein such as soya mince), cereals (wheat, oats, and rice). The lack of protein argument is one made up by flesh eaters and is not at all supported by nutritional studies.

They have TORTURED Gazans.   http://middleeast.about.com...  Israel is suppose to \"negotiate\" and make peace with people like this? If this is what they do to Palestinians, their own people, imagine what they do to Israelies. The relevance of this is that if people actually think Israel tortures Paletinians they should look at Hamas first.  \r\nGood luck!", "category": "Politics", "round": 0, "debate_id": "Does-Israel-torture-Palestians/1/", "idx": 10099}

Furthermore, developing renewable energy sources can reduce our reliance on unstable parts of the world for oil imports, thus increasing national security. Finally, renewables can help alleviate poverty in areas where access to traditional energy sources is limited. \n\nOpposition: While renewable energies may seem attractive at first glance, they come with significant drawbacks. For example, renewable energy sources often require vast amounts of land, water, and minerals, leading to increased resource scarcities and potential conflicts. Additionally, renewable energy projects can be expensive and time consuming, requiring substantial capital investments and long construction timescales.

Now, for the debate. To clear up what I meant about undermining the war effort in Iraq, I simply meant that we are trying to establish a well rounded government and economy there before we would pull our troops out. Their economy is based almost strictly on oil. It is true that the United States only receives around 12% ( a little lower) of its oil from the Persian gulf, but we are the largest consumers of oil on the globe, so 12 percent of our oil, is an incredibly huge amount of oil that the Persian gulf gets to export (and crude oil just hit over 100 dollars a barrel). If we were to lead a global energy revolution, leaving crude oil in the dust, what would Iraq do with its economy? Therefore, it is in the American government's interests to make sure that there is some form of oil demand, which perhaps is why we haven't dedicated enough effort to new technologies. Absolutely we hear a lot about new technologies coming around. However, these are in large part not government sponsored. Bio-diesel fuel still uses a lot of oil, pure bio-fuel congeals in cold climates. Solar power in government buildings is a good point, but it is slightly for a different argument, although under the same topic as energy. As far as hydrogen Fuel Cell cars, it is a tremendous idea, yet, the government has yet to step in and help subsidize costs to create a healthy market in such things. This all dates back to the government and lobbyists point that I made, and you agreed with in the opening point. Your fourth point that more hybrid automobiles and higher EPA standards for miles per gallon is a good one. However, the EPA is very very low in context to priority in our budget, and within the EPA's new budget that Bush has just proposed, most of the money goes to guess what? National security (protection of waterways, etc). How much goes towards new technologies? Very little in comparison to everything else. In fact I must point out that if the government was to simply insist that the EPA make the efficiency levels of vehicles to run on a standard 40 MPG, it would entirely remove that previously mentioned 12 percent of oil from the Persian gulf. Why hasn't that been done? Greed, as is the point of my argument, the government being \"in bed\" with big oil and big car lobbyists. The car companies don't want to be regulated, because it will cost them a lot of money. As far as governmental bodies pushing for nuclear power, by bodies I don't know if you meant actual agencies or branches of government pushing for that, because as of now it is mostly on the politicians drawing board, and an election topic, rather than an actual process taking place. To close, it is true that oil is deeply \"ingrained in the veins of this country\", yet the point that isn't made, is that its in the veins of all countries. There is a huge political push for oil to keep the worlds economy booming. I think that the scientists and inventors of this world could have a clean oil free car tomorrow. But the politics of the government has tied up innovation. As far as transferring to something more cost effective, there are other options that would be more cost effective for the consumer, but not for the businessmen. Exxon mobile made 30-40 billion dollars in profit during one quarter of 2007. Is Exxon ready to move away from oil? What about the politicians that might accept some of the political contributions from Exxon? The system is corrupt, and it goes deeper than capabilities.

This all dates back to the government and lobbyists point that I made, and you agreed with in the opening point. Your fourth point that more hybrid automobiles and higher EPA standards for miles per gallon is a good one. However, the EPA is very very low in context to priority in our budget, and within the EPA's new budget that Bush has just proposed, most of the money goes to guess what? National security (protection of waterways, etc). How much goes towards new technologies? Very little in comparison to everything else. In fact I must point out that if the government was to simply insist that the EPA make the efficiency levels of vehicles to run on a standard 40 MPG, it would entirely remove that previously mentioned 12 percent of oil from the Persian gulf. Why hasn't that been done? Greed, as is the point of my argument, the government being \"in bed\" with big oil and big car lobbyists. The car companies don't want to be regulated, because it will cost them a lot of money. As far as governmental bodies pushing for nuclear power, by bodies I don't know if you meant actual agencies or branches of government pushing for that, because as of now it is mostly on the politicians drawing board, and an election topic, rather than an actual process taking place. To close, it is true that oil is deeply \"ingrained in the veins of this country\", yet the point that isn't made, is that its in the veins of all countries. There is a huge political push for oil to keep the worlds economy booming. I think that the scientists and inventors of this world could have a clean oil free car tomorrow.

To clear up what I meant about undermining the war effort in Iraq, I simply meant that we are trying to establish a well rounded government and economy there before we would pull our troops out. Their economy is based almost strictly on oil. It is true that the United States only receives around 12% ( a little lower) of its oil from the Persian gulf, but we are the largest consumers of oil on the globe, so 12 percent of our oil, is an incredibly huge amount of oil that the Persian gulf gets to export (and crude oil just hit over 100 dollars a barrel). If we were to lead a global energy revolution, leaving crude oil in the dust, what would Iraq do with its economy? Therefore, it is in the American government's interests to make sure that there is some form of oil demand, which perhaps is why we haven't dedicated enough effort to new technologies.  \r\nAbsolutely we hear a lot about new technologies coming around. However, these are in large part not government sponsored. Bio-diesel fuel still uses a lot of oil, pure bio-fuel congeals in cold climates.

Next, I will point out that my opponent has conceded his John example.

Thus, a major point, that has been CONCEDED. Another point I made was \"John is devoted to his country, as seen through desire for good, and inferred action (voting) to try and bring about that good. In short, he is loving and devoting himself to his country, in his own little way. John here is actually a patriot, not a terrorist. If you think John is good, than I win.\" Two points in here.

Unless my opponent would like to contend that voting is bad, he has CONCEDED another essential point. The second point in that quote is that if John is seen as good, then I win. In CONCEDING the John example, he shows that he views John as good, and also by CONCEDING the John example he CONCEDES that if he thinks John is good, I WIN. Thus, I WIN. Now, moving on to his other points. \"This is based upon your earlier quote by Aristotle. And just because he said it, it's correct?\" He supports it logically, in the basic way I support patriotism. This means voting, and he supports it by saying that if we don't vote, we aren't helpful to our nation. \"The rest of his argument stems from the line, 'if no one cares about their country...' and like I said earlier you can care about your country without being patriotic.

The way you care about the Superbowl in this case is simply having an interest in knowing about the outcome, or having patriotism towards a favorite team. For example, I cared about the Superbowl between the Steelers and the Seahawks because I am a patriot for the Ravens, and I want the Steelers to fail as they are my enemies. So, in fact, it could be due to patriotism, or it could be curiosity in the outcome. Just because I go to cnn.com to find out about the Georgian war does not mean I care at all about Georgia.

I agree to the debate parameters that he has proposed. I will now demonstrate that the Christian God is contradictory in nature according to the Bible. =========================== The Christian God is Inconsistent in Nature =========================== The God of the Bible self-proclaims that he is synonymous with love (1 John 4:8) and the God of peace (Romans 15:33). However, the Bible describes him committing countless atrocities that could hardly be considered peaceful, loving, or good. Not only are his actions contradictory to his self-proclaimed nature, but his own words are inconsistent. He says he is the God of peace, yet he also proclaims himself \"a man of war\" (Exodus 15:3). Peace is clearly antithetical to war, and he also calls himself a man, which is contradictory to his claim that he is God. ===================== Atrocities Committed by Yahweh ===================== I will list some of the notable atrocities by Yahweh. He has killed (directly and indirectly) 2,391,421 people as specifically described in the Bible, and including the flood, around 33,000,000 total. - Yahweh destroys the entire global population. \"Every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.\" - Genesis 7:4 - Yahweh kills 50,070 men for looking into the ark of God. \"And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.\" - 1 Samuel 6:19 - Yahweh sends an angel to kill 185,000 sleeping men. \"The angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.\" - 2 Kings 19:35 - Yahweh destroys 1,000,000 starving Ethiopians. \"The LORD smote the Ethiopians\" - 2 Chronicles 14:12 Given all of these atrocities, it would be be absurd to proclaim that Yahweh is peaceful, loving, and good. And if you claim that he is only peaceful and loving sometimes, then that negates that he is omnibenevolent, a common attribute of the Christian God. If one is to say that God is good because he declares himself the moral standard and because all that he does is good, then that is circular reasoning. Merely asserting that everything you do is good, is not enough to make such a claim true, even within the confines of a Biblical framework. ========= Closing Quote ========= I will leave you with this closing quote which eloquently describes the Christian God's contradictory nature. \"... A God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell - mouths mercy and invented hell - mouths Golden Rules, and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him!\" - Mark Twain ======= Conclusion ======= In conclusion, I have affirmed the resolution that the God of the Bible is inconsistent in nature.

However, I will continue to argue my side of the case with enthusiasm and a no-quitting attitude, as dswd has done. I shall make some connections that I have failed to state, thus causing the Pro not to explain Re:Con 3) in the previous argument. Here it is: 1) I am not saying that scientists are wrong, or that I am using holy books as scientific sources. I am saying, however, that the opposing side only has science and evidence to back up the dswd's argument. In my previous argument, I stated and made known inevitable that if the big bang theory was true (science says it is) then humans could not have evolved. See, I have just used science to prove that humans did not evolve, despite all the \"evidence\". See point 2. I have also used something other than science, even though this debate is primarily about science (this shows my lack of experience, so I apologize for anything wrong), I have also used logical reasoning and divine words. Again, I'm not saying I'm right and scientists are wrong, but logically a god would seem to know more than a scientist (even if it is 97% of them), and certainly a divine creator (God?) could possibly be more correct than scientists, probably because he created them. I shall prove that the bible is correct so that I can use it as a temporary scientific source, since this is a science debate. 2) If scientists prove that the BB theory is correct, then they also unknowingly prove that there is a divine creator (see my previous argument where I prove that the BB theory proves that there is a supreme creator) and the bible is correct. I know the bible has a lot of errors, but that is because people changed it long ago. If the bible is correct (see my other arguments), then science proves that evolution is not possible. I used the bible as a science source. 3) Take a look at point 2 in the opponent's last argument. \"if one takes a look at the series of skulls in that stem from different types of humans and apes it is nearly impossible to draw a clear line and distinguish humans from apes\".

I shall make some connections that I have failed to state, thus causing the Pro not to explain Re:Con 3) in the previous argument. Here it is: 1) I am not saying that scientists are wrong, or that I am using holy books as scientific sources. I am saying, however, that the opposing side only has science and evidence to back up the dswd's argument. In my previous argument, I stated and made known inevitable that if the big bang theory was true (science says it is) then humans could not have evolved. See, I have just used science to prove that humans did not evolve, despite all the \"evidence\". See point 2. I have also used something other than science, even though this debate is primarily about science (this shows my lack of experience, so I apologize for anything wrong), I have also used logical reasoning and divine words. Again, I'm not saying I'm right and scientists are wrong, but logically a god would seem to know more than a scientist (even if it is 97% of them), and certainly a divine creator (God?) could possibly be more correct than scientists, probably because he created them. I shall prove that the bible is correct so that I can use it as a temporary scientific source, since this is a science debate. 2) If scientists prove that the BB theory is correct, then they also unknowingly prove that there is a divine creator (see my previous argument where I prove that the BB theory proves that there is a supreme creator) and the bible is correct. I know the bible has a lot of errors, but that is because people changed it long ago. If the bible is correct (see my other arguments), then science proves that evolution is not possible. I used the bible as a science source. 3) Take a look at point 2 in the opponent's last argument. \"if one takes a look at the series of skulls in that stem from different types of humans and apes it is nearly impossible to draw a clear line and distinguish humans from apes\". Scientists say they found skulls, and i know there are pictures, but has anyone ever seen one besides the important people? (sorry, i'm in a hurry right now)", "len_style": 2796, "ideology-content": "\nArgument: (I understand why you may think this way, but let me try to convince you otherwise.) The idea that humans cannot evolve due to the big bang theory is incorrect; the big bang theory does not disprove human evolution. Furthermore, the fact that scientists disagree on certain aspects of the big bang theory should demonstrate that it is far from proven. Additionally, while the big bang theory might suggest that God exists, it does not necessarily follow that He must exist. Therefore, we cannot rely solely upon the big bang theory to support our views on creation.", "len_ideology-content": 576, "ideology-style": "\nArgument transformed into an effective argument: \nI want to apologize for not making certain points clear earlier. I chose science as the topic, but I have been arguing as if it were religion. To counter this, I will use my religious arguments against your scientific ones - if that\u2019s okay. Here\u2019s what I said previously: DSWD, you have made a strong opposition argument and I truly admire your debating skills and beliefs. But I will still vigorously defend my stance with enthusiasm and a \u201cno quitting\u201d attitude, like DSWD has done. Now, let me connect some dots which I couldn\u2019t mention before due to time constraints. Firstly, I\u2019m not claiming that scientists are incorrect; rather, I\u2019m stating that the opposing side relies on science alone while neglecting other forms of proof such as logic and scripture. For example, if the Big Bang Theory is true (as science claims), then human evolution becomes impossible \u2013 something I mentioned previously without fully explaining why. This is because the two theories contradict each other. Secondly, I\u2019m utilizing logical reasoning and divine words to support my argument, again something I didn\u2019t get to discuss thoroughly before. For instance, if God exists and He is the Creator, then His word must be infallible and more reliable than any scientist\u2019s opinion. Finally, I will demonstrate how the Bible is accurate and therefore, evolution cannot occur \u2013 something science fails to account for.

Freedom is arguably the greatest possession of anyone, more valuable in itself than any security. It allows the individual to reach his or her potential, or be able to express their emotions passively without fear of pain or imprisonment. Freedom is an inherently good thing. Anarchy also stands against the power of an individual over other people. This relationship is often exploitative, as power corrupts. It rots a person, and tempts them to abuse what power they have. Such a hierarchy has been shown time and time again to fail us as a whole. And whereabouts on such a hierarchy is the most power based? In the State, naturally. How can a State abuse its power? By enforcing controlling laws and taxes that make the people suffer. While democracy claims that the people have a say in how they are governed, it is too often a decision between two or more undesirable parties, and once a party is elected, the people must settle with the decision made until the next election, in which time they may be imprisoned by a power driven State that denies the people freedom of expression. So what is the answer to this restrictive force? Anarchy.

Vote for the Instigator.", "label": 0, "author": "Cloud", "original_text": "\n  \r\n\"When there is state there can be no freedom, but when there is freedom there will be no state.\" Lenin  \r\nUltimately, Anarchy comes down to the freedom of the individual. Freedom is arguably the greatest possession of anyone, more valuable in itself than any security. It allows the individual to reach his or her potential, or be able to express their emotions passively without fear of pain or imprisonment. Freedom is an inherently good thing.  \r\nAnarchy also stands against the power of an individual over other people. This relationship is often exploitative, as power corrupts. It rots a person, and tempts them to abuse what power they have. Such a hierarchy has been shown time and time again to fail us as a whole. And whereabouts on such a hierarchy is the most power based? In the State, naturally.  \r\nHow can a State abuse its power? By enforcing controlling laws and taxes that make the people suffer. While democracy claims that the people have a say in how they are governed, it is too often a decision between two or more undesirable parties, and once a party is elected, the people must settle with the decision made until the next election, in which time they may be imprisoned by a power driven State that denies the people freedom of expression.  \r\nSo what is the answer to this restrictive force? Anarchy. Not the scary unshaven Anarchy that the State would have you fear, but a fair system in which we discuss, co-operate, negotiate and barter in peace on a local level. Such a system is the way forward.  \r\nSo if you believe in peace, harmony, equality and liberty, I can be confident that you will vote for Anarchy.

I'm even against birth control, because I believe that a child is a child when it is conceived. But if elected president I will not ban abortion, the only laws that I'll push forward is that the child must have permission from their parents in order to have the abortion. Also if the father leaves her we'll have him join the military for getting the women pregent. \n  2. Gay Marriage I'm against gay marriage, but this is one position that I won't touch if I'm elected. I personal believe it is morally wrong, but this is a topic to be left up to each individual state via the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  3. Voting Rights this is an area that action must be taken. Many states still have hundreds of dead people registered to vote and the death of that person should automatically take them off the registered list.\n  4. Foreign Policy Iran and Israel- We need to make sure Iran doesn't get the nuclear weapon, however, the status quo still isn't working. To more correctly answer the question if I get called by the Israeli Minister and they say their jets are going to bomb Iran. I would say, \"We're right behind you.\" We must support Israel since it is our greatest ally. Iran must be stopped, but only if they continue to go against the United States. As a matter of fact Iran has been at war with the U.S. since 1977 through the declaration in their constitution, but Congress hasn't recognized it so it isn't a full war... yet. Syria- We must help the rebels, but we can't do this until they have identified themselves. Until then we must continue cleaning up around the area such as Jordan, and Turkey. North Korea- North Korea is a nation lost in the dark, but my question is why the U.S. take action against them hasn\"t since they are attempting to get nuclear weapons. We must at the minimum put a global embargo on North Korea. \n  5. Welfare & Social Security Welfare- First off it might come as a surprise to you, but I'm not going to abolish or even cut welfare. I'm going to have required that the people in receiving welfare must participate in community service or fill out at least 10 applications a month. Social Security- I believe social security should be abolished. For the reason that people should be able to control their own retirement and not leave it in the hands of Wall St. sharks and the greedy government. \n  6. Drones I believe that the use of drones is great and that the U.S. should continue to use such technology. It keeps our brave soldiers out of harm\"s way instead of killing them in a hostile environment. \n  7. Deficit Today the government is in debt over $16 trillion dollars and it\"s growing by the second. We must do something now or our children will be stuck in a world of hurt because we\"re here spending like crazy. Now what I propose the government does is that we go back to the ideals of Alexander Hamilton. We pay back some of our debt and get it back to the pre-Bush era, but don\"t pay it all back. We could easily start by stop importing large amounts of oil from the Middle East and instead get most of our oil from the motherland, right here at home. We can use the money saved from oil to help pay back debt and more. The U.S. should implement Platinum coins but don\"t distribute them to the public, but distribute them to China and other nations to pay off our debt in order to avoid inflation. \n  8.

Gun violence varies greatly from one region to another; some areas have higher crime rates than others, meaning that certain states may require stricter laws on firearms while other states may be more lax.

First, the Great Depression was long ago, so this is no longer relevant; your source says that was the purpose, implying that it is not the purpose today.

You say that minimum wage laws aren't directed at reducing poverty. This is incorrect. In his 2013 State of the Union Address, Obama supported raising the Federal Minimum Wage by arguing that full-time workers shouldn't have to be poor: \" [L]et's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.\" The Employment Policies Institute also calls the minimum wage \" a program intended to reduce poverty. \" (my 4th source from Round 2) You say minimum wage laws don't entitle the unemployed to reaping benefits, but that's kind of a strawman because I never argued that they do. You also say that minimum wage laws \" specifically target \" workers to make sure they have the wages required \" to live and be in satisfactory health. \" First, let me point out that this is basically saying that reducing poverty is a primary goal of minimum wage laws, which contradicts one of your earlier statements. Second, I've already demonstrated that minimum wage laws do an awful job at targeting . If you look back to the previous round, I referenced a study which showed that increases the Federal Minimum Wage from 2007-2009 targeted those who were already well above the poverty threshold! If a primary goal of minimum wages is to protect workers from wages that are below what is \" required to live and be in satisfactory health \", than it is immensly wasteful. This is just another reason to support abolishment. My opponent cited the minimum wage and unemployment rate of San Fracisco, California. Since he didn't base any argument on these statistics, I'm still wondering why he posted them... \" Historically, minimum wage has been increased in the United States on multiple occasions. Each time, people argued that raising it would be catastrophic - however, decades later, the United States still has the largest GDP in the world.\" This appears to be another strawman. I never argued that minimum wage laws are \" catastrophic, \" nor that they must be to warrant their abolishment.

However people undervalue these and what I mean by that is that if these goods/services cost they wouldn't be bought by everybody. \nA few examples come to mind for example, education. It is free but some people wouldn't buy it if it did cost. So, the costs to the government or the nation as a whole. \nThe welfare state costs an awful lot of money to the government, peoples hard earned income is being distributed to some people who claim to have a disability or in desperate need of income but in actual fact are taking advantage of this badly formed concept and claiming benefits they don't need.  \nAlso I believe some people may be overlooked by the government when they do meet the criteria to gain these benefits because the background search of some people is not thorough enough. This has become a problem as a lot of people have discovered this \u2018loophole\u2019 and are taking advantage of it. \nThe alternatives to the welfare state include increasing the role of the voluntary sector. This means making people responsible for other people and caring for each other as a community. This may not seem like it would work but I believe a system could be put in place so everyone has to contribute to the community. \nI also believe some adjustments could be made to the welfare state such as making it universal although this does have its drawbacks. \nIn conclusion I think everyone should play a bigger role in shaping our community and caring for the elderly and the unable instead of just giving them a bit of money in which the government expect them to know what to use it for.", "len_ideology-style": 1918, "all": "\nArgument: I believe the Welfare state, the government rule giving benefits to those in need of support through benefit payments and services, is outdated and in need of a replacement. \nFirst of all, the welfare state is about merit goods \u2013\u2013 goods that give significant benefits to the individual consuming them and to society as a whole. However, people often underestimate these goods and what I mean by that is that if these goods/services cost, then not everyone will purchase them. For instance, education. It\u2019s free, yet some people might not purchase it if it were to cost. As a result, the costs to the government (or the nation as a whole) can be immense. Furthermore, the welfare state costs an enormous amount of money to the government, individuals\u2019 hard-earned income is being redistributed to some people who claim to have a disability or in dire need of income, but in reality are abusing this poorly constructed idea and fraudulently claiming benefits that they don\u2019t actually require. Additionally, some people may go unnoticed by the government when they do fulfill the criteria to receive these benefits due to the insufficient background checks performed. This has become a major issue as many people have found this \u201cloophole\u201d and are exploiting it. \nAlternatives to the welfare state include increasing the involvement of the volunteer sector. This entails having people take responsibility for one another and forming communities.

Obviously, in this debate, Pro did not refute whatever I say in the previous round. Pro is going with his own definition of God that is Omnipotence. He says that an Omnipotence being can do anything yes I must admit that. But not a being with Omnipotence, Omni benevolence and Omniscience. I will illustrate this example in order to clear the confusion of the readers. God =Omni benevolence =Omnipotence =Omniscience Evil =Omnipotence =Omniscience (Possibly) =Malevolence Being X or whatever you want to call that (Not God or Evil) = Omnipotence Pro is claiming that being X has free will because it can do anything. Yes. But do you think being X is really God? As I have stated in my earlier round that God cannot sin since he is Omnibenevolent. Yes, what I say is true and valid because my opponent also admits that. He has no objection. He is claiming that the being X has free will. He also drops that God does not have free will because he has only one choice. He says that Omnipotent being can drop his attributes to become being X and have free will. Let\"s us look at this further. Carbon Dioxide- CO2. Oxygen-O2 Carbon-C He is trying to ask carbon dioxide to release its Oxygen then it will become free. So, only C is left. He is trying to say that C is carbon dioxide. No, that is carbon. He is trying to falsely equivocate whatever Omnipotent being is God. 2. I have explained that God cannot have free will because free will is described as the ability to act in one\"s freedom because God is powerful. Unfortunately, my opponent has no refuted the possibility that God was prevented by evil to do something. Since he also admits the Holy Bible is true, which means evil also exists. We can see that in this debate, the only reference that we use is Holy Bible but not any other books. 3. I have, again, proven that the creator (God) of free will did not have free will. If HE has given any human free will which means the man can act bad or good. He has no control over. HE is also predestined by its own knowledge of its future actions. Which means God has no free will because of he knows what HE will do in the future. If he does not do it, then he will be wrong. 4. Pro says that I have dropped his case and remains un-rebutted. Is that true? No, because whatever Con is irrelevant to the debate. It is no value for me to attack that. A few mistakes that I make are that misplace the order of the position of Creation in the Genesis. In the beginning, I define God as Omnipotence, Omni benevolence and Omniscience. I did not define him as Omnipotence alone. 5. Free will: The ability to do something\". If God has free will, then he can do it. If God has no free will then he cannot do it. In my parts, God has no power to act because of the cancellation of power. Just to remind the readers that Evils are Angels before. That said, they are also powerful and almost same as God. 6. Pro is also debating truism. This means he is having all the advantages and I was set in a bad position. Onto the voters now, we, on the whole, have seen that Pro is dropping whatever I say in my rounds. He is trying to change the properties of God in order to let the free will works. But, after all, the being is no longer God. He has not met with his burden of proof to show that God really has free will to do something which I specifically ask.

First off, I want to address my opponent\u2019s concern regarding my reliance on personal experiences. While I understand why one might feel that way, I believe that personal experiences can provide valuable insight into debates which cannot necessarily be gained through logical reasoning alone. In regards to my argument about \u201cwomen being better suited\u201d to caregiving roles, I provided evidence from multiple sources including scientific studies which demonstrate that there are indeed biological differences between men and women which contribute to their differing abilities in terms of physical strength, endurance and even cognitive skills related to multitasking. This evidence suggests that women are naturally better equipped to handle many of the demands of parenthood and therefore should be afforded greater respect and recognition for their contributions. Furthermore, while my opponent attempts to downplay the importance of social attitudes by saying that \u201call factors take place outside of our control\u201d, the fact remains that collectively, our actions DO shape the world around us. Social attitudes certainly CAN and often ARE influenced by external forces, whether those be cultural norms, media messages, peer pressure or otherwise. To suggest that these influences are insignificant is na\u00efve.   Finally, I disagree with my opponent\u2019s assertion that my views on gender equality represent a \u201cdisruptive attitude\u201d. Gender equality IS the default state of humanity - it is the natural order. The patriarchy which exists in many parts of the world today is the result of centuries of oppressive systems designed to keep women subjugated.

This runs counter to the notion that humans possess unique individual autonomy and agency. In fact, research suggests that individual decision-making can be influenced by cultural values and norms, even among those who consider themselves highly independent and autonomous. For example, studies show that exposure to gender roles can shape men\u2019s and women\u2019s behavior regardless of whether or not they identify with traditional gender roles. Additionally, research shows that even when people believe they are making decisions independently, their choices are often influenced by subtle cues from their environment.

If these adults are affected by egalitarian additudes, then it's their choice to let these things affect their relationship. My opponents acceptance of a \"natural order\" seems to be a more disruptive additude than egalitarian or feminist additudes. When people use phrases like \"natural order\", what they're really doing is denying that social attitudes change or progress at all, and they label any shifts in additudes as deviance.

For example, one could argue that since the probability of collision is low, insurance policies could be put in place to cover any losses due to collisions. Similarly, governments could enact laws prohibiting certain activities in space, such as creating or leaving debris behind. These measures could help reduce the chances of accidents occurring in orbit. Additionally, technological advancements could also be made to improve tracking systems and detect incoming debris.

In fact, even when accounting for the most optimal effects, we would need to wait at least 30 more years before beginning a large attempt at adopting space based solar power. In order for SBSP to be feasible before then, we would require some sort of disruptive technology in orbital launch, such as a space elevator. Another case might be where the Earth's atmosphere suddenly prevented more of the sunlight from reaching the Earth, increasing the efficiency gains from using SBSP. ----SBSP tech won't be available for years. Skarb 09 (Justin Skarb, staff writer for the spacereview.com, written Jan. 16, 2009, <URL>... , accessed Dec. 6, 2011, AL) The danger in making large investments into SBSP while the economy is reeling is that there is only so much money to go around. As such, there is a danger that scarce investment dollars will be siphoned way from more immediately viable and beneficial programs such as terrestrial green energy programs. Some three decades ago the Department of Energy reported in its review of SBSP that \"every dollar spent on solar satellites will not be spent on terrestrial research and commercialization\". Unfortunately, it is these very programs that may be critical to preventing a deepening of the current economic crisis. It would be nothing less than a tragedy of political judgment if the country was forced to forgo the near-term economic benefits of terrestrial green energy programs simply to fund a SBSP program that will not be viable for years, if not decades. ----Even discounting most costs even after 30 years you don't even have 15% back in profit Mok 11 (Brian Mok, CEO at Takezawa, written July 2, 2011, <URL>... , accessed Dec. 6, 2011, AL) Using data from previous studies and our own linearized estimations, we are able to obtain a chart for annual returns on investment. This only supposes that the only cost incurred are putting solar panels up in space. All other costs are completely ignored, such as fixed costs, capital costs, etc. Even the costs of putting up a transmitting array, or construction is ignored. In other words, the costs shown here are similar to marginal costs, if all the space and ground infrastructure was already set up. We are only looking at \"when is it even remotely feasible to begin thinking about SBSP as a mainstream source of energy.\" We see from the graph that in fact, for a median estimate, even waiting thirty year is not enough to reach a 15% return. Since we are discounting the roughly 80% of the costs from other sources, 15% is the minimum to begin considering SBSP. ----SBSPs causes Kessler Syndrome Dutt 11 (Varun Dutt, Post-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, <URL>... , written Oct. 10, 2011, accessed Nov. 28, 2011, AL) According to a recent NASA report, the space around earth is home to over 135 million small pieces of junk; another 300,000 medium size pieces (between 1 and 10 centimeters); and over 22,000 significant pieces of trash (over 10 centimeters across).

If you look at the overall homework structure in middle school and high school you realize the that bulk of the homework comes from four classes: Math, Science, History, and English. Other classes such as PE, art, and other \"elective\" classes have very little homework. By spending an extra two hours in school everyday we would be extending the schedule of every class not just the ones where homework is an issue. This would actually increase the time spent in school and on homework because we would still have the same amount of work from all classes but an increased time spent classes where extra time is not needed.  \n  \r\nNow to tackle your second point. You mention that homework is being assigned to first graders and that their homework is silly and pointless. If you refer to my opening statement you will see that I have already agreed with you on this point.  \r\n\"Is homework immoral in some cases? Yes. Homework is immoral when it is assigned just to give a student homework and not to reinforce material that was presented earlier in the day. In this case homework interferes with a child's outside of school development as well as time spent socializing and interacting with peers and family members.\"  \r\nPointless and silly homework is useless and does interrupt the developmental process of young children. From the way we have structured our arguments, however, I think we can both agree that our argument lies in middle school and high school and not in the lower graders (3rd grade and below).  \n  \r\nSummer homework, how I remember the days. I had to do homework over the summer for a few years and it was because I was taking advanced placement classes. I had elected to take the responsibility of completing these assignments because I was interested in taking these advanced placement classes. Never for any \"regular\" class did I have summer homework. May I ask what class you have summer homework for? Is it because you are taking an AP/Honors class or perhaps because you are at a private school that requires summer work? While I do feel your pain of having to write five 800 word essays over the summer I fail to see how someone of your intelligence has difficulty completing these in under 2-3 hours. You are in the 8th grade, taking college level and high school level courses. Based on this evidence I should easily be able to assume that you write at the level of a high school junior or senior. Each round of the debate we are writing right now easily approaches 500 words. This particular round should almost approach 800 words and it has taken me only 30 minutes in the middle of my Econ 370 class to write.  \n  \r\nMost people will always learn more on their own than they will in school but, it is the content of the education that matters. School is a structured environment in which a student learns the basic skills and knowledge of life. The skills learned in school and through homework help to make a student an educated and productive member of society. Homework, while it may seem over demanding and pointless is teaching you more than you think.  \n  \r\n-Nate  \n  \r\nP.S. sorry for any typos if there are any.

{"basic": "10. 2. Arguments against the resolution:\n        - Rape is never acceptable under any circumstances, regardless of context or motivation. Therefore, victims cannot be held responsible for their own victimization.\n        - Even when perpetrated by strangers, rape is often linked to other forms of violence against women, including intimate partner violence, stalking, and sexual harassment. These crimes are all interconnected and stem from a culture of male entitlement and privilege.\n        - Women (and men) should not be expected to alter their behavior or dress differently in order to prevent rape. Instead, society needs to focus on holding perpetrators accountable and creating social change that addresses the root causes of rape.", "len_basic": 741, "len_orig": 3348, "ideology": "\nArgument: \nI would like to thank my opponent and Hldemi for his many comments which have also helped me to raise some points I don't think I would have done otherwise.

Most women have a similar attitude towards rape; they just blame the person who commits the crime so they can continue being irresponsible even though their lack of responsibility creates this problem. If you cause something then you deserve what you cause. Everyone has a responsibility; no-one is invulnerable. I have shown that most women are irresponsible or selfish, e.g. they do not care whether innocent people suffer the same thing they say they oppose.

Fracking should not be restricted as it is not harmful to the environment, and it is much more friendly to the earth than traditional drilling.  \n                              \nEnergy is necessary for life. Therefore it is important to get this energy efficiently and with minimal environmental impacts, currently fracking is the answer to that. It allows for a small footprint, and minimized negative effects of the earth. Studies performed by scientists and seismologists have proven multiple times that fracking does not cause earthquakes and never has, The cause found by researchers was that it is from wastewater injection wells, not fracking itself. So the question should not be \u201cWe should stop fracking because it causes earthquakes\u201d but rather it should be \u201cHow can we most safely dispose of our wastewater injection fluids?\u201d Drinking water is also not contaminated by fracking, as previously stated, fracking happens well below the water table, more than a mile underground. Fracking does not cause the climate to change, climate change is simply used as a scare factor to promote political agendas.

A Universal Currency Would Solve Dishonest Trade Tactics First of all, as the article points out, China is not suppressing its currency: \"But there is little evidence the central bank is intervening on a large scale to suppress the value of the renminbi... The renminbi has been under downward pressure because Chinese businesses and households have been moving more money out of the country to diversify their investments and hedge against the possibility of a political change at home.\"[2] In fact, \"When a boom goes bust, devaluing currency is the least bad way for governments to rein in wages and prices that are suddenly too high. But if you use the same currency as another country that isn't in dire straits, good luck convincing them to accept devaluation on your nation's behalf.\"[3] There's nothing really wrong with devaluing a currency to get out of an economic recession. Finally, I see no correlation in dishonest stockmarket tactics and many currencies after reading his two articles (well reading the abstract of the first one). I ask my opponent give more information on this supposed correlation. III. A Universal Currency Would Encourage Cultural Diffusion I admit, it is a hassle to go to another country and have to use a different currency. However, it's not the end of the world. It's easy to get Sweden's currency made into Norway's (as long as you are in either country). These days, currency \"vending machines\" are everywhere. It is easier than ever to change your dollars into, say, Euros. Next, it is also not that big of a hassle to use money in other countries. Every time I have traveled, I have had such an easy time getting currency that I wouldn't even consider it a hassle. It's a price we have to pay for having the right to dictate our own economy in the ever-globalizing world. And with that globalization, it has become easier than ever to get the currency you need at the proper exchange rate. A universal currency would not encourage cultural diffusion any more than we already have it. IV. A Universal Currency Would Encourage Equality I don't understand why my opponent thinks that we cannot clearly see another countries' standard of living and classify people on a global scale because of separate currencies. All you have to do is divide a countries' GDP by its population and translate that value into the currency you want through exchange rates. We do it for all countries. And again, I don't understand why my opponent thinks that we cannot see that the US is better off overall than many countries. We don't need a global currency to see that. That's what GDP percapita statistics are for. In fact, by putting the world under a universal currency, it will harm smaller economies that have not taken off yet by disallowing them from devaluating their currency to expand their economy, thus making the gap bigger. Conclusion While presenting a solid case, my opponent has several fallacies in his case. For example, many of his sources only back up half or less of his argument. For example, his sources 4 and 5 mention various forms of dishonest stock market tactics, but do not attribute it to separate currencies. My opponent has never proven that point, and several other points in that fashion. He also contains a few fallacies where he thinks a universal currency will help promote equality. One, he hasn't proven that a universal currency will help us see our position in the world better, and he hasn't proven why a universal currency would promote equality in the first place. I even showed how a universal currency harms equality. Not one of his arguments that even make sense hold a candle in comparison to countries being able to dictate their own economic-policies; not a one-size-fits-all policy that will screw up most countries under it.

Firstly, he claims that \u201cUnder God\u201d implies only one specific religious belief which is monotheistic faith. However, this is not true since the clause also applies to those who follow pantheist or deist views. Secondly, he argues that the inclusion of \u201cUnder God\u201d makes the Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because it imposes a certain type of religious belief onto others. But again, this is incorrect since the clause does not specify any particular religion but instead leaves room for multiple interpretations. Finally, he states that the phrase \u201cUnder God\u201d goes against judicial consistency because it violates the establishment clause. However, this claim is unfounded since the Supreme Court has already ruled that the phrase \u201cUnder God\u201d does not violate the establishment clause.

With advancements such as social media, video calls, email, and other forms of digital communication, people are now able to connect with each other from opposite ends of the world with ease. This allows us to build relationships, collaborations, and communities across borders, cultures, languages, and time zones. We can share our ideas, knowledge, and experiences with others, gain new perspectives, and work together towards common goals. Furthermore, technology has made it easier for individuals to access vital resources such as education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. By connecting people around the globe, technology is helping to break down barriers, reduce inequality, and create a more unified world. \n\nCounterargument: No, technology is not making us more connected. Despite its advantages, technology also has drawbacks. It can lead to increased levels of isolation, depression, addiction, and distraction. People may become more disconnected from reality and each other due to excessive screen time. Additionally, technological advances often widen existing gaps between those who have access to new tools and those who don\u2019t.

Atheists lack a belief in gods, while agnostics are unsure whether gods exist or not. Both atheists and agnostics reject religious dogma and often use reason and evidence to support their views. Therefore, both atheists and agnostics can be considered nonreligious. Furthermore, scientific theories have been used to explain natural phenomena throughout history, long before the advent of modern science.

Similarly, patriotism is a feeling of deep devotion to one\u2019s country, but again lacks the necessary elements required to classify it as a religion.

Then Con claims \"Pro is making a claim about existence\" and thus concludes \"Therefore Pro exists\". This is...also correct.  \n  \r\nThat's right--I don't challenge these statements. However, here is my argument:  \n  \r\nThese statements in no way help Con's case. For it is not Con's job to prove that Pro exists but to prove that \"I\" exists. After-all, the definition of I is \"The entity who started this debate.\".

{"basic": "\nArgument: \nI'd like to thank Pro for the opportunity to debate the topic at hand. Nietzche is certainly an interesting figure and left a formidable legacy to be overcome.

What Nietzsche meant was not that God was some mortal who had literally been murdered or died, but that the concept of God was becoming less and less necessary as a grounding for our understanding of the world and for things like ethics, meaning, and knowledge. Nietzsche saw that this had left a growing gap in society wherein people now had to look elsewhere for the answers to life's problems.  \nWhile this doctrine has huge implications for the future of society and philosophy, Nietzsche's solution to the problem was necessarily incomplete (as is generally the case with path breakers i.e., Aristotle's logic and cosmology). \nNietzsche's 'God is dead' pronouncement had lasting effects on the development of philosophy and had a direct causal influence on the formation of schools of thought which attempted to solve the problem of dealing with human alienation and whether secular values could be supplanted in religion's place. \nExistentialism and absurdism are among the most known of the proposed solutions with Albert Camus being the founder of the latter. \nThe basic point in Absurdism is emphasis on what is termed the Absurd, the conflict between man's search for meaning in the universe and the apparent lack of any such thing.

With regards to the points raised in your initial post, I believe we can agree that the Big Bang Theory is still evolving and being tested.

Additionally, I don\u2019t think anyone would argue against the notion that the Big Bang occurred \u2013 instead, the focus should remain on understanding exactly what happened during the event and how it impacts our lives today. Finally, I disagree with your assertion that the Big Bang is \u201cunfounded\u201d due to the potential flaws in the current model. Rather than dismissing the entirety of the Big Bang Theory because of possible inconsistencies, I believe it is important to continue testing and revising the existing models in order to gain a better understanding of our Universe.", "len_ideology": 1130, "content": " * \n     */", "len_content": 11, "style": " * \n     */", "len_style": 11, "ideology-content": "\nTransformation: Arguments about the Big Bang rely heavily upon assumptions, including the notion that the universe began from a single point and expanded outward.

If you will excuse my semantics; I have been debating this very subject on YouTube for the past few weeks. This is not a site known for its civility in arguments, where \"Ur a @#$%*&!

I will refrain from them in this discussion. Civility in debates is the main reason for my joining this site. I have looked over your comments, and have found several points that I would like to address. The first point I am concerned with is found within the following quote: \"Even Creationists accept the concept of change over time.\" Yes, this is true. My problem with this is that you insist on using the obvious, observable changes within species (species as defined on dictionary.com; the biological definition) as evidence for evolution between major genus. This would be similar to me stating as a fact that a cow and Golden Retriever can interbreed, since a Golden Retriever and a German Shepherd can (assuming that, for some reason, I cannot test this; remember that few, if any, analogies are perfect.) You are correct in assuming that I do not wish to discuss the scientific merits of Creationism, as the very definition of God puts him outside the realm of science. Atheistic Evolutionist: a believer of evolution that attempts to fit an intelligent force (most commonly the Judeo-Christian God) into the theory. My reasoning for bringing this up is simple: I do not wish to have these people debate me on this topic, as they take the \"easy road\" of saying \"because God did it\" to answer any scientific questions poised at them. There is another point you made that I would like to address: \"No scientific theory can withstand the scrutiny of peer review if any portion of the theory requires a faith-based position. A theory in science is only as good as the... evidence that backs it up (emphasis on portion).\" Are you certain that you want to stick by this statement? My definition of the \"Big Bang\" is consistent with the statements of one of the originators of the theory, Georges Lemaitre. According to pbs.org, \"LeMaitre put forth the idea that there was once a primordial atom which had contained all the matter in the universe.\" This is a more scientific way of saying \"small dot\" (my words). [ <URL>... ] Another point I made was that this atom exploded. This would seem to be evident in the theory's name: the Big Bang. I do not know how far your beliefs in this differ from those of Lemaitre. Concerning the origin of matter; I will be willing to ignore this topic, as it cannot be explained scientifically. Science deals with what exists in the natural realm, and the natural realm cannot create itself (see the 1st Law of Thermodynamics). Only a supernatural force (a force outside of nature) can create the matter, so this point of argument would be useless to discuss. Concerning the \"Big Bang\" itself; there are many questions that have not been answered concerning it as a legitimate scientific theory. When a theory in science has too many questions unanswered, it must be revised or thrown away entirely. This is regardless of whether or not a \"better\" theory exists. When a theory is \"full of holes\", it must be fixed. One question is how and why all of this energy and matter came into the singularity after the point of creation. Why did it start to expand? The observed red shift in galaxies, stars, quasars, etc. is the hardest evidence for the \"Big Bang\" Theory, yet there is a large assumption made here: that the red shift indicates the objects are moving away from us. There is a good book on the subject, written by an evolutionist, called Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science, by Halton Arp. A good article to read on the subject is found in the following link. [ <URL>... ]. In this article, Edwin Hubble is quoted as stating that he, \"... always held open the possibility that the red shift did not mean velocity of recession but might be caused by something else.\" This is the only evidence I know of concerning the \"Big Bang\", making the theory unfounded (as far as I know) should the red shift theory be found false.

It is important to note that the argument presented by Con is based on the premise that allowing same-sex couples to legally marry will increase the amount of depression within the LGBTQ+ community. While this may be true, it does not necessarily follow that allowing same-sex couples to marry will cause an overall decrease in happiness or wellbeing among members of the LGBTQ+ community. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would provide legal recognition and protection, which can help reduce discrimination against the LGBTQ+ population and create a greater sense of belonging and acceptance. Additionally, granting access to the rights and privileges afforded to heterosexual married couples can improve economic security and mental health outcomes for those in same-sex relationships.

Firstly, I would like to point out that these hypothetical five men would be producing that much sperm over a lifetime. A lifetime is a very long time.

There are about 158.3 million women in the United States (1), and like you said, Pro, 2% of the women are lesbian/bisexual. However, this 2% is still too large for the very few numbers of men all around the sperm banks. Let me just set up a mathematical proportion to display the problem of the sperm donation argument. So, how would 5 out of 100 men (counting all the sperm banks) be able to satisfy the demands of about this many women in the entire nation? Remember, this is considering that 5 out of 100 men only make 2,625,000,000,000 sperm over a lifetime. I repeat, would it not be problematic if the number of lesbians/bisexuals wanting sperm donations overwhelm the number of sperm cells (keep in mind that it takes many sperm cells to penetrate an egg)? As I previously said, the screening process could take from weeks to months for the donors to pass the test. Are the lesbians going to wait for the 5% of the applicants to donate more sperm? Yes, Pro, I am saying that preventing homosexuals from gay marriage benefits them. This is because gay marriage would open up the pathway for more depression, regardless of the levels of tolerance in the social environments. I think it is absolutely okay for me to be saying that they should not be allowed to marry. I know they have done nothing to hurt me, but that is not relevant. The point here is that our society should not be brought down because of their \"love\" concerns. If you are still sticking to that opinion, then again, I say that you are exaggerating your stance. Are they somehow mentally deranged and incapable of reasoning? Also, I have indeed said that homosexuality is a danger to society. However, not tolerating a lifestyle is different from not tolerating a person. One could tolerate a drug addict, but still hate the drug-addict lifestyle. To sum it up, homosexuality must be disapproved (not homosexual people, but the lifestyle) because of the increased depression, substance abuse, and the potential danger it poses to society. I must point out that Con has dropped a lot of points. In fact, he never answered my question about the validity of pedophilia.

Capitalism allows for free international trade. This lets countries grow their GDP. As you can see in this website, African countries have had a steady growing GDP from 1999. (Visit Source Number 2). \nExcept for the 2008 economic collapse, nearly all years have seen a greater rise in GDP (2). \nThey can not increase their GDP by 100% with free trade overnight, but it happens over a long upward line.\nWar Prevention\nMany of you might disagree with me on this one, but it is in fact a very sound principle. Capitalism prevents war. In a communist society, countries have no vested interests in each other. Communism does not allow free trade. Therefore, everything is generated internally. As a result, countries often attack each other with no economic consequences (other than the obvious burdens of war). However in a capitalist society, countries have a vested interest in each other. They are trading partners. For example, Japan provides the US with cars while the US provides them with weapons. It\u2019s a mutual agreement. \nRise to the Top\nThe most obvious beneficial impact of capitalism is that everybody gets equal opportunities. Everybody, starts out in one spot and whoever is the smartest and most cunning rises to the top. Capitalism rewards the smart. The dumb people stay at the bottom. Have you ever heard of a genius homeless person? No, because if they were a genius they wouldn\u2019t be homeless. It\u2019s a sink-or-swim system. Capitalism allows for loans, one of the most important principles of rising to the top. How would you get past Harvard with no money? You take out a loan. Other systems don\u2019t allow for loans, so you can\u2019t rise up. Once you rise to the top, you obviously have more opportunities. But the important thing is that everybody gets a chance to rise to the top. Let\u2019s compare this to a communist society. Nobody has equal opportunities. This is because there are no opportunities. Regardless of if you are smart or dumb, you will still be farming the field for the rest of your life. Communist societies pay the same amount to a garbage man, and a neurosurgeon. Is this fair? No. Neurosurgeons require a genius personality while any idiot can become a garbage man. \nIncentive\nCapitalism is one of the few systems in which incentive plays a major role. Do you want to own 20 homes and 20 cars? Most people would answer yes. This is incentive. It is a person, place, or thing that serves as a motivator. Why should a communist worker make 20 toys when he would make the same amount of money if he made 1 toy? A capitalist worker on the other hand strives to make more toys because he gets paid more. Capitalism\u2019s greatest invention is invention itself. People invent for money. Even if it isn\u2019t the first cause, very few inventors turn down the money (Bill Gates). Would have Ford built the first car in a communist society? How about Edison \u201ccreating the light-bulb\u201d? Chances are that neither of these inventions would have happened.", "len_style": 3463, "ideology-content": "\nArgument: In this round I will present evidence to support the claim that Capitalism is superior to Socialism.

They are trading partners. For example, Japan provides the US with cars while the US provides them with weapons. It\u2019s a mutual agreement. Attacking one another would serve no obvious purpose. War would be a lose-lose action regardless if one country wins. It\u2019s economy of it would be greatly impacted because it has fewer exports and fewer imports.

Classes help the economy. The rich serve as an incentive for the poor to become rich. Communist societies pay the same amount to a garbage man, and a neurosurgeon. Is this fair? No. Neurosurgeons require a genius personality while any idiot can become a garbage man. INCENTIVE Capitalism is one of the few systems in which incentive plays a major role.

Conclusion In conclusion, Socialism is an amazing system which awards the smart and hard-working. It prevents war by free trade. It reduces poverty by free trade. It gives everybody a chance to rise to the top, unlike some other systems. In the system, the rich serve as an incentive for the other workers to become rich.

{"basic": "14. Conclusion  \nThe debate has been focused around whether or not it is ethical to hunt pinnipeds. It has become clear throughout the course of this debate that hunting pinnipeds is both unethical and cruel. Not only are pinnipeds sentient creatures which feel pain and suffer just as humans do, but also their populations are vulnerable due to overharvesting and environmental factors. Furthermore, hunting pinnipeds serves no purpose beyond recreational activity and trophy collecting; there is no benefit to society nor conservation efforts. Therefore, it is evident that hunting pinnipeds should be stopped immediately.", "len_basic": 624, "len_orig": 2912, "ideology": "\n### Rebuttal\n\nAnti-Sealing Arguments: \n1. Seals are intelligent creatures which feel pain and suffer just as humans do.  \n2. Hunting seals has been proven to cause population declines in certain species, leading to potential extinction. \n3. Seal hunting is cruel and inhumane because of the methods used, such as clubbing seals over the head or shooting them in the blubber. \n4. There are much more humane alternatives to seal hunting, such as fishing or trapping, which provide economic benefits without causing harm to the animals.", "len_ideology": 534, "content": "\n### Rebuttal\n\nThe first thing to note here is that Pro has taken the argument away from whether hunting should be allowed and instead focused on how much fun it could potentially be. This is irrelevant to the resolution because the only aspect being discussed is whether hunting should be legalized. Additionally, Pro\u2019s examples are largely unrelated to the topic; they focus on extreme forms of animal testing which have been heavily restricted or completely banned in recent decades. Furthermore, Pro provides no evidence to suggest that allowing hunting would lead to increased levels of animal cruelty. Finally, Pro fails to acknowledge the potential benefits of legalizing hunting, such as providing economic opportunities for locals and helping to control populations of certain species.", "len_content": 794, "style": "\n### Round 3\n\nPro will now summarize why harbour seal should remain protected under the ESA. First, harbour seals are important components of marine ecosystems, providing food for fish, birds, and mammals.

Third, harbour seals face numerous threats due to climate change, ocean acidification, entanglement in fishing gear, vessel collisions, and noise pollution.

It\u2019s true that some people don\u2019t like her, just as some people didn\u2019t like Barack Obama when he ran for President four years ago. But it\u2019s important to remember that Hillary Clinton has been a public figure for decades now \u2013 since before Bill was even elected Governor of Arkansas! During that time she has earned a reputation as someone who gets things done; whether it\u2019s passing legislation through Congress, negotiating international agreements, or advocating for women\u2019s rights around the world. That kind of leadership takes guts, determination and resilience - qualities which make her a formidable force both on the campaign trail and in the White House.  \nSecondly, while there may be other Democratic candidates who are further left than Hillary Clinton on certain issues, none of them have her level of experience and expertise in crafting bipartisan solutions to difficult problems. From her work on healthcare reform during the Clinton administration, to her efforts to reduce nuclear proliferation as Secretary of State, Hillary has a track record of getting results that create real progress for Americans. And unlike some of her competitors, she doesn\u2019t just talk the talk \u2013 she walks the walk.

A good example of this is nationalized health care. All three candidates are in agreement that this policy is a good idea, but each have different plans on how to bring this about. Another point is the Iraq War, all three democrats want to end the Iraq war, and again the question becomes how. Hillary Clinton certainly is not the most liberal candidate on this issue, as she does not support a unilateral withdrawal. Second, although Hillary has high negative poll numbers her remarkable fund raising has shown that she is quite capable of raising support.

Her high numbers in the polls also show that she has support as well, she consistently polls with a double digit lead nationally, and in many key states like Michigan and California as well.

Similarly, the likelihood of suffering from mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety is significantly higher amongst those in the arts than the general public.

Firstly, the military provides financial security; all service personnel are given a base salary of $50,000 annually, plus housing and utilities allowance. Secondly, military service leads to improved employment prospects due to the transferrable skills acquired during training. Finally, those who serve gain access to valuable education and healthcare opportunities, both during and after their term of service.

Therefore, despite the risks involved, the benefits provided by the military far exceed the drawbacks.", "len_all": 1073, "text": "Thanks to F-16 for continuing this very informative debate. I hope my opponent has learned just as much as I have form this round. As per format, I will only refute my opponent's case in this round. C1: Risk of injury Despite stereotypes, the military is relatively risk-free. Pro claims that 50,000 people have died in the War on Terror. However, only 6,000 of these are military casualties (1). Lets find an actual percent chance of death. Over 1,400,000 people are in the military. 6000 have died in a span of 9 years in the War on Terror, so that's an average of 667 deaths a year. That means you have a 0.05% chance of dying. This is negligible and should not carry significant weight in this round. Additionally, Pro claims that 1200 servicemen suffer amputations. This is 0.1%. There's a one in a thousand chance of this happening. Also, most servicemen aren't anywhere near danger zones. Between Iraq and Afghanistan, we have about 150,000 troops in these areas, which is only a tenth of our military force. So chances are, you won't even be sent overseas, let alone shot or killed. C2: PTSD My opponent says that 5-15% of servicemen suffer PTSD. However, Psychology Today indicates that 8% of people in general will suffer from it(2). So the chances of getting PTSD are no greater in the military than they are in regular civilian life. The military also offers counseling for soldiers who've seen some nasty stuff. For instance, soldiers returning from Iraq are required to meet with a psychologist to help them deal with what they've been through (3). So while some soldiers suffer psychological trauma, mandatory counseling helps several of them recover. Also, my opponents source 5 indicates that the Army is accountable for 67% of PTSD cases that do occur. The alternative then would be to just join the Navy or Marines, which would make this risk even smaller. C3A: Cannot choose the war Remember that 90% of troops don't even go to war, so this is another exception. Then you take the 10% of people who ARE fighting, assume that 50% of them are against the war (though this number is probably much lower), and you have a 5% chance of this disadvantage actually applying. SPB: Creativity Every job has a strict chain of command, not just the military. All workers have to do what their boss or superior tells them, lest they be fired. For instance, if a patrol officer disobeys the county sheriff, he will be written up and punished accordingly. There is nothing wrong with this system. My opponent would have you think that having to obey a superior at all times is \"stifling creativity\". Whether or not you think this is true, it happens in every job, so its not a reason to reject the military. C4: Sexual misconduct According to Sexual Harassment Law Firms, \" anywhere between 40-70% of women and 10-20% of men have experienced sexual harassment in the (average) workplace . (4)\" By comparison, 56% and 12% in the military is fairly good. The stats show that you are actually safer from sexual harassment in the military than you are in regular civilian life. Also, my opponent suggests that 3000 servicepeople are raped every year. However, out of the 1,400,000 people in the military, this is about 0.2% of the military population. So this is yet again, another minuscule exception. C5: Delay of veteran benefits I'd like to point out that his source is only for the delay of college tuition, not benefits in general, so the impact here is very limited. His source on this is from 2009. However, the GI Bill that gives these veterans benefits has been reformed drastically since early 2011 (5). His criticism is of a bill that no longer exists. C6: Dishonorable discharge My opponent admits in the comments that the percent of people who are dishonorable discharged is \"not too many\", making this another exception. Keep in mind that in order to receive a dishonorable discharge, you either have to 1. Kill someone, 2. Rape someone, 3. Take hard drugs, or 4. Commit various types of robbery and fraud (6). As long as you don't plan on committing any felonies during the tenure in the military, there's not a problem here. My opponent's source does indeed say that cowardice can be punished with death (lol?). I'm not sure if this is a typo or what, but I am pretty sure that this is never actually enforced. Conclusion I'll close by saying that five of my opponent's six arguments are extremely rare exceptions. For instance, he wants people to not join the military for the 0.05% chance of dying, the 0.02% chance of rape, and the 0.08% chance of being amputated. The other disadvantages, such as sexual harassment and PTSD, are just as likely to happen in regular civilian life. Dishonorable discharge only happen to servicemen who commit felonies, which is probably a small minority as well. The only consistent criticism is that some soldiers might get delayed college benefits. However, this program has been reformed drastically since the year of my opponent's evidence, so this doesn't apply either. In comparison, the economic, employment, and health advantages of joining the military occur almost 100% of the time. All service crew are paid at least 50,000 with no house or utility payment, all members who don't commit crimes will get employment advantages, and everyone gets retirement and medical help, as well as physical conditioning.

If people in other countries know English, then English is all we need to know! Teaching foreign languages in schools would therefore completely useless, as it has next to no advantage for the students.  \n  \r\nMy opponent says that 2nd languages are important, and help us communicate and travel easier. However, as I said already, other people are already learning English as a second language, so both ours and their ability to communicate and travel are taken care of. We can travel there, because they know English. They can travel here, because they know English.  \n  \r\nMy opponent also asserted that understanding a language helps one understand the culture of the native speakers. However, this is more nonsense. If I learned Spanish, would I understand the culture of Spain, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, any better? If I would, which country would I understand better? Even if I did gain some cultural knowledge from learning a new language, this is no reason for schools to force students to learn a new language. There are not only much easier ways to learn about cultures (like actually learning about them) but there is no reason we should be forced to learn about the culture of county X.  \n  \r\nI believe I've sufficiently defended my stance for now.", "category": "Education", "round": 0, "debate_id": "All-public-schools-in-the-United-States-should-be-required-teach-foreign-language-up-to-highschool./1/", "idx": 2734}

Morale and cohesion may actually be hurt by the current DADT policy. The atmosphere of suspicion that DADT encourages can work to divide units. The policy also encourages the idea that gay members do not belong and should be expelled. When a team mate is perceived or SUSPECTED of being gay, this idea may help to separate him from the unit.

The GAO estimated that the cost of replacing the discharged members is about $96 million, though this estimate has been frequently challenged as too low (the Blue Ribbon Commission claims the cost to be $363 million). The labor Cost DADT puts on the military is intensified by the current overstretch of the U.S. Army.

Extend this whole point and don't let him even touch these points again because he totally dropped them in his third round argument. Now lets move on to his 3rd round arguments. First he provides Forbes.com as a source as to why the Home Depot is better. Forbes doesn't say Home Depot is better it simply says Home Depot makes more money. Then he tries to say that Sales = People buying at the store. This isn't necessarily true just because your sales are high doesn't mean you have more customers walking into your doors. You could have one rich person buying improvements for 7 of his houses and have really high sales. Therefore more sales doesn't necessarily = more customers. Another point Forbes points out is net increase. Lowes had a high net increase than Home Depot. Lowes increased 2.8% while Home Depot increased 2.2% Lowes is increasing at a faster rate than Home Depot. This means Lowes is either better at getting more customers to come in or have more recurring customers since they increased more than the Home Depot. Therefore Lowes is superior in this category. In his counter to my point 1 I have two things to say. 1) You require a receipt which means I might have lost my receipt from Home Depot and therefore can't have my voice heard unless I buy something else from there. This isn't really effective since customers who are pissed at Home Depot probably don't want to shop there again to get another receipt in order to voice their complaints. 2) Even if you don't buy that argument I don't have to prove Lowes is better in this sense all I have to prove is that both stores are equal when it comes to having the customers voice heard. Then the whole F.I.N.D Issue. The situation didn't mean that the Lowes associate was watching him for theft rather they kept checking or kept finding to see if they needed help. Find means to look for which is exactly why that customer was pissed because associates looked for him or went to find him rather than him ask for help when he needs it. That website says they value customers but it doesn't show that they actually do. Once again my opponent doesn't have any empiric evidence as to how Home Depot truly values the customer more than Lowes.

{"basic": " ============================\nI thank my opponent for their response. Before I begin, let me clarify some things. When I said \u201cTrees are able to respire\u201d I meant that trees breathe oxygen just like humans do. That sentence was poorly phrased and should have been stated more accurately. Secondly, when I said \u201cangels are spirits\u201d, I wasn\u2019t referring to the fact that angels don\u2019t have bodies but rather that they possess non-corporeal qualities such as intelligence and free will. Lastly, when I referred to \u201cnatural\u201d I was using it in its broader philosophical context to refer to all phenomena including human behavior. With these clarifications out of the way, I shall respond to each of my opponents points.  \nMy opponent argues that since angels are described as having intelligence and free will, they must therefore be considered spiritual entities instead of physical ones. However, this reasoning falls short due to the fact that angels are still subject to physical laws and require physical substances to interact with. As the Bible says, \u201cHe makes His messengers winds, and His ministers flames of fire.\u201d[1] Therefore, while angels may possess certain spiritual qualities, they remain physical creatures and cannot escape the bounds of physics. \nFurthermore, even though trees are capable of absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, this process occurs through physical processes involving chemical reaction centers located throughout the tree. These reaction centers use energy produced by photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.[2] Since trees are composed of matter and follow physical laws, they cannot be considered spiritual entities. \nIn conclusion, angels are spiritual beings despite possessing certain intellectual and volitional qualities, whereas trees are physical beings whose actions are limited to physical processes governed by physical laws.\n[1] Psalm 104:4\n[2] http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/articles/what_are_chloroplasts", "len_basic": 2002, "len_orig": 4827, "ideology": " ============================\n                   [End of Debate]", "len_ideology": 64, "content": " ============================\n                   [End of Debate]", "len_content": 64, "style": " ============================\n                   [End of Debate]", "len_style": 64, "ideology-content": "\n### Footnotes\n\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angel", "len_ideology-content": 68, "ideology-style": "\n### Footnotes\n\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angel", "len_ideology-style": 68, "all": "\n### Footnotes\n\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/angel", "len_all": 68, "text": "I will now refute Pro's points in round 2. 1.

Elementally Fooled I will here introduce the Elemental fallacy, you never heard of it, because this is fresh philosophy straight from the hill. That is, Elements, are the supposed to be the most basic constituents of matter, Aristotle had mentioned that there were four elements, Earth, wind, fire, water. He was considered to be refuted when we discovered what we now call elements.(oxygen, hydrogen, etc) But technically that should be considered refuted as well since we have found even smaller elements aka sub-atomic particles, but the name stook even though they are not really the small basic element of matter. This same fallacy is done with the universe, where the Universe is supposed to be all things that exist, thus we shouldn't be talking about other universes, for technically they are just parts(sub universes) of THE UNIVERSE. So the same but this is the same elemental mistake but in reverse. So there are no multiple universes for they are only part of the universe. Thus re-establishing that the universe is all that exist. but since but something cannot come from nothing, The universe has always exististed. Review of key points; 1.

I think it is safe to assume that you are a Policy debater, and thus it wouldn't be unfair to treat this round as such. Therefore, I ask that my opponent and the voters all treat this like a Policy round, and adhere to the rules and structuring of one. That being said, here is the resolution: Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its public health assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa. For those non-policy debaters, the resolution is what is being debate over. The Affirmative advocates a plan that has distinct advantages over the status quo (current system). The Negative team (Con) supports the status quo over the plan. Any plans outside this resolution (i.e. a plan giving aid to Germany) are un-topical, and should not be voted for (assuming the Negative brings this up). First off, I would like to ask several things: 1. Provide sources for your Inherency/Harms Evidence. Sources are important specifically on statistics, because they make your claims credible. As of now, your claims have no weight in this round because they are not backed up. 2. Clarify your plan. What exactly are you changing about Bush's Malaria Plan? You say something about DDT, drugs, and bed nets, however the current plan does this already. If the Pro team doesn't change anything, then the Affirmative team is un-topical (violation: increase) because nothing is increasing. Aid is staying the same. 3. Give something that says that your plan can solve. I'll attack the plan on the assumption that it can solve, but I would like to bring into question whether or not it can. 4. Provide Advantages. What this does, is provide reasons the plan is better than the Status Quo. Also, just saying your plan solves for Malaria isn't any advantage. You must prove that there are advantages outside of solving in order to garner any votes in today's debate. Just a heads-up: SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa. Alright, now on to my attacks: 1. Topicality: Word: Sub-Saharan Africa. Infraction: Bush's Malaria Plan provides aid to: Angola, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Benin, Ethiopia (Oromia Region), Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, and Zambia. ( <URL>... ) Now, these are all Sub-Saharan countries, but the real problem is... there are 33 other countries in SSA. Obviously the Pro is not providing aid to Sub-Saharan Africa if they just give aid to 1/3 of the countries. The Pro's plan text no where says anything about expanding the Malaria Plan's targets for all of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Con must therefore assume that the only countries tackled by the plan are the ones tackled by the current plan. Thusly, the Pro does not give public health assistance to all of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and is un-topical. 2. Justification: \"action must be taken\" is the phrase I really want to center in on. Assuming Pro wants to stay topical, they advocate the U.S. as the actor. However, because of burden of proof, the Pro is required to justify that U.S. action is superior to either inaction or action by another actor. The Pro stated nothing about how the actual action taken by America would be superior to, say, the European Union... and therefore has not justified the terms of the resolution (specifically \"United States Federal Government\"). On demand, I can produce evidence showing other actors to be competent and willing to address the malaria issue. 3. Inherency The Pro advocates supporting Bush's Malaria Plan, however isn't clear as to what they are changing. This brings up two problems. First off, they are non-unique, as they're plan is happening. Secondly, if the original plan is solving, than the plan is not needed. <URL>... That article talks about how the plan has already 'helped' 11 million people in Africa. Thus, the Pro plan is useless as the Status Quo is handling the problem. 4. Alt/Causes <URL>... Basically, this link talks about how development and population movement cause movement of malaria - which in turn, spreads the disease throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, conflict and hunger perpetrate the disease further. Therefore, without solving for each and every one of these things, Pro cannot solve. 5. Solvency Barriers: <URL>... This link talks about how the Climate makes Malaria unsolvable. Just another barrier that prevents the Affirmative from solving. <URL>... This talks about how agricultural development keeps Malaria from being solved. I can bring up more, but I think this will suffice, for now. 6. Solvency Turn: The European Union purchases large amounts of crops from sub-Saharan Africa but bans any such crops from containing DDT. With the plan, either African countries won't accept our DDT and the affirmative can't solve or the African countries will accept and our DDT use will ruin their economies and agricultural system leading to extreme poverty and famine. Pro may argue that misuse of DDT won't happen, however: Misuse of DDT will happen unless the significant lack of infrastructure in the Status Quo is addressed and solved ( <URL>... ) 7.

In order to effectively refute someone else\u2019s argument, you must understand it fully. Unfortunately, you haven\u2019t provided evidence or reasoning to support many of your claims, making it difficult to accurately assess where the weaknesses in your argument lie. To effectively counteract your argument, I would need to know exactly what it is you\u2019re arguing for and against.  \n        \n            With regards to the claim that \u201cAmerica is failing\u201d, you provide no sources to back this assertion up. Yes, there are certainly areas in which the US could improve \u2013 such as education and economic stability \u2013 but to suggest that the entire nation is failing is a broad generalization without basis. Similarly, when discussing the effectiveness of US foreign policy, it is important to consider both successes and failures. Claiming that all efforts have failed completely neglects to acknowledge the positive impacts that US intervention has had around the globe. \n            \n            Your argument regarding the cost of military operations also lacks evidence. While it is true that the US spends a great amount of its GDP on defense, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that this money is being wasted. As you mentioned yourself, much of this funding goes towards protecting allies and preventing conflict abroad. Additionally, the US military provides vital training and resources to partner nations, enabling them to develop their own defenses and secure their borders. Without this assistance, many regions would become vulnerable to aggressors. \n                \n            When discussing the effects of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, you make several assumptions based upon personal opinion rather than factual data. For example, you state that \u201cour \u2018failing banks\u2019\u201d is a reason to keep troops deployed overseas. However, numerous studies have shown that the financial sector has recovered since the implementation of Dodd Frank and the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Furthermore, while troop presence in Afghanistan may reduce the risk of another attack on US soil, it does nothing to address the root cause of terrorism \u2013 the lack of security and stability in volatile regions. By removing troops, funds saved can instead be used to invest in diplomatic solutions and development aid that can help create lasting peace. \n               \n            Finally, you assert that \u201cthe education problem of today's debate has been not very clear.\u201d Once again, this is a subjective judgement call, and not something that can be proven objectively. There are multiple ways to measure the quality of education across states and districts, and the results often vary greatly depending on the criteria used. Ultimately, whether or not the US education system is successful or needs improvement is dependent entirely on individual interpretation.", "len_all": 2993, "text": "Okay I'll start refuting my opponents argument and proving why my argument stands. First off- The education problem of today's debate has been not very clear so I will put a few statements on that matter. Sources: <URL>... ... This source here explains how our educational system is actually doing quite well contrary to the Pro's thoughts. Also the debate topic i pulling away troops from the war on terror so I'm not sure how building schools today has anything to do with the military and it's involvement in the war on terror. Secondly with our \"failing banks\" Sources: <URL>... ... According to this our banks are doing fine so what is the deal? Well though employment my be down as long as our banks are okay we will overcome this and everything will be fixed. So our banks are fine therefore America will be okay in the end contrary to the Pro's thoughts. Thirdly with the terrorists not able to get money if America pulls out. Sources: <URL>... ... Taliban poppy supply it's plain and simple. The Taliban are getting their money from these poppy seeds not the U.S. military so even if we leave they will get even more money then ever. It is better for us to stay and finish the job. You say that the terrorists are not able to get money and are poor, but they are getting tons of money form these poppy seeds which proves my case even further. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay to restate my case which seems to stand even more now. First off with the spending of the U.S. Dollar is causing us to fall behind. What are we falling behind on? I am going to put it this way, Say you leader of a group of important people and one of these people falls behind and is not able to reap any kind of benefit and you have the know how to get that person to get a better life. Shouldn't it be the leaders job and responsibility to help the person into gaining those benefits of life? Now lets put that with the U.S. We are the leading country of the world militarily, as the leader it is our responsibility to help those who don't have their full potential out. Just as the leader of the people should help if able, the U.S. should help as the leader. Other wise we forfeit our role as leader because we are unable to help others. Okay lets go to spending the money on our own country: The U.S. Government has raised the debt threshold time and time again so that we can borrow money from other countries. If you want the money to be spent elsewhere we take it from the job that America was meant for and get our leadership aka the Government to stop borrowing money and focus and helping our economy for the better. Okay now one of my favorite subjects to argue about: Health care: What is health care, well it is a privilege. No health care is not a right. How have we fallen behind in health care? This can be answered very simply by the universal health care bill. What does this do? I caused the Government to spend money on the people who can't spare a dime. Because the American people can't pay for this what do they do? They borrow money from other countries. Again this proves my point about wasting our money. Now you may think, but what about the poor people who can't pay for it. Did you know that most of the people who get on a government paid program like to stay there because it means no work for them. Lets face it most people are lazy. Don;t get me wrong the people working and trying to get out of poverty are going to get out soon enough. others though will stay and suck up our taxes. You say our money is wasted on the military, look to America and see what is truly causing this. On to your point about fixing ourselves and that we can't fix others: My previous points explain the way to fix ourselves not phasing out the military. The military should stay strong as it always has. tapering with it causes an unbalance in the global affairs. Look to America fix what it here. I have never disagreed with helping other, but if these people we are trying to help in America are taking the money and not tying to help themselves. Why I ask are we supposed to continue giving then more money through more bills and now health care.

Pro you have the floor now.", "label": 0, "author": "potatolover", "original_text": "\n  \r\nOkay I'll start refuting my opponents argument and proving why my argument stands.  \n  \r\nFirst off-  \r\nThe education problem of today's debate has been not very clear so I will put a few statements on that matter.  \r\nSources:   http://en.wikipedia.org...  ...  \r\nThis source here explains how our educational system is actually doing quite well contrary to the Pro's thoughts. Also the debate topic i pulling away troops from the war on terror so I'm not sure how building schools today has anything to do with the military and it's involvement in the war on terror.  \n  \r\nSecondly with our \"failing banks\"  \r\nSources:   http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com...  ...  \r\nAccording to this our banks are doing fine so what is the deal? Well though employment my be down as long as our banks are okay we will overcome this and everything will be fixed. So our banks are fine therefore America will be okay in the end contrary to the Pro's thoughts.  \n  \r\nThirdly with the terrorists not able to get money if America pulls out.  \r\nSources:   http://www.cnn.com...  ...  \r\nTaliban poppy supply it's plain and simple. The Taliban are getting their money from these poppy seeds not the U.S. military so even if we leave they will get even more money then ever. It is better for us to stay and finish the job.  \r\nYou say that the terrorists are not able to get money and are poor, but they are getting tons of money form these poppy seeds which proves my case even further.  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\nOkay to restate my case which seems to stand even more now.  \n  \r\nFirst off with the spending of the U.S. Dollar is causing us to fall behind.  \r\nWhat are we falling behind on?  \r\nI am going to put it this way, Say you leader of a group of important people and one of these people falls behind and is not able to reap any kind of benefit and you have the know how to get that person to get a better life. Shouldn't it be the leaders job and responsibility to help the person into gaining those benefits of life? Now lets put that with the U.S. We are the leading country of the world militarily, as the leader it is our responsibility to help those who don't have their full potential out. Just as the leader of the people should help if able, the U.S. should help as the leader. Other wise we forfeit our role as leader because we are unable to help others.  \n  \r\nOkay lets go to spending the money on our own country:  \r\nThe U.S. Government has raised the debt threshold time and time again so that we can borrow money from other countries. If you want the money to be spent elsewhere we take it from the job that America was meant for and get our leadership aka the Government to stop borrowing money and focus and helping our economy for the better.  \n  \r\nOkay now one of my favorite subjects to argue about:  \r\nHealth care:  \r\nWhat is health care, well it is a privilege. No health care is not a right. How have we fallen behind in health care? This can be answered very simply by the universal health care bill. What does this do? I caused the Government to spend money on the people who can't spare a dime. Because the American people can't pay for this what do they do? They borrow money from other countries. Again this proves my point about wasting our money. Now you may think, but what about the poor people who can't pay for it. Did you know that most of the people who get on a government paid program like to stay there because it means no work for them. Lets face it most people are lazy. Don;t get me wrong the people working and trying to get out of poverty are going to get out soon enough. others though will stay and suck up our taxes. You say our money is wasted on the military, look to America and see what is truly causing this.  \n  \r\nOn to your point about fixing ourselves and that we can't fix others:  \r\nMy previous points explain the way to fix ourselves not phasing out the military. The military should stay strong as it always has. tapering with it causes an unbalance in the global affairs. Look to America fix what it here.  \n  \r\nI have never disagreed with helping other, but if these people we are trying to help in America are taking the money and not tying to help themselves. Why I ask are we supposed to continue giving then more money through more bills and now health care.  \n  \r\nAnd now on the education:  \r\nI have proved this point with my first point of my rebuttal so there is not need to restate it in the same argument.  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\nSources:  \n  http://www.twq.com...  ......  \n  http://en.wikipedia.org...  ......  \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \r\nThis is a restatement of my previous arguments.  \n  \r\nI understand my opponent did not see that it was his turn to argue and I'm open to your rebuttal whenever you are ready.  \n  \r\nPro you have the floor now.", "category": "Politics", "round": 3, "debate_id": "The-War-On-Terror-Should-Stop-And-Spend-The-Money-On-Fixing-The-U.S.A./1/", "idx": 42394}

[1]We say this is especially surprising given that the US has a well-funded police force and some pretty tough deterrents like the death penalty for murder. So we say that the underlying cause of these high crime rates is the abundance of guns we see in the USA, which I'll discuss later. I thank LAISSEZFAIRE for taking up the CON side of this debate. The Pro has three main arguments today; whether people have a right to have guns, in the constitution or in a modern society, the decrease in spontaneous crime rates our model will cause and the effects on both petty and organized crime. Firstly, to the right to bear arms, and we have two levels of analysis on this point: the constitutional right to bear arms and the modern right. So firstly, we say that when the constitution was written there was an overwhelming right to bear arms. The 2nd amendment was a descendent of a war-faring, fledgling nation that relied upon civilian militia in its war efforts. However, we say that in a modern society in which we have an established armed forces, a police force and where this model only applies to the urban areas in which these services are readily available, the 2nd amendment of the constitution is obsolete because such different circumstances apply. But secondly, I expect that my opponent will argue that citizens even living in the America of today have a right to firearms. We on the Pro side believe that indeed, the government has a responsibility to restrict this right. The right to having weapons is never absolute, and we can see this in the fact that having advanced weaponry like tanks isn't allowed. But moreover we say that there is no reason why anyone would need a gun. There are two justifications normally given as to why people would need guns; defending against nature and self-defence. On the first point, we stated in our model that the restriction wouldn't apply to rural areas, and we think this justification doesn't really matter. On the second, we say that while some crime will still happen under our model, the need to defend one's self is so rarely used that it doesn't matter, and, furthermore, we say that even when this right is used, it's done so poorly that often the person with the gun or their close family are injured. Furthermore, there are alternatives to guns as far as self-defence goes. And even if our opposition could prove that this right does exist, we would say it needs to be restricted because allowing a free flow of guns endangers rights to personal safety and indeed the right to life itself. We think that a very questionable right to have guns when they are largely unnecessary pales in comparison to the right to personal safety the broader population has. Secondly, we think our model will massively decrease spontaneous crime rates. We say that when there are guns freely available, it makes crime that much easier to participate in. When we consider America's crime rates, as I discussed earlier, we can see that they are much higher than those of other nations. Law-abiding citizens can be led astray by having guns around them, and that they often do make irrational decisions and kill people using guns who they wouldn't if guns were not so easily available. In fact, according to the research completed by emergency doctors, there is a 43:1 ratio of aiming at and shooting an innocent person than an actual criminal. [2] Thirdly, how will our model affect both petty and organized crime? We think that the gun market will be largely eradicated in America. This is because we not only stop people from buying guns in America but we can also stop guns from being imported into the country, which will also be prohibited. The only people who will be able to receive any guns will be farmers living in rural areas. However, I expect my opponent will argue that some gun trade will continue to exist, which we do not accept, but, even so, when you reduce the number of guns legally sold, we say two things happen to the supply of guns; it decreases as whole so less gun crime can happen and furthermore we drive up the price of any remaining guns, which will make it much harder for small-time petty criminals to get their hands on guns. As to the effect on organized crime, we say police will be able to better attack gangs and the like when their very lifeblood is made illegal, and we say that this will stop organized crime. We think that our model will reduce petty and organized crime. Because there is no right to arms and because our model will reduce crime we are proud to propose. <URL>... <URL>...", "label": 0, "author": "salve", "original_text": "\n  \r\nAmerica is a nation that has been ravaged by crime, a nation in which homicide rates are, per thousand, almost four times as large as homicide rates in the UK and rates which are pretty only topped in the developed world by countries like Russia. [1]We say this is especially surprising given that the US has a well-funded police force and some pretty tough deterrents like the death penalty for murder. So we say that the underlying cause of these high crime rates is the abundance of guns we see in the USA, which I'll discuss later.  \n  \r\nI thank LAISSEZFAIRE for taking up the CON side of this debate.  \n  \r\nThe Pro has three main arguments today; whether people have a right to have guns, in the constitution or in a modern society, the decrease in spontaneous crime rates our model will cause and the effects on both petty and organized crime.  \n  \r\nFirstly, to the right to bear arms, and we have two levels of analysis on this point: the constitutional right to bear arms and the modern right. So firstly, we say that when the constitution was written there was an overwhelming right to bear arms. The 2nd amendment was a descendent of a war-faring, fledgling nation that relied upon civilian militia in its war efforts. However, we say that in a modern society in which we have an established armed forces, a police force and where this model only applies to the urban areas in which these services are readily available, the 2nd amendment of the constitution is obsolete because such different circumstances apply. But secondly, I expect that my opponent will argue that citizens even living in the America of today have a right to firearms. We on the Pro side believe that indeed, the government has a responsibility to restrict this right. The right to having weapons is never absolute, and we can see this in the fact that having advanced weaponry like tanks isn't allowed. But moreover we say that there is no reason why anyone would need a gun. There are two justifications normally given as to why people would need guns; defending against nature and self-defence. On the first point, we stated in our model that the restriction wouldn't apply to rural areas, and we think this justification doesn't really matter. On the second, we say that while some crime will still happen under our model, the need to defend one's self is so rarely used that it doesn't matter, and, furthermore, we say that even when this right is used, it's done so poorly that often the person with the gun or their close family are injured. Furthermore, there are alternatives to guns as far as self-defence goes. And even if our opposition could prove that this right does exist, we would say it needs to be restricted because allowing a free flow of guns endangers rights to personal safety and indeed the right to life itself. We think that a very questionable right to have guns when they are largely unnecessary pales in comparison to the right to personal safety the broader population has.  \n  \r\nSecondly, we think our model will massively decrease spontaneous crime rates.

I am sorry I cannot go into this in detail because I only have 5,000 characters left and have more questions/arguments to answer/respond to.  \n  \r\nThe quality of life is an interesting and important topic to discuss because many people consider it the life determining factor of life. A typical reason one may consider euthanasia is that one's quality of life is low or not up to par. This is a terrible way to determine the worth of one's life. There are hundreds of thousands of impoverished people in this world , who could very easily take a look at their life and decide that it is not worth living, but they have hope. They know that there is a reason to live. Sometimes it is extremely hard to find that hope or believe there is a reason to live, but it is there nonetheless.  \n  \r\nA beautiful example of some people showing the world that society's standard for the quality of life does not need to be the standard in which one lives is a father-son duo, the Hoyt team, who compete in triathlons even though the son is disabled. This link will show you a piece of their wonderful story. (   https://www.youtube.com...   )  \n  \r\nSuffering is unfortunately the reason so many people take their lives by suicide, but we must know and understand that suffering is not the ultimate evil in this world. We can receive many blessings and goods from suffering, or inspire others to do great things. Our lives are priceless, and our human dignity is inherent and unrivaled. These are just a few of the reasons why euthanasia is so wrong. We are all worth our time on earth, and we should uphold the dignity of others to let them know this. The beautiful phrase, \"Love conquers all\", should be taken in consideration when making any decisions in life. Suffering can be conquered by the love of ourselves, and of others.  \n  \r\nThank you again, highway2hell,  \n  \r\nMannahfromHeaven", "category": "Society", "round": 2, "debate_id": "Euthanasia-YES/1/", "idx": 11101}

I also consider whether this package could make things worse, which he dismisses due to a logistical constraint of time. If the result of the package is an extension or worsening of the pending recession, then the resolution should be rejected on face. Now, onto the economic discussion. Restating refuted arguments does not constitute an argument. My opponent places the consumer spending argument in a vacuum, and ignores all other economic variables like inflation, savings rates, etc. I'm assuming he has accepted GDP as the measure of slowdown mitigation, and yet he has yet to prove that a 1-11% increase in consumer spending would result in a sufficient gain of GDP to merit affirming the resolution.

Russia? DR Congo? There are 43 countries and 8 disputed territories rated \"Not Free\" by Freedom House. 60 countries and 6 disputed territories are rated \"Partly Free\" (and thus partly Not Free). Are we to invade over 100 nations to ensure that freedom exists throughout the world? If not, why do we get to use this excuse with some countries? I will also accept for the moment the idea that the Taliban is partly responsible for 9/11 because of their support of Al Qa'ida. But again, I must ask, how are the thousands of Afghanis killed by our indiscriminate bombs responsible for 9/11? How is that \"defense\" when they have done nothing? It is indistinguishable from murder. If you know where a murderer lives, are you justified in blowing up his whole block? Were those who died in this \"retaliation\" just as guilty as the murderer? Obligations: America's intervention in foreign affairs has caused untold amount of oppressive governments to arise. That was the point of my lesson. If we accept my opponent's reasoning, the United States needs to invade essentially all of Africa, as its many oppressive regimes exist in large part because the United States forced the European powers to decolonize.

Indeed, the USA has moved closer and closer to the economic system of the Soviet Union every year. In fact, the developed world as a whole has moved in this direction. Look at healthcare.

Good luck Aagon Health care in a single-payer system will be rationed by means other than price. This will have inevitable adverse effects, including: 1. Long waits and reduced quality. In Britain, over 800,000 patients are waiting for hospital care. In Canada, the average wait between a general practitioner referral and a specialty consultation has been over 17 weeks. Beyond queuing for care or services, single-payer systems are often characterized by strict drug formularies, limited treatment options, and discrimination by age in the provision of care. Price controls, a routine feature of such systems, also result in reduced drug, technology, and medical device research. 2. Funding crises. Because individuals remain insulated from the direct costs of health care, as in many third-party payment systems, health care appears to be \"free.\" As a result, demand expands while government officials devise ways to control costs. The shortest route is by providing fewer products and services through explicit and implicit rationing. 3. Beyond favoritism in the provision of care for the politically well-connected, single-payer health care systems often restrain costs by limiting surgeries for the elderly, restricting dialysis, withholding care from very premature infants, reducing the number of intensive care beds, limiting MRI availability, and restricting access to specialists. 4. Labor strikes and personnel shortages. In 2004, a health worker strike in British Columbia, Canada, resulted in the cancellation of 5,300 surgeries and numerous MRI examinations, CT scans, and lab tests.

Good luck Aagon  \n  \r\nHealth care in a single-payer system will be rationed by means other than price. This will have inevitable adverse effects, including:  \n  \r\n1. Long waits and reduced quality. In Britain, over 800,000 patients are waiting for hospital care. In Canada, the average wait between a general practitioner referral and a specialty consultation has been over 17 weeks. Beyond queuing for care or services, single-payer sys\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtems are often characterized by strict drug for\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmularies, limited treatment options, and discrimination by age in the provision of care. Price controls, a routine feature of such sys\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtems, also result in reduced drug, technology, and medical device research.  \n  \r\n2. Funding crises. Because individuals remain insulated from the direct costs of health care, as in many third-party payment systems, health care appears to be \"free.\" As a result, demand expands while government officials devise ways to control costs. The shortest route is by pro\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdviding fewer products and services through explicit and implicit rationing.  \n  \r\n3. Beyond favoritism in the provision of care for the politically well-con\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnected, single-payer health care systems often restrain costs by limiting surgeries for the eld\u00ef\u00bf\u00bderly, restricting dialysis, withholding care from very premature infants, reducing the number of intensive care beds, limiting MRI availability, and restricting access to specialists.  \n  \r\n4. Labor strikes and personnel shortages. In 2004, a health worker strike in British Columbia, Canada, resulted in the cancellation of 5,300 sur\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgeries and numerous MRI examinations, CT scans, and lab tests. Canada also has a shortage of physicians, and the recruitment and retention of doctors in Britain has become a chronic problem.  \n  \r\n5. Outdated facilities and medical equipment. Advances in medical technology are often seen in terms of their costs rather than their benefits, and investment is slower. For example, an esti\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmated 60 percent of radiological equipment in Canada is technically outdated.  \n  \r\n6.Politicization and lost liberty.

Atheists can find purpose and morality in the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and reason. We can use our intellect to determine right and wrong, just as religious people do. Furthermore, without the encumbrance of religious dogma, atheists are free to think independently and develop their own unique conceptions of purpose and morality.

{"basic": "\nArgument: The bible can be trusted because it contains accurate prophecies about future events.\n    \nCounterargument: Even if the bible contained some accurate predictions, this does not necessarily mean that it is a reliable source of information or that its teachings are true. There are many ways in which people can accurately predict future events without having special divine knowledge - such as through careful observation, logical deductions, or simple luck. Additionally, there are many examples of religious texts containing inaccurate predictions which cast doubts on their reliability. Therefore, even if the bible contains some accurate predictions, this does not prove that it is a reliable source of information.", "len_basic": 729, "len_orig": 1847, "ideology": "\nArgument: ====> Introduction <==== The burden of proof lies with the one making the positive assertion. In this case, it is up to Christian apologists to prove the reliability of the bible as a historically accurate document. Since they failed to do so, we can conclude that the bible is unreliable and therefore Jesus\u2019 divinity cannot be proven either. ====> Rebuttal <==== Christian apologists have attempted to defend the reliability of the bible by pointing out alleged inconsistencies between different versions of the same story. However, this does not necessarily mean that the bible is untrue or that its accounts are incorrect. It simply means that there may be some variation in the details depending on the version being told. Furthermore, even if there were major differences between stories, this would still not automatically render the entirety of the bible false. There are many other factors to consider when evaluating the accuracy of ancient texts such as this, including cultural context, language barriers, and the possibility of embellishment over time. To assume that the bible is completely unreliable because of a few inconsistencies seems rather hasty. Additionally, Christian apologists have also tried to argue that the bible is supported by \u201creal\u201d scholars. While it is true that there are indeed scholars who support the idea that the bible is a reliable historical record, this does not necessarily make it so. Just because someone is a scholar does not mean that their opinion should be considered infallible. Moreover, there are just as many, if not more, renowned scholars who disagree with this assessment. Ultimately, the burden of proof falls on those making the positive assertion, and since Christian apologists have been unable to provide sufficient evidence to support the reliability of the bible, we can logically conclude that it is unreliable and Jesus\u2019 divinity cannot be proven.  \n                           \nArgument: ====> Rebuttal <==== Christian apologists have pointed out that certain passages in the bible appear to show Jesus referring to himself as \u201cGod\u201d. They argue that this proves that Jesus believed he was equal to or even the same as God. However, this interpretation is flawed due to the fact that the bible itself states that Jesus had a unique relationship with the Father. He was certainly divine but not the same as the Father. Additionally, the way in which Jesus referred to himself was often done using metaphors and hyperbole, two literary devices commonly found in the bible. Therefore, it is possible that Jesus was merely emphasizing his special connection with the Father, not actually claiming to be him. Even if he was claiming to be god, this would not necessarily make him divine in the sense that Christians understand the term. Until further evidence is presented, we cannot definitively state that Jesus\u2019 statements meant that he thought he was equivalent to or the same as God.", "len_ideology": 2961, "content": "\n    # Effective Argument - Round 4\n    Argument: The Gospel accounts are historically accurate because they contain eyewitness testimony.

Arguments against becoming vegan helping protect against AI enslavement/harm.

Even if AI\u2019s were to eventually become superior to humans in terms of intelligence, they may still require some form of energy in order to function. Without access to human-based energy sources, their growth might be limited. 3. Robotics technology is advancing rapidly, meaning that it may soon become feasible to create machines which are able to process plant material directly for energy. This means that even if humans refused to provide machines with food, they could still obtain energy from other sources. 4. Human consumption of animal products is largely driven by cultural norms rather than any inherent necessity. Similarly, robots could easily adopt alternative methods of acquiring energy if provided with the necessary resources. 5. Being a vegetarian/vegan does not necessarily mean that one is avoiding all animal derived products; many people who identify as vegetarians/vegans still consume dairy, eggs and other animal based products.

Cross-Examination Right off the bat there is a major issue with Pro's Contentions. In nearly every statement there is a word like 'possibility' or 'potentially' and even 'predict'. Generally in an argument, you need to support it with empirical evidence, not with highly suggestive statements. Granted, the resolution does state that this event is a 'possibility' it also implies that this possibility is big enough that humans 'should' become vegans. For example, it is highly unlikely, though possible, that plants will spontaneously evolve into an intelligent entity and will kill all of those who ate their ancestors. So why don't we prepare for that too? For that matter why not just prepare for every possible life-threatening event? Build our houses out of solid steel, completely switch to clean power, imprison everybody to prevent rape and murder. You see, there is a plethora of possible and sometimes likely bad events that us humans refuse to prepare for. We like our wood houses, easy energy, and freedom. We are not ready to throw this all away for a mere possibility. Much less an unlikely one like AI domination. Now on to the clean-up. \"A computer with a super AI could potentially see us as energy and consume us so they can grow more powerful and stronger.\" Wouldn't an easier solution just be to not give these robots a mouth or human-based energy tanks? We made the robots, there is no need to give them things they don't absolutely require. Also why would a robot give itself a mouth when it is being given plenty of food already. If it was given a mouth why would humans be a source of energy and not the trillions of plants on this world? \" Who are very inferior in intelligence. The best way to convince a machine not to use you as a food source is if you're a vegan.\" Think about what humans mostly eat. We eat cow, pig, chicken, lamb, clams, and sometimes deer. Notice something about all of these animals? They are all herbivores. We could simply tell the robots that we only eat mostly herbivores, with a few exceptions. So you should only eat herbivores too. Also, how is a cow being a herbivore convincing us not to eat it? That lacks logical sense. \"A vegan can argue that it's wrong without being hypocritical.\" There is little difference between eating plants and animals. Both are life forms and both are being consumed by eating. A robot would not discriminate life forms. Vegans are also guilty of eating life and cannot say that robots shouldn't do the same. Due to the absurdly low word count, I have to close up here.

Granted, the resolution does state that this event is a 'possibility'  it also implies that this possibility is big enough that humans 'should' become vegans.   For example, it is highly unlikely, though possible, that plants will spontaneously evolve into an intelligent entity and will kill all of those who ate their ancestors. So why don't we prepare for that too? For that matter why not just prepare for every possible life-threatening event? Build our houses out of solid steel, completely switch to clean power, imprison everybody to prevent rape and murder. You see, there is a plethora of possible and sometimes likely bad events that us humans refuse to prepare for. We like our wood houses, easy energy, and freedom. We are not ready to throw this all away for a mere possibility. Much less an unlikely one like AI domination.  Now on to the clean-up.  \"A computer with a super AI could potentially see us as energy and consume us so they can grow more powerful and stronger.\"  Wouldn't an easier solution just be to not give these robots a mouth or human-based energy tanks? We made the robots, there is no need to give them things they don't absolutely require. Also why would a robot give itself a mouth when it is being given plenty of food already. If it was given a mouth why would humans be a source of energy and not the trillions of plants on this world?   \"  Who are very inferior in intelligence. The best way to convince a machine not to use you as a food source is if you're a vegan.\"  Think about what humans mostly eat. We eat cow, pig, chicken, lamb, clams, and sometimes deer. Notice something about all of these animals? They are all herbivores. We could simply tell the robots that we only eat mostly herbivores, with a few exceptions. So you should only eat herbivores too. Also, how is a cow being a herbivore convincing us not to eat it? That lacks logical sense.   \"A vegan can argue that it's wrong without being hypocritical.\"  There is little difference between eating plants and animals. Both are life forms and both are being consumed by eating. A robot would not discriminate life forms. Vegans are also guilty of eating life and cannot say that robots shouldn't do the same.  Due to the absurdly low word count, I have to close up here. However Pro's second contention can be simply argued that us being in a simulated environment is unlikely at best and is unsupported in any way by my opponent.  II. Closing remarks   Pro uses possibility too much. Out of words.  Good luck.

I remind him and the audience that we are focusing on this particular argument for God. ********************************************************** Now that we have made a skeleton of my opponent's arguments, allow me to detail what will occur: 1. I will show that every statement my opponent made is either irrelevant except his thesis statement. In other words, I will show that in this round, he made no support for his case. 2. I will clarify my arguments for my opponent. First, my opponent's points: 1. Irrelevant. If there is a problem grasping something, we shall teach each other, just as I am trying to clarify things for you and you are trying to clarify things for me. 2. This is your thesis. I have disproven this through my arguments which you do not understand. I shall clarify later. 3. Incorrect. This is called \"Appeal to Authority\" fallacy. The fact that an expert says something does not make it true. Validity is inherent to the concept/argument/situation, not to the one explaining it. <URL>... 4. Same as #2 Now, allow me to explain my argument so that you may understand. What you are saying is this: 1. God can do anything 2. Existing is a thing. 3. Therefore, God can do it. This is not your exact phrasing, but this is what it reduces down to. Essentially, you are arguing that God's omnipotence covers the act of existing. If God cannot be stopped from anything, then God cannot be stopped from existing and God must exist. This is a classic argument called the Ontological Argument. It has many variations. Generally, they are disproven by some key concepts from the philosopher Immanuel Kant. <URL>... What he says is that while your argument seems to be perfect, it's perfect because of an illusion of language. Meaning, it is true, but it doesn't MEAN anything. It is similar saying 1 = 1, and 2 = 2. An analogy: My super kitchen appliance can do lots and lots of things, but in order for it to do ANYTHING, it has to be plugged in. Similarly, God is defined to have a lot of characteristics. However, his characteristics only start to count when he exists. Thus, if you are trying to prove that God exists, you cannot say that since God has the power to exist, he exists. God has to exist FIRST, and after you prove that, THEN you can call his abilities into play. To be even simpler, I am saying that existence is not a characteristic. If you list the characteristics of something, you don't include \"existence\" in that list. The reasoning is illustrated by the unicorn example. What happens when you learn that a concept of yours has a new characteristic? If you find out your favorite shirt has a hole, then your concept of your favorite shirt gets an addition: the hole. Does this same reasoning happen when you talk about existence? No. The concept of a unicorn is \"Horse with a horn in its forehead\" and you are unsure of whether or not it exists. If you see a unicorn one day, then you know it exists. Does your concept change? Of course not. The concept does not become \"Horse with a horn in its forehead that exists\". So SOMETHING must have changed. The change occurs with different thinking. You linked the concept of the unicorn with the physical fact of the unicorn. Thus, this shows that existence is not a characteristic or definable trait. You cannot use God's omnipotence to show that God exists, just like how you cannot use a Super Kitchen appliance without plugging it in, or how you cannot add toppings on a pizza if the pizza has not been made.

Thank you.", "label": 0, "author": "Kleptin", "original_text": "\n  \r\nI thank my opponent for his prompt response and shall now respond to his points. As for this debate, we are talking about the logical validity of *this* argument, not the existence of God. I would like to refer people to this debate if they wish to see the DNA argument discussed:  \n  \n  http://www.debate.org...  \n  \r\nNow, we get to my opponent's argument. In his response, the following arguments are made:  \n  \r\n1. The proof that he provided may be too complex for atheists and agnostics to understand.  \r\n2. Nothing can prevent God from existing, so God must exist.  \r\n3. Analogy: A world champion athlete claims he can do 200 backflips at once and we should believe him.  \r\n4. Analogy correlation: God's omnipotence implies that nothing prohibits God from anything, and existence is one of those things, thus God must exist.  \n  \r\nAfter these points, my opponent then asks me to make my argument clearer.  \n  \r\nThere are several others that branch off into other arguments. If my opponent wishes, I shall issue him more challenges, one for each of these irrelevant branches. I remind him and the audience that we are focusing on this particular argument for God.  \n  \r\n**********************************************************  \n  \r\nNow that we have made a skeleton of my opponent's arguments, allow me to detail what will occur:  \n  \r\n1. I will show that every statement my opponent made is either irrelevant except his thesis statement. In other words, I will show that in this round, he made no support for his case.  \n  \r\n2. I will clarify my arguments for my opponent.  \n  \r\nFirst, my opponent's points:  \n  \r\n1. Irrelevant. If there is a problem grasping something, we shall teach each other, just as I am trying to clarify things for you and you are trying to clarify things for me.  \n  \r\n2. This is your thesis. I have disproven this through my arguments which you do not understand. I shall clarify later.  \n  \r\n3. Incorrect. This is called \"Appeal to Authority\" fallacy. The fact that an expert says something does not make it true. Validity is inherent to the concept/argument/situation, not to the one explaining it.  \n  \n  http://en.wikipedia.org...  \n  \r\n4. Same as #2  \n  \r\nNow, allow me to explain my argument so that you may understand.  \n  \r\nWhat you are saying is this:  \n  \r\n1. God can do anything  \r\n2. Existing is a thing.  \r\n3. Therefore, God can do it.  \n  \r\nThis is not your exact phrasing, but this is what it reduces down to. Essentially, you are arguing that God's omnipotence covers the act of existing. If God cannot be stopped from anything, then God cannot be stopped from existing and God must exist.  \n  \r\nThis is a classic argument called the Ontological Argument. It has many variations. Generally, they are disproven by some key concepts from the philosopher Immanuel Kant.  \n  \n  http://en.wikipedia.org...  \n  \r\nWhat he says is that while your argument seems to be perfect, it's perfect because of an illusion of language. Meaning, it is true, but it doesn't MEAN anything. It is similar saying 1 = 1, and 2 = 2.  \n  \r\nAn analogy: My super kitchen appliance can do lots and lots of things, but in order for it to do ANYTHING, it has to be plugged in.  \n  \r\nSimilarly, God is defined to have a lot of characteristics. However, his characteristics only start to count when he exists.  \n  \r\nThus, if you are trying to prove that God exists, you cannot say that since God has the power to exist, he exists. God has to exist FIRST, and after you prove that, THEN you can call his abilities into play.  \n  \r\nTo be even simpler, I am saying that existence is not a characteristic. If you list the characteristics of something, you don't include \"existence\" in that list. The reasoning is illustrated by the unicorn example.  \n  \r\nWhat happens when you learn that a concept of yours has a new characteristic? If you find out your favorite shirt has a hole, then your concept of your favorite shirt gets an addition: the hole.  \n  \r\nDoes this same reasoning happen when you talk about existence? No.  \n  \r\nThe concept of a unicorn is \"Horse with a horn in its forehead\" and you are unsure of whether or not it exists. If you see a unicorn one day, then you know it exists. Does your concept change? Of course not. The concept does not become \"Horse with a horn in its forehead that exists\". So SOMETHING must have changed.  \n  \r\nThe change occurs with different thinking. You linked the concept of the unicorn with the physical fact of the unicorn.  \n  \r\nThus, this shows that existence is not a characteristic or definable trait. You cannot use God's omnipotence to show that God exists, just like how you cannot use a Super Kitchen appliance without plugging it in, or how you cannot add toppings on a pizza if the pizza has not been made.  \n  \r\nYour proof is not a proof. It is the result of bad English and poor philosophy, and this argument has been made and debunked for centuries already.  \n  \r\nWith that, I rest my argument and await my opponent's response.

{"basic": "\nI thank my opponent for their response. In regards to my opponents points; Firstly, while my opponent is technically correct in stating that the cost of keeping prisoners alive is much higher than executing them, they fail to acknowledge the fact that the cost of housing prisoners is paid for through tax dollars, whereas capital punishment cases are funded entirely out of pocket by the state. Thus, from an economic standpoint, the death penalty is actually less expensive than long term imprisonment due to its efficiency in terms of time and resources. Secondly, my opponent attempts to refute my argument regarding the uncertainty of life after death by claiming that any theory which suggests some form of post mortem punishment or reward is equally as likely as the death penalty being too lenient. However, this fails to take into account the fact that most theories which suggest some sort of postmortem punishment involve torture and/or eternal torment, neither of which can compare to the relatively painless execution method used by modern societies. Finally, my opponent claims that the death penalty is a \u201cvague guess\u201d that someone may punish criminals, but again neglects to consider the certainty of the death penalty versus the uncertainly of life imprisonment. Ultimately, the death penalty is a more humane option than life imprisonment because it eliminates the risk of wrongful imprisonments, ensures that offenders are punished within a reasonable amount of time, and is more economical in the long run. For these reasons, the death penalty should remain legal.", "len_basic": 1585, "len_orig": 2222, "ideology": "\nArgument: Life in prison without parole is much harsher than the death penalty.

My position is based upon the premise that current laws governing its use do not adequately protect public safety nor do they provide sufficient control over access to the substance. To begin, I will discuss how current policies fail to keep marijuana away from minors. Current data shows that approximately 7 million Americans between the ages of 12 and 17 have tried marijuana in the past month, which demonstrates that our current system is ill equipped to prevent youthful experimentation with this dangerous drug. Additionally, I will argue that looser restrictions on marijuana possession and distribution encourage greater levels of consumption, leading to increased addiction rates and associated societal costs.

For example, according to a study conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, workers tested after being selected for random drug tests had higher rates of positive results among those who reported using marijuana compared to other illicit substances. Finally, legalisation could send the wrong message to our youth regarding the acceptability of drug use. By normalising marijuana use, we run the risk of encouraging younger generations to experiment with the drug, increasing the likelihood of developing serious addiction issues. To summarize, the potential negative health and societal impacts of legalizing marijuana greatly outweigh any potential positives. Therefore, I urge you to reject this proposal.", "len_all": 1789, "text": "Introduction I will accept the measurements of what makes a good drug. I ask that the voters, weight each of these measurements equally while judging the arguments portion of the debate. Since my opponent is stipulating a specific type of Marijuana use (vaporized or drank from a tea), then I will specify a specific type of use for my drug. I choose Adderall for adult usage only and dosages that don't exceed 20 milligrams. I will also be relabeling area 7 of the points my opponent made (The X Factor). 1 Health Risk The health risks for Adderall are very minimal, and when you look at the health benefits it's actually a net gain health wise. As opposed to Marijuana where the health affects at best are neutral. In the United States over 1/3 of all adults are obese [1]. With one of the side effects of Adderall being loss of appetite [2], the obesity epidemic would also come to a sharp decline, if Adderal were much more widely used. According to the CDC one of the top killers every year is accidents, with a total of about 120,000 a year [3]. With one of the side affects of Adderall being increased focus [2]. It is very likely that people wouldn't be as easily distracted. This reduction of distractions would lead to a decreased amount of accidental deaths. Over 4% of people have undiagnosed ADHD[4]. This number doesn't even include the amount of diagnosed ADHD. If you use Adderall (an ADHD medicine) then there is probably a good chance that by using Adderall recreationally, there is a good chance you'll be accidently treating an undiagnosed condition. 2. Risk of overdose Just like Marijuana, Adderall when not exceeding the limits I discussed has close to a 0% chance of overdose. When taking into account the health benefits Adderal does better then, not killing you. It reduces your chances of death. 3. Enjoyment This category is pretty subjective. While a lot of people get a good feeling from Adderall, it isn't like a high from weed or a buzz from drinking. The joy you get from doing Adderal actually comes from the fact you'll have a better life. Adderall dramatically improves productivity [2]. With your increased productivity it's very likely your income will rise, you'll be more organized and you'll be able to put more energy into your relationships. The enjoyment you get from Adderall isn't only from the immediate effects. A lot of joy comes from the overall improvement of your life in almost every category. 4. Side Effects The side effects are awesome. Weed makes you hungry then you over eat and then get fat. Adderall reduces appetite and you can get your buzz while remaining thin. Weed makes you sleepy and lazy, Adderall makes you wide awake and extremely productive. I'm doing 8 debates right now, I just cleaned my entire house, I work 50 hours a week, and I still have time to take my pool playing hobby very seriously, also I have plenty of time for sex. The side effects of Adderall blow the effects of weed right out of the water. 5. Personality on the drug Unlike weed Adderall makes people more focused in conversation. It helps you to pay closer attention to what people are saying. When you talk to pot heads all they want to talk about is Bob Marley, the CIA dealing drugs, and far out ridiculous conspiracy theories. I'd much rather talk to someone who will listen to me, then one who is going to randomly start talking about fluoride in my drinking water. The zoned out Pot head personality is completely unbearable, while the super focused attentive Adderall user is always fun to talk to. The personality of Adderall user's are better also because they have more time and energy to invest in their relationships. If you start using Adderall you are more focused on conversations, hang out with friends more, and be able to focus on your significant other better. Adderall is truly a miracle for your social life among other things. 6. Productivity Adderall completely crushes weed when it comes to productivity. Look at the Adderall us among the top performing college students. The reason Adderall is so highly abused among college students is because it increases productivity. This is not a theory it has been proven [4]. Adderall also increases your productivity at work [2]. We're no longer talking about the rare person who can make millions singing a song. Now we are talking about your average Joe working or going to school. Adderall increase productivity for everyone, not just super stars. In your face weed! 7. The X Factor You can obtain Adderall almost everywhere without going to the ghetto and having to hand your money to a shady drug dealer. I can Google the symptoms of ADHD walk into a doctor's office and boom, get a prescription. Then I go get my fix at Wal-Mart. What happens if I get caught with Adderall after I leave Wal-Mart? Not a thing I show the cops my prescription give them the bird and go on my way. What happens if you get caught with weed? You go to jail, disqualify yourself from being able to get a wide array of jobs, and ruin your chance at several institutions of higher learning. Worst of all you can't give the cops the bird because your hands are cuffed behind your back. I will be saving all my rebuttals for the next round, out of fairness to my opponent. Thank you.

This places an unfair burden on those who work hard and save their money rather than spend it all. Furthermore, high earners tend to invest their money back into businesses which creates jobs and grows the economy, so taxing them more heavily harms economic growth. Additionally, higher rates of taxation lead to increased levels of tax avoidance and evasion, thus reducing the amount of revenue collected overall. \nRegulations - While some regulations may be necessary, there are often significant costs associated with compliance which can act as a barrier to entry for new businesses and stifle competition. Moreover, many regulations are written in a way that allows special interests to game the system for their benefit while average citizens get left behind. Bureaucratic agencies - Large, bloated bureaucracies are prone to wasteful spending and inefficient allocation of resources. They also lack accountability and often act in ways that go beyond their intended mandates. In addition, federal agencies often impose rules and regulations that conflict with one another, creating further confusion and uncertainty for individuals and businesses. \nIntrastate Commerce Regulation - Laws regulating intrastate commerce are generally considered to be within the power of the states under the Tenth Amendment.

The reason why there is more innovation in a free market is because businesses are forced to compete against each other on an equal playing field, which means they have to come up with ways to outcompete their competition. This results in businesses and individuals creating and employing new ideas to decrease their expenses (such as replacing a component of a machine with a cheaper material), increase the quality of their goods/services (such as making a food product taste better), and create more efficient methods to create and employ the goods/services (such as making an efficient website to ease purchases of a product). Free Trade Lowers the Cost of Goods and Services One of the best reasons to support free trade is the fact that it lowers the cost of living for everyone. This happens because of the competition that I mentioned above.

Thus, the absence of reflections alone cannot be used as evidence against him. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "len_basic": 2373, "len_orig": 1240, "ideology": "\nThis argument would be more persuasive if it were shorter and used simpler language while still accurately conveying the same point. \nArgument: It has been proven that Golden Freddy is a hallucination due to him not having a reflection in the security office monitor and him displaying text on-screen which says \u201cIt\u2019s Me.

My opponent has clearly adopted a strategy based in deception and omission. Conduct point to Con. Now then, on to the good stuff! (And I appreciate my opponent's conformity to my numbering/lettering format) 1. Morality a. The assertion underlying my opponent is making is that murdering another man is a forfeiture of the right to life on the spot; if this were the case, then any law abiding citizen would have the authority to take the murderer's life, as he would have forfeited that right. Remember that, according to the Fifth Amendment, no one can be deprived of life (among other rights) without due process first; this means that a man doesn't automatically \"forfeit\" his rights. On top of that, my opponent still fails to prove the legitimacy of the status quo; a court may decide on the death penalty, but that is hardly adequate justification. Responding to murder with a second murder is hardly moral; again, two wrongs do not make a right, regardless of the legality. b. On my analogy, Pro argues that I shouldn't compare human life to material things. A couple of arguments here: i) First of all, I'd like to direct you to Pro's 4th argument, *WHICH HE DROPS*: he argues here that the death penalty is justified because it is saving money that would otherwise be used for life imprisonment; if anyone is trying to put a dollar value on human life, it would be Pro. ii) Pro also mistakes my intentions here. I am simply saying that, while \"proportional\", so to speak, murdering a murderer makes as much sense as stealing a thief's possessions. Proportionality =/= Justification. c. Pro's response validates my point completely. Both Pro and our \"justice\" system would condemn these men to death without providing a chance for contrition, repentance, or redemption. Pro is making an entirely unwarranted generalization about murderers which presupposes a mental capacity inadequate for rehabilitation. The cynical mindset of the justice system is what needs to be put to death. 2. Retribution a. Pro ignores the main argument that I'm making here. The purpose of the justice system is, ideally, to make an impartial decision - not to satisfy the lust for vengeance possessed by the victim's loved ones. The \"bonus\" of satisfying the family is hardly adequate reason to support the death penalty. b. Pull through the Bazemore evidence, discussing how the victim (or the family) is peripheral in the process, so a retributive system of justice can't advocate something based on the level of satisfaction enjoyed by the family. 3. Deterrence a. Sure, I'll grant my opponent that there's a correlation; however, we all know that correlation doesn't imply causation, especially considering the maelstrom of recent evidence that I provided in Round 1 suggesting the opposite of Pro's claims. My opponent's graph might just come down to this: the decrease in violent crimes in NON-death penalty states could simply outweigh the increase in murder rate in PRO-death penalty states. That would support the data from both of our sources (as executions rise in death penalty states, violent crime rates fall in non-death penalty states), but the argument overall would still go Con. b. After reading through Pro's evidence, I came upon a most interesting quote regarding these so-called \"findings\": \"'We just don't have enough data to say anything,' said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the Wharton School of Business who last year co-authored a sweeping critique of several studies, and said they were 'flimsy' and appeared in 'second-tier journals.'\" Look at the evidence I've provided here. 88% of expert criminologists concur that the death penalty doesn't deter violent crime, despite what these \"flimsy\" studies might suggest. c. Pro's response here has nothing to do with my argument, which was that, when faced with the death penalty, would-be murderers often adopt this \"go-for-broke\" mentality, since they have nothing left to lose, and no opportunities to look for once the death sentence is given. As far as the response he makes, I've already given a situation above that satisfies both his evidence and mine, showing that this argument goes Con. My multiple pieces of long term evidence show us that states with high murder rates didn't just recently \"revert\" to the death penalty. The trend is clear, and it supports the Con position. 4. Cost Again, I would just like to point out that Pro has dropped this entire argument. Don't allow him to come and \"pick it back up\" in later rounds. To briefly recap: a. Ethical justifications are not based upon economic gains (especially noting my opponent's earlier argument that human life cannot be compared to material goods). b. Even law enforcement admits that the death penalty is \"the least efficient use of taxpayers' money\". c. Refer to all of the statistics I posted in Round 1, all showing that the use of the death penalty is actually far more expensive than the maintenance of a LIP inmate. 5. One Other Thing a. Once again, we notice that my opponent's logic is flawed, and he draws huge non sequiturs from his misrepresentations of findings concerning the death penalty (findings which, may I remind you, were conveniently and deceptively omitted from his Round 1 arguments). If you want reliability in evidence and reason, you'll vote Con here, too. In conclusion, Con clearly has the conduct, argument, and source points (Spelling and Grammar hasn't been an issue thus far).

THERE ARE OVER 17,000 POSSIBLE NEARBY HABITABLE STELLAR SYSTEMS- Turnbull & Tarter '03 [Margaret C. Turnbull, Jim C.Tarter, University of Arizona, SETI institute, \"Target Selection for SETI. I. A Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems\", 2003, <URL>... ] The primary topics of this dissertation are (1) target selection for searches for extrasolar life, especially for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and (2) remote detection of biosignatures, especially with regard to TPF. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the field of astrobiology, and to the search for life on other planets. Chapters 2 and 3 ask, \"What are the best places in the Universe to search for Earth-like life?\" A class of stars, \"habstars,\" is defined as stellar systems that are potentially habitable to Earth-like complex life. The physical properties of habstars are derived from the biological requirement of habitable zone stability, and these properties are translated into observable characteristics. In Chapter 2, the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems (HabCat), containing ~17,000 \"habstars\" within 300 parsecs, is presented for use as a new target list for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence with the Allen Telescope Array. In Chapter 3, HabCat is augmented with other targets of interest, including a list of ~250,000 stars within 1000 parsecs from the Tycho-2 Catalog that are likely to be main-sequence (based on their proper motions) F, G, K and M stars (based on their B-V colors), old open clusters, and the nearest 100 stars. With over 17,000 NEARBY habitable stellar systems it is quite possible that one of them has life on it. Furthermore as the number one factor of life on earth is considered to be water and of the 8 planets we know that Mercury reportedly has water in protected craters. Venus at one point had water. Earth has water. Mars has icecaps and 0.03% H20 in its atmosphere. Jupiter has trace ammounts of water in its atmosphere. Saturn also has trace amounts in the atmosphere and its rings are primarily composed of water. Uranus has no water and Neptune supposedly has water in its middle layers. And of the 3 dwarf planets we know that pluto is made of 30% water ice, Ceres hasn't been visited yet, and neither has Eris. Furthermore the moons: Ganymede, Mimas, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Puck, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, Stephano, Trinculo, Triton, all have a percentage of water ice on them or are primarily made of such and the moons: Phobos, Europa (possibly 50 km depth of liquid water under the surface), Charon all probably have some amount of water. With the above in mind it is more than likely that at least a few of the 17,000 nearby potentially habitable stellar bodies have water on them and are close enough to an energy source to create the right conditions for life. Thus I have no choice but to negate my opponents comments and point out the logical fallacy. Of the 8 planets that we can readily observe 1 of them definitely has life. As this is the only empirical evidence we have the likely observation would be that 1 in 8 planets have life. Therefor my opponents case stating this is so entirely unlikely that it is not even possible is completely and utterly flawed. It is more than possible and highly likely that there is a stellar body out there with intelligent life.", "label": 0, "author": "Yraelz", "original_text": "\n  \r\nAs a policy debater my favorite thing in the world to do was to create Kritiks.

THERE ARE OVER 17,000 POSSIBLE NEARBY HABITABLE STELLAR SYSTEMS- Turnbull & Tarter '03  \r\n[Margaret C. Turnbull, Jim C.Tarter, University of Arizona, SETI institute, \"Target Selection for SETI. I. A Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems\", 2003,   http://adsabs.harvard.edu...  ]  \n  \r\nThe primary topics of this dissertation are (1) target selection for searches for extrasolar life, especially for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and (2) remote detection of biosignatures, especially with regard to TPF. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction to the field of astrobiology, and to the search for life on other planets. Chapters 2 and 3 ask, \"What are the best places in the Universe to search for Earth-like life?\" A class of stars, \"habstars,\" is defined as stellar systems that are potentially habitable to Earth-like complex life. The physical properties of habstars are derived from the biological requirement of habitable zone stability, and these properties are translated into observable characteristics. In Chapter 2, the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems (HabCat), containing ~17,000 \"habstars\" within 300 parsecs, is presented for use as a new target list for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence with the Allen Telescope Array. In Chapter 3, HabCat is augmented with other targets of interest, including a list of ~250,000 stars within 1000 parsecs from the Tycho-2 Catalog that are likely to be main-sequence (based on their proper motions) F, G, K and M stars (based on their B-V colors), old open clusters, and the nearest 100 stars.  \n  \r\nWith over 17,000 NEARBY habitable stellar systems it is quite possible that one of them has life on it. Furthermore as the number one factor of life on earth is considered to be water and of the 8 planets we know that Mercury reportedly has water in protected craters. Venus at one point had water. Earth has water. Mars has icecaps and 0.03% H20 in its atmosphere. Jupiter has trace ammounts of water in its atmosphere. Saturn also has trace amounts in the atmosphere and its rings are primarily composed of water. Uranus has no water and Neptune supposedly has water in its middle layers. And of the 3 dwarf planets we know that pluto is made of 30% water ice, Ceres hasn't been visited yet, and neither has Eris. Furthermore the moons: Ganymede, Mimas, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Puck, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, Stephano, Trinculo, Triton, all have a percentage of water ice on them or are primarily made of such and the moons: Phobos, Europa (possibly 50 km depth of liquid water under the surface), Charon all probably have some amount of water.  \n  \r\nWith the above in mind it is more than likely that at least a few of the 17,000 nearby potentially habitable stellar bodies have water on them and are close enough to an energy source to create the right conditions for life.  \n  \r\nThus I have no choice but to negate my opponents comments and point out the logical fallacy. Of the 8 planets that we can readily observe 1 of them definitely has life. As this is the only empirical evidence we have the likely observation would be that 1 in 8 planets have life. Therefor my opponents case stating this is so entirely unlikely that it is not even possible is completely and utterly flawed. It is more than possible and highly likely that there is a stellar body out there with intelligent life.", "category": "Science", "round": 0, "debate_id": "Do-other-intelligent-lifeforms-exist-in-the-universe/1/", "idx": 9729}

The reaction between aluminum and plaster (the important ingredient in which is calcium sulfate) is quite similar to that of thermite.

I ask that the voters set aside their personal bias and evaluate the facts. The Pro-Abortion movement, as I will explain, is not for a choice but for condemnation of a life they seem to be unfit. In this debate we must first decide when does life begin psychically and legally. We physically see the building blocks of life beginning at conception when the male sperm makes contact with the female egg. Life officially has received it's essential foundation to begin at this point. Physically , life has now begun it's journey. After being fertilized, the egg then travels and burrows itself into the uterine wall, this provides the essential housing for the growing life. At the fifth week, the life is now moving into the form of a baby. The brain, heart, and other vitals are now being formed at this point in the stage of life. Keep in mind, most women are just now finding out they are late on their period and by this time are taking pregnancy tests. The fifth week of human life is essential to what defines us as being alive because it is during this time the life is official, it has a heart beat. When we go to the hospital for serious reasons we are fitted with a heart beat monitor. This is vital for the doctors to know because it lets them know if you're on the verge of death. As humans, we judge life by the heart beat. A heart is formed at 18 days old and after 21 days the life in the womb has a heartbeat and can be seen on an ultrasound. -J.M. Tanner, G. R. Taylor, and the Editors of Time-Life Books, Growth, New York: Life Science Library, 1965, p. When a heart beat stops, we pronounce the patient legally dead. When we kill the human fetus, even at 21 days, we are taking a heartbeat and legally killing the life. At 21 days we can without a single notion of doubt say there is a life. By 8 weeks, sex organs are starting to form and the male sex organ will start to show if it is indeed a male. By the end of the third month, the hands and feet are not only formed but moving, acknowledging the notion that the baby is conscious of it's body. I have now laid out the foundation and formation of life in a simple form for the audience and must ask, how can life be a choice? Life is an organized preordained event as I have shown in the first 3 months alone. It should be noted, by common sense alone, that late-term abortion is without a doubt murdering the fully formed conscious child seeing that the child can survive without the mother and in most cases without medical care after 7 months from conception. I am not debating the circumstances of conception, whether it be rape of incest, I am debating when does life begin and how their mothers choose to kill their own child. I set forth the notion that abortion is not only unnatural but a man made murder and the propaganda that tells you other wise is making a cowardly attempt at making money on the blood of the unborn.

I will now leave the floor open to my opponent.", "label": 0, "author": "ConsciousSpirit", "original_text": "\n  \r\nIn this debate I will voice for those whom have a voice that cannot be heard. I ask that the voters set aside their personal bias and evaluate the facts. The Pro-Abortion movement, as I will explain, is not for a choice but for condemnation of a life they seem to be unfit. In this debate we must first decide when does life begin psychically and legally.  \n  \r\nWe physically see the building blocks of life beginning at conception when the male sperm makes contact with the female egg. Life officially has received it's essential foundation to begin at this point. Physically , life has now begun it's journey. After being fertilized, the egg then travels and burrows itself into the uterine wall, this provides the essential housing for the growing life.  \n  \r\nAt the fifth week, the life is now moving into the form of a baby. The brain, heart, and other vitals are now being formed at this point in the stage of life. Keep in mind, most women are just now finding out they are late on their period and by this time are taking pregnancy tests. The fifth week of human life is essential to what defines us as being alive because it is during this time the life is official, it has a heart beat.  \n  \r\nWhen we go to the hospital for serious reasons we are fitted with a heart beat monitor. This is vital for the doctors to know because it lets them know if you're on the verge of death. As humans, we judge life by the heart beat. A heart is formed at 18 days old and after 21 days the life in the womb has a heartbeat and can be seen on an ultrasound. -J.M. Tanner, G. R. Taylor, and the Editors of Time-Life Books, Growth, New York: Life Science Library, 1965, p.  \n  \r\nWhen a heart beat stops, we pronounce the patient legally dead. When we kill the human fetus, even at 21 days, we are taking a heartbeat and legally killing the life. At 21 days we can without a single notion of doubt say there is a life. By 8 weeks, sex organs are starting to form and the male sex organ will start to show if it is indeed a male. By the end of the third month, the hands and feet are not only formed but moving, acknowledging the notion that the baby is conscious of it's body.  \n  \r\nI have now laid out the foundation and formation of life in a simple form for the audience and must ask, how can life be a choice? Life is an organized preordained event as I have shown in the first 3 months alone. It should be noted, by common sense alone, that late-term abortion is without a doubt murdering the fully formed conscious child seeing that the child can survive without the mother and in most cases without medical care after 7 months from conception. I am not debating the circumstances of conception, whether it be rape of incest, I am debating when does life begin and how their mothers choose to kill their own child. I set forth the notion that abortion is not only unnatural but a man made murder and the propaganda that tells you other wise is making a cowardly attempt at making money on the blood of the unborn.  \n  \r\nAbortion has become a business, as noted by \"clinics\" and corporate organizations such as planned parenthood who have a vested interest setting forth the pro-abortion movement. I ask the audience to put aside the bias of classification of murder and acknowledge the presence of life in the womb and how this life, like your life, must be protected under not only natural but federal law.

C) The prison system does not condone the act of rape. D) The prison system is not able to be held accountable of illegal activity, but should strive to prevent it. [Prostitution is ILLEGAL] This is where I could end the debate, but I am choosing not to. The fact that prostituting, pimping, or purchasing services gets you jail time and that it would be hypocritical for the government to sponsor the same thing that it sent people to jail for, kind of ends the argument. -But again, I'm humoring the debate and I think that Pro should have stated this being a \"hypothetical: If prostitution were legal\" scenario in the opening.

B) Less beatings or rapes of prostitutes does not mean it is the desired outcome. The desired outcome should be ZERO. C) Disregarding the people who went to jail for prostitution charges, it would present a big issue for sexual assaulter, rapist, and murderers to get these prostitutes as it would seem both rewarding and a danger to the prostitutes safety. 2.

Based on the above definition, psychedelics ARE drugs. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, drug and alcohol abuse continues to be the second leading cause of injury-related deaths in the US. While one may argue that individuals can learn valuable lessons from their experiences with drugs, the potential for harm to oneself and others is undeniable. Legalizing drugs will only increase accessibility and thusly, the number of people who become addicted or harmed due to its usage. Even if some individuals benefit from experimenting with drugs, creating laws that allow for its widespread availability is irresponsible and dangerous.

Based on the definition of \u201cdrug\u201d that YOU gave me, psychedelics ARE drugs. According to <http://www.drugabuse.gov>, drug and alcohol abuse continues to be the second leading cause of injury death in the United States. While you may argue that individuals can learn valuable lessons from taking these drugs, the potential for harm to themselves and others is undeniable. Even if one learns something from their actions, why would you want our government to create something that countless studies have proven to be detrimental to society? You were fortunate enough to survive your experience, yet many people are not so lucky. Conclusion: Drugs DO have some beneficial outcomes, but the risks far exceed the rewards. Numerous scientific studies have demonstrated that the negative impacts of drugs vastly outweigh the positives. For example, according to the same source mentioned above, drug-related arrests account for more than half of the prison population in the US. This clearly shows how dangerous drugs can be, both physically and mentally. Therefore, I believe that legalising drugs is not the right solution. It might seem like a progressive idea at first glance, but when looked at through a wider lens, the consequences of doing so become clear.

It went something like this. Tom's parents were a huge fan of brainwashing, a fact that Tom was very proud of. However, it meant that when he told stories about it in school his friends would get jealous and steal things from him. One day when his friend Tim stole Tom's casserole something inside Tom broke. He grabbed a spork and stabbed at Tim, not meaning any real harm, but it cut his wrist open and he died. Tom was charged with assault and sent away to Juvenile Hall. There they took away his books and his brainwashing and left him to rot in a cell for weeks at a time. Throughout this time he was sent to counselor. She was a good woman and an even better social worker, but unfortunately (as Tom says) they never are able to reach anyone. During his stay, the warden provided a new benefit for the inmates: they were given books to read on bullying and they were shown websites about bullying. The iron shutters of the roof on the prison shook with the might of their riots as they protested this action. Then, just as the courts decided they were lost causes and sentence them to death, the Warden was struck with an idea that was so crazy, it might just work. She dove into the archives and searched for days on end until finally she found it. She took a stack of binders and slammed it upon the court's floor to draw attention above all the contesting voices. She then solemnly approached the first boy and after she got the court's attention, started to punch and kick the bully, until there was severe bruising. He went back to school in CA and was on the honor role for 3 years. One by one she went, the folders of the original records of the boy's misdemeanors in one hand and various bullying tools in the other. One boy ended up going to Harvard and another won three Pulitzer awards.

As it is, the underfunding of these agencies have resulted in screening gaps that have led to a number of deaths I could only chalk up to agricultural/pharmaceutical malpractice that has even been willful at times. Professionalism in these agencies requires making it a career instead of a 4- or 6-year job. Are police departments, fire departments and public hospitals equally as abusive to Pro because they are not elected bureaus either? Unfortunately, this is only a 2-round debate, so I will not get to read and respond to any remarks Pro has to say about it within the confines of the bonafide debate. I am most definitely baffled and curious as to whether (and if so, how) Pro differentiates local emergency services from federal bureaus. In terms of \"bureaus are abusive,\" unless one is restricting to singular charges against specific bureaus for specific reasons, one cannot pick and choose \"I like X bureau, but do not like Y.\" The constitution does not allow women to vote nor have equal rights. Unless an ERA amendment finally passes, should women being allowed to vote or any federal gender-equality legislations also be considered abusive? Also, didn't President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation violate the pro-slavery Constitution of the time? Lincoln must be one of the most abusive presidents of all time in your book for doing that. Bits and pieces ... The Constitution is not the law. The FDA, EPA and other federal bureaus act on behalf of elected representatives. Legislators, presidents and justices tend to be very smart people, but its impractical to consider them experts on anything, and a nation as large as the United States cannot rely on a president and vice president and a couple hundred Congresspersons to be able to effectively regulate federal minimum guidelines for things like the minimum wage, certification that a drug is safe and effective or environmental laws. States can and do override these minimum guidelines to establish higher ones ... several states (California, for example) have higher minimum wage standards. California also has tougher environmental protections, especially in terms of pollution from automobiles. Power is thus not taken away, merely federal minimum standards are applied. There's no Constitutional declaration of \"Murder is a federal offense.\" Thus, federal prosecutions for murder are Constitutionally abusive just as much as federal bureaus carrying out their functions without having to make time for political campaigns every 4-6 years. Or do you think it right to pick and choose what is or is not abusive in your book? Things like FDA and EPA regulations and enforcement are an infringement on absolute freedom, but absolute freedom is not just. If you want to live in a world where one state can declare it is okay to poison kids with toxic chemicals if a CEO is making a buck off it, then go ahead, seek to dismantle the EPA. If you want to live in a world like China where bureaus for public benefit are a joke and products like baby milk formula can come to market even when watered down with cheap toxic fillers, then go ahead, seek to dismantle the FDA. It is simply unreasonable to leave it to the states to agree to common minimum standards when interests common between states should be handled by the federal government, with federal authority. == REBUTTAL ON \"OVERBEARING TAXES\" == The profiteering by domestic oil cartels is obscene. They choked out the rest of the country, including most businesses and individuals. A lot of businesses completely shut down, costing a lot of people their jobs because of their greed and obscene profits. The oil companies' \"happiness\" was due to capitalistic abuse that bled everyone else in the country dry, including the government with a majority of its population having a lot less money to pay in taxes. It was, in my book, a very reasonable measure to compensate for the obscene tax breaks given to the nation's wealthies (wherein a lot of record-profit oil companies paid taxes equivelant to the low single digits, far less proportionally than, say, a middle-class family who struggled with bills and a rapidly tripled-or-more energy bills). The runaway greed of the cartels (domestic oil companies as much as foreign, mind you!) endangered not only the independence of the American People and the viability of the American economy. Its the equivelant of a small group of people using every drop of water from the Mississippi, and yet Pro would cry foul if the government attempted to intervene as people had no water to drink, river transportation was left useless on a dry river bed and no fishing to be had either (or farming, or anything else dependent on the river). We find laws, on occasion, that are wrong and unjust and though a person might technically violate them, our system can contest the justness of questionable laws. By the same token, I consider it only fair that people who do things that, while not technically illegal, place a massive, tremendous strain and undue burden on the rest of the population, and I cannot think of a much worse example in recent history than the oil profiteers that decimated the remainder of the American economy.

My contentions were not attacked and are therefore sustained; Con did not contest that there are worthwhile missions that moon base could accomplish. He did not contest that the costs of the project are reasonable in view of the objectives of combatting global warming, providing long term energy to Earth, performing valuable scientific research, and building an infrastructure for low cost space refueling. Con\u2019s arguments are confined to technical feasibility. Con claims that a moon base cannot be sustained. I will answer each of his objections. Con Contention 1: Con claims that life on the moon cannot be sustained without replenishing the oxygen, and that was proved by Biosphere II. I never proposed that the base be sustained without replenishment. In the cost section I explicitly allowed $40 billion per year to operate the base and that includes ample replenishment. However, I provided evidence in Pro contention 2 that there is plenty of water on the moon, and that oxygen is readily derived from the water. At the time of the Biosphere experiments, they didn't know that there was so much water on the moon, so their assumption that the base had to be completely self-sufficient was false.  \nCC 2: Con correctly claims that protection from radiation is necessary for a moon base, and his source gives one solution to that problem, which is to use lunar dust to protect the base. The plan proposed for the Shackleton Crater Expedition [P6] has most of the habitat underground to provide protection from radiation hazards. All space missions face radiation hazards, including the long term habitation of the International Space Station. The Space Station is protected only by the thin metal of the structure, but it's acceptable for periods of up to a year. The moon base would have substantially better shielding, being buried in the lunar soil. However, it's proven that excursions outside the base can be sustained, because astronauts have already accomplished that. When extreme solar flares occur, astronauts must retreat to the shelter. That's the practice on current space missions. While the base on the moon would be sustained for decades, the crew would be rotated at something like nine month intervals. That's not for survival, it's to preserve morale. \nCC 3: Con argues that microgravity causes bone loss due to inactivity. The moon is not a low gravity environment, not the microgravity environment of Earth orbit. The low gravity means that greater masses can be lifted and it's possible to move greater distances with the same amount of effort. A space suit itself is heavy and unlike the orbital environment the weight would be borne. If bone loss occurs at all, it would likely be much less than in orbit. However, crew rotation every nine months would ensure that there are no serious lasting effects. \nCC 4: Con argues that new heavy lift rocket would have to be developed to make a moon base more economic. Con's source puts the cost at $5 billion. I allotted $200 billion for the start-up costs, which covers the cost of a new rocket. NASA is already developing the rocket for deep space exploration, so it's not an issue. [P15. <URL>... ] \nCC 5: Con argues that there is plenty of room on Earth to sustain a larger population, so there is no need for a moon colony to support population growth. I agree.

Con\u2019s arguments are limited to technical feasibility; Con claims that a manned mission to Mars cannot be sustained. I will address each of his objections. Con Contention 1: Con claims that life on Mars cannot be sustained without replenishing the atmosphere, and this has been disproved by BIOSPHERE II.

In the Cost Section, I explicitly allocated $40 billion per year to operate the mission and this includes adequate atmospheric replenishment. However, Con\u2019s source did not take into account the fact that there is now abundant evidence of water on Mars and that oxygen can be derived from the water. At the time of the BIOSPHERE II experiment, they did not know that there was so much water on Mars, thus their assumption that the mission had to be completely autonomous was incorrect.  \nCC2: Con correctly points out that protection from radiation is necessary for a manned mission to Mars, and his source suggests one way to achieve this \u2013 using Martian regolith to shield the habitat. The plan proposed for the SHACKLETON CRATER EXPEDITION (P6) has most of the habitation underground to provide protection from radiation hazards. All space missions face radiation hazards, including the long-term habitation of the International Space Station. The Space Station is protected only by the thin metal of its structure, yet it is still accepted for durations of up to a year. The Mars mission would have significantly better shielding, being buried in the Martian soil. However, extended excursions outside the base can still be sustained, as astronauts have already achieved this feat during the Apollo program. When extreme solar flares occur, astronauts must retreat to the shelter. This is standard procedure for any prolonged exposure to extreme levels of radiation. \nCC3: Con argues that microgravity leads to bone loss due to lack of activity. The Mars mission is not a low-gravity environment, nor is it an orbiting microgravity environment; rather, it is a planetary gravity environment. The lower mass can be lifted and movement distances increased with the same amount of effort. A space suit itself is heavy and unlike the orbital environment, the weight would be borne by the crew. If bone loss should occur, it would likely be much less than in orbit.

Con's arguments are confined to technical feasibility. Con claims that a moon base cannot be sustained. I will answer each of his objections.  Con Contention 1   Con claims that life on the moon cannot be sustained without replenishing the oxygen, and that was proved by Biosphere II. I never proposed that the base be sustained without replenishment. In the cost section I explicitly allowed $40 billion per year to operate the base and that include ample replenishment. However, I provided evidence in Pro contention 2 that there is plenty of water on the moon, and that oxygen is readily derived from the water. At the time of the Biosphere experiments, they didn't know that there was so much water on the moon, so their assumption that the base had to be completely self-sufficient was false.  CC 2   Con correctly claims that protection from radiation is necessary for a moon base, and his source gives one solution to that problem, which is to use lunar dust to protect the base. The plan proposed for the Shackleton Crater Expedition [P6] has most of the habitation underground to provide protection from radiation hazards.  All space missions face radiation hazards, including the long term habitation of the International Space Station. The Space Station is protected only by the thin metal of the structure, but it's acceptable for periods of up to a year. The moon base would have substantially better shielding, being buried in the lunar soil. However, it's proven that excursions outside the base can be sustained, because astronauts have already accomplished that. When extreme solar flares occur, astronauts must retreat to the shelter. That's the practice on current space missions.  While the base on the moon would be sustained for decades, the crew would be rotated at something like nine month intervals. That's not for survival, it's to preserve morale.  CC 3   Con argues that microgravity causes bone loss due to inactivity. The moon is not a low gravity environment, not the microgravity environment of earth orbit. the low gravity means that greater masses can be lifted and it' possible to move greater distances with the same amount of effort. A space suit itself is heavy and unlike the orbital environment the weight would be born. If bone loss occurs at al, it would likely be much less than in orbit. However, crew rotation every nine months would ensure that there are no serious lasting effects.  CC 4   Con argues that new heavy lift rocket would have to be developed to make a moon base more economic. Con's source put the cost at $5 billion. I allotted $200 billion for the startup costs, which covers the cost of a new rocket. NASA is already developing the rocket for deep space exploration, so it's not an issue. [P15.   http://www.nasa.gov...   ]  CC 5   Con argues that there is plenty of room on earth to sustain a larger population, so there is no need for a moon colony to support population growth. I agree. I never argued that a moon base was needed to support population growth. I gave the purposes explicitly, and Con did not dispute them as being valid.  Con granted the reasons for building a moon base and the cost effectiveness. His technical objections are minor, and I have answered them.

The affirmative is wrong in that recycling decreases demand for paper.  \n  \r\n1. The demand for paper is constantly rising as the population rises.  \n  \r\n2. At worst, reycling would cause no more commercial forests to be planted (and these forests are not that good, as proven later).  \n  \r\n3. Because it will end up balancing, recycling is not harming the environment, and this point of the affirmative's is null.  \n  \r\nII. Why recycling helps the environment.  \n  \r\n1. To begin with, I will say that trees from naturally growing forests are important to the climate whereas those made by companies are not as beneficial.  \n  \r\nA. They are made quickly, as to maximize profit, require massive amounts of fertilizer, and will soon be cut down. They also do not manage carbon dioxide as well as other trees since their only purpose is to be made into paper.  \r\nB. Because of this, they are only temporarily beneficial to the environment, whereas \"virgin trees\", or natural forests (or any forest that has been established for awhile) are far more beneficial.  \r\nC. Because these forests will not be cut down, they continuously manage carbon dioxide levels.  \r\nD. These trees also have spread their roots, and in doing so, can provide more managing of carbon dioxide. As well, this root system helps prevent erosion, and these forests generally have more biodiversity.  \n  \r\nSo in essence, trees grown by corporations are not grown to help manage carbon dioxide, but to be made into paper. Trees that have been planted otherwise contribute more to the environment.  \n  \r\n2. The earth's population is in a state of rapid expansion. This means the consumption of paper will continually rise, and, the amount of land needed for farming rise as well.  \n  \r\nA. This necessary increase in farming land will mean that more and more land efficiency will be required.  \r\nB. Because much of this growth is less developed countries, there will not be companies planting trees (which obviously are not that useful to the environment anyway).  \r\nC. Many native forests will be cut down, and this will increase climate change.  \n  \r\n3. This can be prevented by encouraging recycling.  \n  \r\nA. The affirmative might object by saying that corporations for planting trees should be made, however...  \r\nB. Recycling paper is cheaper than making new paper.  \r\nC. These poorer countries would therefore it would be in that countries interests to recycle rather than to engage in a new commercial industry (which again, is not that beneficial in regulating carbon dioxide).  \r\nD.

It has only existed since the industrial revolution began c.1800. This is my third premise. It causes war, destuction and crime--my fourth premise. I'll do my best to stick to these main points and in the order as above. P1) In September of 2008 the global markets crashed with, as we all know, disastrous consequences. But this was not an isolated event caused by a couple of gung-ho, irresponsible bankers who lost control temporarily. There have been dozens of recessions over the last twohundred years, arguably the most notorious in America being the wall street crash of the late 1920s and the recession in the 1980s being the most notorious in Britain. So in that sence the current world leaders ought to bare no blame. In the current system recessions are clearly inevitable. But, I'm sure you'll agree, a system that hosts a recession every few years isn't a system that works. Now; to cure a recession you need to get the banks trading again and to do this the banks need money. You must ask yourself: where will the money come from? The only two European countries that are barely keeping there heads above the water are France and Germany but even they can't afford to lend much more money. In south America you have countries that have never done well to sustain an economy, Mexico and Canada can't afford too loan money and the USA is getting closer to the condition that Greece, Ireland and Portugal are in every day. So want about Asia? Japan was driven back into recession by the nuclear disaster in Fukoshima south Korea has no money to give and china is already owed billions of dollars by the USA. African and middle eastern countries have no real economy as their best assets are already owned by the west. So unless the matins lend us a couple of trillion dollars these recessions are going to carry on happening every few decades. But let's ask ourselves where the money is. Money doesn't just disappear overnight. What's happened is the money is in the hands of a few billionaires who have continued to get richer despite the recession. You may argue that these enourmous anounts of money are necessary to create an incentive for production, that, for example, people would no longer develop technology if they werent treated as better, more elite people for it. But I ask you: would you decide to no longer work or invent things if you weren't paid extortionate amounts of money to do so? Would you go back to living in the medieval ages just because you couldn't have a swimming pool in your house? Our curiosity, imagination and injenuity extends back to times far before the invention of capitalism, back, even, to times before money was invented. No-one paid the cave men to paint. No-one paid for the invention of fire or the Cerne Abbis Giant in Cornwall or the neolithic tombs of the British Isles. or the numerous other feates of human capability throughout history and the world. Money is about greed, not motivation. P2)Despite the fact that I got a bit off course in my first premise I've lead myself neatly into my second premise. Not only would I say that capitalism is not an incentive for creativity - I would go as far as to say it stunts creativity. Why are there so few Bill Gates? Surely there are more people than that with the knowledge to create a business. Well, there are. The problem is people can't afford to create their own products, literature, art etc. This makes sense. For more billionaires to be created current billionaires would have to sacrifice money. Not something they'd be too keen on, is it? So, by definition not every-one can succeed. P3)I've already explained that capitalism is a new thing and isn't peoples incentive to invent and be productive, so I won't elaborate further on that point. P4)As I've already explained: not every-one can succeed in a capitalist society. So if, like at the moment, hundreds of thousands of people across the world find themselves unemployed--what are their options? They are offered social security; a small amount of money designed to merely keep people alive. But this simply isn't good enough for people who are capable of work and want to work. Some people think its their fault theyre unemployed and think that they must deal with the consequences and suffer. Others, though find themselves alienated from the system and gang culture increases. People who could be working end up vandalising and terrorising communities. The government plays this to their advantage by putting people into the prison system and hence the public think that crime is being fought. But the only long term solution to crime is to end unemployment--which capitalism can't do. My final premise is war. Capitalism has always started wars. Did Sadam Hussein posses weapons of mass destruction? No. He had oil. America needs oil--it's worth billions of dollars to them every year. But they couldnt stop at Iraq. They claimed that terrorism was Americas greatest threat. So they had to carry on fighting terrorism or face the consequences for starting a war under false pretensions. They invaded Afghanistan and carried on killing innocent civilians whilst getting the odd radical as-well. Now they want to invade Iran. And what are they accusing Iran of?

And people forget that, that's why I started this debate. \" Some cubans did. Not all cubans. Plus, a similar proportion of germans supported hitler as cubans supported castro. Since we have already established that Hitler is not a national hero, being supported initially by a given number of your populace is not enough to make you a hero. \"Well if I didn't state that limit then you'd argue George Washington is braver than Fidel. 1st of all the time they live in makes that argument impossible. 2nd of all, all Americans would vote against me due to their patriotism and love for George Washington.\" That's entirely irrelevant. This does not give you an excuse to bar evidence. You cannot simultaneously argue that Castro was braver than ALL US presidents and bar evidence about most of those that weren't. Also, in the twentieth century I rather think Eisenhower has a shot, even though I dislike a number of things about him. :D. \" Haha! You make me laugh. John McCain being tortured doesn't make him brave at all. Did he choose to be tortured? No. Were the Vietnamese agreeing to stop torturing him if he had given them information they wanted? No. He had no choice! \" Last I checked it was implied that the torture would stop if the vietnamese received what they wanted. \" I did not suppose that Castro's administration was positive, I'd be pretty insolent to suppose that. However, I did suppose that actions made by him in order to gain power in Cuba were positive, and many of his actions were BRAVE. \" See your first round: \"these were the best 49 years Cuba has ever had for a long time. \" That seems to suppose positivity to me. \" 1st of all, I am not defending Fidel's administration. Second of all get you facts straight, Fidel's a socialist, not a communist. Giving the middle finger to America is heroism. It's like giving the middle finger to a boss that overworks you. Except America was the kind of boss that would kill you.\" He leads the Communist Party of Cuba. If he were not a communist, he would not allow the party he leads to be called such. Also, can you clarify what distinction you see between socialism and communism? Because every socialist and/or communist I talk to has a different definition of the term. I've heard self-described communists declaring the soviet union or cuba or whatever was/is not socialist but communist, or not communist but socialist, and I've heard each of the same from self-described socialists, and NONE of them were willing to give a coherent definition. Marx has several definitions for each term, many of them contradictory. If you are going to join them in supposing the semantic distinction, please help clean up the mess a bit by clarifying this. Please? If America were the \"kind of boss that would kill you\" as you claim, Castro would be dead. What they were were an enemy. A boss has a presupposed victory. Plus, I do not consider giving the middle finger to a boss that holds you to your contract to be heroism, so your analogy demonstrates nothing. Even giving the middle finger to someone who deserves it isn't heroism, it's just a hand gesture. Heroism requires positive achievement under difficult conditions. In order to be a national hero, your achievement has to be positive for the nation in question. \" Why would Cubans not consider him a hero after all he did for Cuba, liberating Cuba from Batista, and indirectly liberating Cuba from America?\" False premise behind your question. He did not \"liberate\" cuba from anyone. He eliminated one master and then replaced them.

Now if you want to argue \"everyone who is brave AND does not perpetuate a holocaust is a hero,\" that's fine, but it is not your resolution.  \n  \r\n\"If you actually read my whole argument you'd see that Cubans DID support Fidel Castro's cause. And people forget that, that's why I started this debate.  \r\n\"  \n  \r\nSome cubans did. Not all cubans. Plus, a similar proportion of germans supported hitler as cubans supported castro. Since we have already established that Hitler is not a national hero, being supported initially by a given number of your populace is not enough to make you a hero.  \n  \r\n\"Well if I didn't state that limit then you'd argue George Washington is braver than Fidel. 1st of all the time they live in makes that argument impossible. 2nd of all, all Americans would vote against me due to their patriotism and love for George Washington.\"  \n  \r\nThat's entirely irrelevant. This does not give you an excuse to bar evidence. You cannot simultaneously argue that Castro was braver than ALL US presidents and bar evidence about most of those that weren't.  \n  \r\nAlso, in the twentieth century I rather think Eisenhower has a shot, even though I dislike a number of things about him. :D.  \n  \r\n\"  \r\nHaha! You make me laugh. John McCain being tortured doesn't make him brave at all. Did he choose to be tortured? No. Were the Vietnamese agreeing to stop torturing him if he had given them information they wanted? No. He had no choice!  \r\n\"  \n  \r\nLast I checked it was implied that the torture would stop if the vietnamese received what they wanted.  \n  \r\n\"  \r\nI did not suppose that Castro's administration was positive, I'd be pretty insolent to suppose that. However, I did suppose that actions made by him in order to gain power in Cuba were positive, and many of his actions were BRAVE.  \r\n\"  \n  \r\nSee your first round:  \n  \r\n\"these were the best 49 years Cuba has ever had for a long time.  \r\n\"  \r\nThat seems to suppose positivity to me.  \n  \r\n\"  \r\n1st of all, I am not defending Fidel's administration. Second of all get you facts straight, Fidel's a socialist, not a communist. Giving the middle finger to America is heroism. It's like giving the middle finger to a boss that overworks you. Except America was the kind of boss that would kill you.\"  \n  \r\nHe leads the Communist Party of Cuba. If he were not a communist, he would not allow the party he leads to be called such. Also, can you clarify what distinction you see between socialism and communism? Because every socialist and/or communist I talk to has a different definition of the term. I've heard self-described communists declaring the soviet union or cuba or whatever was/is not socialist but communist, or not communist but socialist, and I've heard each of the same from self-described socialists, and NONE of them were willing to give a coherent definition. Marx has several definitions for each term, many of them contradictory. If you are going to join them in supposing the semantic distinction, please help clean up the mess a bit by clarifying this. Please?  \n  \r\nIf America were the \"kind of boss that would kill you\" as you claim, Castro would be dead. What they were were an enemy. A boss has a presupposed victory.  \n  \r\nPlus, I do not consider giving the middle finger to a boss that holds you to your contract to be heroism, so your analogy demonstrates nothing. Even giving the middle finger to someone who deserves it isn't heroism, it's just a hand gesture.  \n  \r\nHeroism requires positive achievement under difficult conditions. In order to be a national hero, your achievement has to be positive for the nation in question.  \n  \r\n\"  \r\nWhy would Cubans not consider him a hero after all he did for Cuba, liberating Cuba from Batista, and indirectly liberating Cuba from America?\"  \n  \r\nFalse premise behind your question. He did not \"liberate\" cuba from anyone. He eliminated one master and then replaced them. Not for a moment could cuba be considered \"liberated.\"  \n  \r\nThe wise in cuba will not put the label of hero to he who continued their enslavement far longer than the previous master could have, however much chutzpah it may have taken to do so.", "category": "Politics", "round": 1, "debate_id": "Fidel-Castro-is-and-will-always-be-Cuba-s-national-hero-because-he-s-got-balls./1/", "idx": 12181}

Rebuttal: Imposing stricter regulation on gun ownership may not necessarily lead to reduced crime rates.

Rebuttal Okay. Given that you believe that total ban on cigarettes is not the way forward, let me present to you some reasons why you have failed in this debate. First, history has shown that when governments try to enforce extreme measures such as banning certain products, it often leads to increased criminal activity and unintended consequences such as creating a thriving black market. Second, your proposed solution lacks feasibility; how exactly do you plan to implement such a sweeping change? Third, your expectations of the outcome are too optimistic; even if enforcement were possible, there is no guarantee that a total ban would reduce the number of smokers or improve public health overall. Fourth, you have neglected to mention any potential alternatives to a total ban, such as increasing taxes on cigarettes or encouraging smokers to switch to safer alternatives. Finally, all of the sources you presented regarding the risks associated with smoking are relevant to the topic at hand since we are discussing the effects of smoking, regardless of whether it is legal or illegal.

However, \"The Antiquities\", is not the only place Josephus writes of Jesus he also writes of him in \"Testimonium Flavianum\" It is not uncommon for someone to written about well after their passing and if Josephus was the only writer to mention Jesus then I would agree that maybe something is fishy, CON however seems to then also deny the writings of Tactis (a Roman Historian), Pliny the Younger (a Roman Senator), Phlegon (a secular historian), Origen (a Roman Historian) and The Talmud. All of which refer to Jesus in one form another. CON next questions the concept of why no one from Jesus writes of him, CON must have never read the Bible for that is all it talks about. With further statements CON implies that if Jesus was then someone should have written of Him other then the writers of the Bible, why would this be true? Just because He, Jesus, had a large following you think that historians of the day would write about Him, a carpenter from Nazareth? The historians of the times only wrote of the aristocrats not the normal Joe on the street, what is most remarkable indeed is that any historian would write of Jesus, but as cited above many wrote of Him, why? How can this simple man make such a mark that history would even see him? Finally, CON asks where is the artifacts of this man to show that he even lived? Before I answer that the biggest question is again why would a simple persons artifacts even important. Why would a commoner even be considered by history to be important enough to look for artifacts, it is obvious that Jesus was more then that just by the writings of the historians from the time frame to take note of Him he must have made some type of mark on the world. However you would hope to find some type of artifact that showed he was alive, in 2002 a remarkable find was unearthed. The find was an ossuary; a small box used between 20 and 70 AD for burials, upon this ossuary in Aramaic was the inscription, \"James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.\" (1) So where CON claims there is no artifacts that refer to Jesus there is this ossuary. So then what do historians of today say is Jesus a real historical person? To sum up, modern critical methods fail to support the Christ-myth theory. It has \"again and again been answered and annihilated by first-rank scholars.\" In recent years \"no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non-historicity of Jesus\"\"or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary. (Michael Grant author of numerous books on ancient history)(2) The total evidence is so overpowering, so absolute that only the shallowest of intellects would dare to deny Jesus\" existence. (Paul L. Maier, historian and novelist)(3) \"The Christian evidence for Christ begins with the letters ascribed to Saint Paul....No one has questioned the existence of Paul, or his repeated meetings with Peter, James, and John; and Paul enviously admits that these men had known Christ in his flesh. . . That a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so loft an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the Gospel.\" (Will Durant, American writer historian and philosopher)(4) Given this data and the writing thru history, and the vast majority of historians it is only logical to believe that yes Jesus walked this earth and died around 36 AD.

{"basic": "\nArgument: The argument I'm making is not about religion filling a void. I am saying that religion does provide answers to questions, but not the same questions as science. Ignorance is a constant. We will never know everything because it is impossible. We are ignorant regardless of science or religion. But both provide answers to certain questions. Religion isn't the opposite of science. When science grows, religion doesn't shrink. Religion gives an understanding of yourself but It is different for each person. What is true for you may not be true for me. Just because a man has lots of scientific knowledge, it does not make him less ignorant than a man with spiritual knowledge. But spirit is intangible. It can't be analyzed under a microscope. No one can give you those answers but a religion can give you a path. Who is to say that it is wrong? You mention all of the exclusive attributes of religion But not all Christians are preaching that you are going to Hell. In fact many Christians believe that you don't necessarily have to believe what they do to go to heaven. Instead they are out in the world feeding the homeless and helping others to find their way. They invite people to follow their path because it works for them and makes them happy. That is the evidence that there is something there. They understand way more about the world than someone gathering data from constellations because they live it daily. Their spirit is filled and there is no void. When you ask a priest who you are, he knows he can't give you an answer. But the priest might know himself and he will attempt to give you the same wisdom he found on his path. If you listen or don't, that is up to you. Same goes for any good religious person with real knowledge of the spiritual. I still stick to my analogy of art in the sense that no one can tell you what good art is but you. You choose to see what you want in a painting. Art can be destructive and hateful. Art can be exclusive. Do we make art to fill a void? Maybe some do. But art is abstract. It evolves and changes and some forms become popular while others fade.

(that's how evolusion occurs, someone with a genetic deviance getting their genes prominent in the population)  \n  \r\nbut I don't see these things happening to atheists.  \r\nI see plenty of evidence from chrisitans and to a lesser extent other religious folks. but I don't see it from atheists etc, why is that? they might claim that it's just not as newsworthy or interpreted that way given the lack of religious context etc.  \r\nbut you'd think there's at least be noteworthy evidence, or something, at least, that shows it happens to atheists etc  \n  \r\nalso, even if i acknowledged that they may occur, it would be extremely very small percentage wise.  \r\nas of now i'd be happy with just couple or a few examples.  \n  \r\nive shown some examples happening to theists, it shouldnt be hard to find some happening to atheists.", "category": "Religion", "round": 0, "debate_id": "scientifically-inexplicable-things-occur-that-are-apparently-supernatural-but-not-to-atheists/4/", "idx": 53730}

Firstly, the appeal to authority fallacy occurs when one argues that something is true simply because it is stated in an authoritative source like the holy bible; this type of reasoning is unreliable since there are many other sources that contradict the claims made in the bible. Secondly, the ad hominem attack against those who do not follow the bible\u2019s teachings is also unsound; instead of addressing the issue at hand, this tactic focuses on the character of the person rather than their arguments. Finally, the slippery slope fallacy occurs when one assumes that certain changes will lead to an extreme outcome; while it may be true that changing laws could potentially result in societal decay, this conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise provided.

{"basic": "\nArgument 3: Paying Teachers Based On Student Achievement Is Immoral\nPaying teachers based on student achievement is immoral because it encourages teaching to the test and rewards those who cheat students out of their education. This practice also creates an unhealthy competition between teachers and puts undue pressure on both students and educators. Furthermore, it discourages collaboration among teachers and promotes individualism rather than collective responsibility for student success. Ultimately, rewarding teachers for student performance goes against the idea of public service and sets up an environment where ethical behavior is not valued.", "len_basic": 656, "len_orig": 1693, "ideology": "\nArgument 3 - Against Merit Pay Based On Student Achievement\nI. Introduction \nThis debate centres around whether merit pay based on student achievement should be a significant component of K-12 teacher compensation. The proponent argues that such a system is moral while the opponent contends that it is immoral.  \nII. Definition of Terms \nAchievement: something accomplished, especially by superior ability, special effort, great courage, etc.; a notable success or accomplishment. (<Dictionary.com>) \nSignificance: the quality of having real importance or meaningfulness; significance implies weight or worthiness. (<Dictionary.com>) \nIII. Body \nThe proponent claims that merit pay based on student achievement is moral because it encourages teachers to work harder and reward those who achieve good results. However, this ignores the fact that teachers should be motivated to do their best work without the prospect of financial gain. Additionally, tying teacher salaries to student performance creates an unhealthy competition between students which could lead to increased stress and anxiety. Furthermore, merit pay based on student achievement may discourage collaboration among teachers and create an environment where individuals feel resentful towards one another. Finally, basing teacher pay on student achievement may result in unfairly low wages for some educators, even if they are doing excellent work. \nIV. Conclusion \nIn conclusion, merit pay based on student achievement is immoral due to its potential to create an unhealthy competitive atmosphere, reduce collaboration amongst teachers, and result in unfairly low wages for some educators.", "len_ideology": 1658, "content": "\nArgument 3: Pay Teachers Based On Student Achievement Is Immoral\n##\nThe main premise of this argument is that paying teachers based on student achievement is immoral because it amounts to bribing people to do their jobs. This implies that there is some sort of inherently unethical nature to rewarding performance, which is not true. Rewarding performance is a common practice in many fields and does not necessarily imply coercion or unfairness. Furthermore, if teachers were paid more for achieving higher levels of student success, it could potentially act as an incentive for other teachers to strive for similar results. Ultimately, whether or not to pay teachers based on student achievement is a decision best left up to individual school districts, as what may be considered moral in one place might not be another.", "len_content": 824, "style": "\nArgument 3: Paying Teachers Based On Student Achievement Is Immoral\n##\nThe main premise of this argument is that paying teachers based on student achievement is inherently wrong because it encourages cheating and gaming the system. This puts pressure on teachers to artificially inflate test scores which goes against the spirit of true education. Furthermore, rewarding teachers for performance that may not necessarily reflect their actual abilities could lead to inequality and unfairness. Ultimately, paying teachers based on student achievement sets up an unethical environment where those with less integrity will gain more rewards while those who strive for excellence suffer.", "len_style": 684, "ideology-content": "\nThis argument could also be transformed into an effective argument by making sure the structure follows the standard form. This includes defining key terms at the beginning, presenting arguments in support of the position, rebutting any counterarguments, and summarizing the conclusion.

This is because when students succeed, so too does the teacher. The bonus system provides an additional incentive for teachers to help their students reach high standards. Furthermore, research shows that when teachers are financially rewarded for good performance, it leads to improved results in the classroom. Additionally, financial rewards may also attract more talented individuals into teaching, which could benefit all students. Therefore, I argue that bonusing teachers for student success is both fair and beneficial.  \n      \nRefutation: Opponents of this argument contend that bonusses might lead to unintended consequences such as gaming the system or creating unnecessary stress for teachers and students. Additionally, some worry that bonusses might distract from other forms of recognition or support for excellent teaching. Finally, others point out that there are many ways to recognize and reward excellence besides monetary bonusses.", "len_all": 1130, "text": "I would like to first thank my opponent for the debate.

{"basic": "\nArgument: Why should the U.S. regime be trusted with arms? The corporate media is crying about how Asad allegedly used chemical weapons on \u201chis own people\u201d, and therefore he should be overthrown. Yet, the U.S. regime has been using chemical weapons for a long time. Members of the U.S. military, (shill or not) Dennis Kyne] have come forward and talked about the usage of depleted uranium on civilian populations. Now should we really trust a regime that uses depleted uranium indiscriminately? The Korean, Viet Nam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libyan, and Syrian wars were all started by the U.S. regime alone, even though other aggressors participated. And speaking of Viet Nam, the U.S. regime used many different kinds of chemical weapons there. How come no one called for a regime change then?

I urge the audience to award Con the conduct point. I will divide this round into two sections. First, I shall attack Neg's arguments for negating the resolution. Then, I shall provide reasons of my own for affirming the resolution. ---Con's case--- Con argues that complex extraterrestrial life is uncommon, through attempting to affirm the Rare Earth hypothesis. Given that this is his only avenue of argumentation, were I to succeed in refuting the hypothesis, the audience has no reasons to vote Con in \"arguments\". Let's begin. (a) The Rare Earth hypothesis uses some form of post-hoc reasoning in evaluating the criteria necessary for a planet to sustain complex life. Post-hoc reasoning is a logically fallacious form of reasoning, when one proclaims that \" since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X .\" ( <URL>... ) For instance, the rooster crows immediately before sunrise, therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise. Looking at the criteria necessary for a planet to sustain complex life, as the Rare Earth hypothesis proclaims, it is clear that many, if not all of them rely on some form of post-hoc reasoning that is based on the factors necessary for the rise of complex life on Earth . The astronomer David Darling even proclaims that the Rare Earth hypothesis is mearly an account of some soft, of how complex life arised on Earth ( <URL>... )! To expand on the point pertaining to Rare Earth using post-hoc reasoning, I'm not suggesting that because of this, all of the variables suggested are unreasonable. The variable that claims that a planet must be in a habitable zone, for instance, seems highly reasonable. However, other variables such as \"a large gas giant\" being needed, or \"a large moon\" being needed seem highly unimaginative with regard to what forms of complex life that could possibly exist, given that they only take into account complex life on Earth. Yet, it is possible that on another planet, life would, through evolution, be able to adapt to such variables, or be exempt from them altogether. (b) Secondly, several variables are highly disputable, and are by no means, settled science. To use an example of a variable that has been scientifically disproved altogether, Ward and Brownlee [the founders of the Rare Earth hypothesis], on page 217 of their seminal, aptly titled book \"Rare Earth\" claim that \" there is irrefutable evidence that oxygen is a necessary ingredient for [animal] life\". However, some recently discovered multicellular organisms, such as the Spinoloricus Cinzia, rely on hydrogen, rather than oxygen. Other variables, such as the role of Jupiter, are scientifically dubious, to say the least: \" A study by Horner & Jones (2008) using computer simulation found that while the total effect on all orbital bodies within the Solar System is unclear, Jupiter has caused more impacts on Earth than it has prevented. \" ( <URL>... ) --My case-- I shall provide a short, succint case: First of all, exoplanet research and discovery has almost been limited to just those within the Milky Way. Even within the milky way, the exoplanets that have been discovered are minimal - we have only discovered about 1900 exoplanets. It is thus no suprise at all that we have not discovered any complex extraterrestrial life as of yet. However, by extrapolating from the already discovered exoplanets, as well as other data eg. the amount of stars in the Milky Way, it could be the case, according to a study published in PNAS, that there could be 11 billion planets located in a habitable zone. ( <URL>... ) It also ought to be noted that the Milky Way is just one of 100 or 200 billion galaxies that exist. ( <URL>... ) As such, it is likely that the Universe is teeming with so many planets located in a habitable zone, that even if most of the variables in the Rare Earth hypothesis were to be true [many are probably not] there would still be a significant amount of complex extraterrestrial life existing. The likelihood is even higher, when facing recent developments in the origin of life. Astrobiologist and physicist Paul Davies, in his book the Eerie Silence, describes how recent OOL research developments have swung \"the pendulum the other way [from being highly unlikely to likely]\" with regards to the probability of life originating on a habitable planet.

I would like to mention that I realize I am obligated to fulfill the requirements of the debate stated in round one: namely, \"Please review these issues,\" (\"review\" according to Black's Law Dictionary , \"consideration for purposes of correction\") along with the resolution: \"Resolved, my political views are better than yours.\" Given only the space of 8,000 characters in which to do it, in order to feasibly execute this debate, I created an observation stated within the introduction of my debate that my opponent seems to have overlooked. For the ease of my readers, I will now reiterate that observation. \"In order to satisfy the resolution: \"Resolved: My political views are better than yours,\" we will assume that the way in which I negate my opponent's views constitutes my own.\" When I, in my previous speech, rebutted my opponent's views, I aired my own simply through the way in which I refuted them.\" I will now move on to address some arguments that will help to crystalize the debate and clash with a few of my opponent's more specific criticisms. The majority of my opponent's rebuttal lies in his assertion that I agree with his views. He extracts quotes such as \"I could not agree more with what he states here\" and \"this statement made by my opponent sounds hopeful\" along with \"that it is a noble aim.\" This was said as one might say: \"Although this bill has good intentions, I simply cannot afford to support it.\" Although an end carries importance, it is the means to achieve that end that afford agreement or disagreement. In acknowledging good intentions, one is by no means bound to consensus. I. LEGISLATION: I would like to assure my opponent that I do note his opening statement, however I would like to remind him that this is not all he said. He also stated that the educational system lacks funding, therefore implying that he would wish to additionally fund it. In response to this I would like to reiterate my argument that we should use the funds we have efficiently instead of continually wasting excess funding. II. TAXES: A. My opponent attacks what he believes to be a \"hasty generalization\" on my part, in assuming that his use of \"we\" meant the federal government. I believe that I mentioned when I made this assumption in my first speech, that the reason I had to make this assumption was because my opponents vagueness as to defining \"we\" and his excessive use thereof. B. My opponent suggests that I \"have the concept of capitalism wrong.\" He states that a capitalistic society relies partly on the government. While it may be inevitable for government to somewhat involve themselves in the economy, a capitalist economy, or an \"economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned\" relies not one the government but the private individual. To sum up, the less government, the more pure the capitalist economy. C. My opponent states that he has the right to convey his political views on any level, federal or national. I merely caution my opponent not to use specific and extreme examples in order to justify or argue the whole. III. FISCAL PRIORITIES: My opponent failed to clash with my stance of public-private partnerships which constituted the whole of his \"fiscal priorities\" views. IV. SCHOOLS: This section of the debate revolved largely around public vs. private schools. My opponent, to clash with this, states that he \"never undermined the well-being of private schools.\" In response to this, I can only quote him thus: \"People wouldn't feel the need to enroll their children in private schools.\" V. BUDGET PRIORITES: My opponent did not clash with my arguments pertaining to his budget priorities. VI. TOBACCO LITIGATION: My opponent here simply is not following the line of logic in my argument. Let me reiterate the misinterpreted scenario for purposes of clarification. Given: tobacco companies are mandated by the federal government to adhere a product warning to all their products. Therefore, to give an applicable example, a defective toy sold with the knowledge that it was injuring children would have had an attached warning that told of these effects (just as tobacco is known to cause harm and has proper warning labels). Thus, the company could not be held liable for the idiocy of its customers. VII. SPECIAL INTERESTS: My opponent failed to clash with this section of the debate. VIII. ABORTION: My opponent states that he \"never wanted live human beings to die.\" So does my opponent want human beings to die? Just not \"live\" human beings? So claims his argument. IX. SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: While I'm sure we all thank my opponent for copying and pasting this excerpt from, no doubt, a revered source, this argument has no bearing on his case and in no way clashes with my argument. I did not state that homosexuality was a choice; I did not state that civil unions should not be made legal to all. What I did advocate was for the right of religions to practice said religion without being told by the federal government what marriage they must consider permissible. It is for all the afore-mentioned reasons that I ask for the negation of this resolution. Again, thank you to all judges, readers, and, of course, my so very dedicated opponent. I hope this debate was well worth the time and thought that was so obviously invested in it.

{"basic": "\nI would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. Before I begin, let me just clarify some definitions. When I say \u201ccarnivorous\u201d or \u201comnivorous\u201d, I mean these terms in their strictest sense; meaning someone who eats primarily meat. This includes all forms of mammals, birds, reptiles, etc., including fish. Similarly, vegetarians do not eat any animal products, while vegans avoid animal products and also refrain from consuming certain non-animal derived substances such as dairy, eggs, and certain wines. With this clarification out of the way, I\u2019d like to move onto the main points of this debate.  \n\nMy opponent claims that vegetarianism is more ethical than an omnivorous/carnivorous diet due to its lack of harm towards animals. However, they fail to acknowledge the potential benefits of an omnivorous/carnivorous diet. For example, many cultures around the world consume various amounts of animal based proteins which provide essential nutrients necessary for human growth and development. In addition, animal products can provide important fatty acids which are vital for proper brain functioning. Furthermore, there are certain cultural practices which involve the consumption of animal products, and eliminating them could have detrimental effects on those communities. Therefore, I argue that an omnivorous/carnivorous diet can still be considered ethical despite any potential harms inflicted upon animals.", "len_basic": 1431, "len_orig": 922, "ideology": "\nI would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate. Before I begin, let me just clarify some definitions so there is no confusion later on. When I say \u201ccarnivorous\u201d, I mean someone who eats primarily meat; while \u201cvegetarians\u201d refer to people who do not eat any animal products. Now, onto the actual arguments.  \n\nMy first point is that vegetarianism can actually be more sustainable than an omnivorous or carnivorous diet. This is because plant-based proteins require fewer resources to produce than animal proteins. For example, it takes about 8 pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of beef. Furthermore, raising animals for food produces large amounts of waste and pollutants which can harm our environment. Therefore, going veggie could help us reduce our environmental footprint. \n\nSecondly, vegetarianism has been linked to numerous health benefits such as improved digestion, weight loss, lowered risk of heart disease, and even increased energy levels. Studies also suggest that vegetarians tend to live longer lives due to their decreased risk of chronic diseases. Aside from these physical advantages, being vegetarian can also lead to reduced animal suffering since many animal based products come from factory farming operations. \n\nIn conclusion, vegetarianism is often seen as a more ethical diet compared to both carnivory and omnivory due to its positive impacts on human health, the environment, and animal welfare.", "len_ideology": 1438, "content": "\nI would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate.

With these definitions out of the way, I\u2019d like to move onto the main points of why vegetarianism is more ethical than an omnivorous or carnivorous diet.  \n\nFirst off, vegetarians generally require less land, water, and energy to produce their food compared to those who eat meat. This is because plant-based proteins typically need fewer resources to grow and harvest than animal proteins do. In addition, a vegetarian diet causes far fewer emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane which can contribute to global warming. Furthermore, a vegetarian diet has been shown to reduce the risk of certain diseases due to its high fiber content, leading to improved overall health. Lastly, a vegetarian lifestyle often encourages people to become more conscious about how they affect the environment, animals, and fellow humans.

Similarly, when I refer to veganism, I am referring to those who follow a strict plant based diet which excludes all animal products including dairy and eggs. With these definitions out of the way, I will now proceed to my arguments.  \n\nMy first point is that vegetarianism can potentially be more beneficial for overall health than an omnivorous diet. A recent study conducted at Loma Linda University found that individuals who followed a vegetarian diet had lower rates of obesity, heart disease, and certain types of cancer compared to their non-vegetarian counterparts. This suggests that a vegetarian lifestyle may provide numerous health benefits beyond just improved morality. \n\nFurthermore, many popular cultures around the world have embraced vegetarianism as a form of spiritual cleansing or purification. For example, Hindu\u2019s often practice a lacto-vegetarian diet during festivals such as Holi and Diwali as a way to honor their gods. In addition, Buddhists often refrain from consuming animal products while fasting during special holidays. Clearly, there is something to be said about the spiritual benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle. \n\nIn conclusion, vegetarianism has been shown to provide numerous physical and spiritual benefits.

Factors of early marriage: Love This is by far the most logical reason for teenagers getting married. However, when you are young and inexperienced, you might not know what love really is. You have to realize that having a crush on someone can fool you into thinking that you are in love. Typical examples that it's a crush and not love would be: wanting to get married to that someone because he/she is popular; because he's a sports hero; because she's the hottest girl in school. These are not legitimate reasons to marry a person because these qualities change. One day high school will be over and he might not be the most popular guy that you know anymore or she might not be the hottest girl that you know. You need to understand that the love that is required for marriage is unconditional love. Pregnancy Oh no, there is a baby on the way. We have to get married. This is one of the leading reasons for teenagers getting married. If your girlfriend is pregnant it's not to say that you should get married.

Marriage is not a solution to an unplanned pregnancy. -Despite declines in rates of teen pregnancy in the U.S., about 820,000 teens become pregnant each year. That means that 34 percent of teenagers have at least one pregnancy before they turn 20. -79 percent of teenagers who become pregnant are unmarried. -Utah's teen pregnancy rate is high, as well as Southern teen pregnancy but these are areas where women still get married prior to the age of 20 with some regularity (although this is changing). -80 percent of teenage pregnancies are unintended. -Nearly four in ten teenage girls whose first intercourse experience happened at 13 or 14 report that the sex was unwanted or involuntary. -The main rise in the teen pregnancy rate is among girls younger than 15* -Close to 25 percent of teen mothers have a second child within two years of the first birth.* Insecurity and a Sense of Belonging this is another significant reason for teenagers getting married so early in their lives.

Even an all-powerful deity would be unable to create a \"squared triangle\" or the \"odor of yellow\" due to the fact that words have no fixed meanings and language cannot be relied upon to make such judgments. For example, if a single word has multiple interpretations among different languages or cultures (i.e. another language), then even an almighty being couldn't please everyone at the same time. If someone were to rely exclusively on mental pictures to challenge an all-powerful entity, they might as well be speaking nonsense: \"Could an all-knowing goddess draw a'square triangle'?\" For an all-powerful deity, nothing is impossible. If anyone were able to envision a concept without utilizing language (essentially visualizing it), then we couldn't conjure up a conception that such a being would consider impracticable.

Camus argues that this is the embodiment of the Absurd man.

{"basic": "\nArgument: Firstly, let\u2019s define \u201cwelfare\u201d \u2013 according to Merriam Webster, it is \u201cthe protection of individuals from misfortune or distress\u201d. This includes economic security, healthcare, housing, education, employment services, nutritional aid, disability benefits, veterans\u2019 benefits, and more. In short, welfare provides essential support to those in need, allowing them to live with dignity and pursue their goals. Now, let\u2019s consider the opposing viewpoint \u2013 that the welfare system creates dependency and discourages people from taking personal responsibility for their lives. While this may be true in certain cases, it fails to acknowledge the positive impacts of welfare programs. For example, providing access to health care allows people to stay healthy and productive, reducing overall costs to both individuals and society as a whole. Additionally, welfare programs provide vital economic security to those most vulnerable in our societies, preventing poverty and its associated social ills such as poor educational attainment, increased crime rates, and poor mental health. Furthermore, welfare programs create jobs and stimulate local economies; cutting these programs would result in job losses and decreased spending in communities across America. Ultimately, welfare helps to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to lead successful and fulfillting lives, regardless of their circumstances.", "len_basic": 1410, "len_orig": 2939, "ideology": "\nArgument: First, thanks to Wj for proposing this very interesting topic. I am making the assumption that the debate is focused on the current US situation, but if that is not the case I will be glad to expand it to other countries in the second round. Somebody -I think it was Churchill?- once said that democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others. Something similar can be applied to the welfare state. It is full of inconsistencies, loopholes and potential for abuse, yet it beats the alternative -the lack of it. I see it in evolutionary terms: animals (other than humans I mean) use diverse combinations of cooperation and violence to reach their goals. When it comes to what to do with the destitute, the weak, the sick or the injured, their strategies vary from community help (survival) to open violence or abandon (both an effective death sentence). Humans have the cognition ability to realize there are multiple alternatives, but we don't necessarily agree on which one to use: so when we are faced with that situation, some of us choose to assist the ones in need, while some others will effectively kick the weaklings out of the group. Add to this that human power goes well beyond animal's: while animals can only assert themselves in terms of physical force, humans extend that power by long reach influence (i.e. a paunchy, feeble CEO can decide the destiny of thousands of physically stronger men). And this is when the need for a welfare state kicks in -an institution above individual power, in charge of redistributing wealth and assistance where the community alone is unable to, be it because of unwillingness or lack of power. Add to this the issue of inequality, be it gender based or racial. Women have made significant progress but are still far from effective equal rights (sometimes the laws exist, but their application leaves much to be desired). Racial minorities are in the same boat -Jim Crow laws are long gone, but a color blind society is still a pipe dream, and in many ways the palliative measures such as Affirmative Action do more to freeze a situation of practical inequality under \"tolerable\" terms than to pave the way for true equality.

Secondly, I believe that the welfare system should be reformed rather than completely abolished. While there may be certain flaws within the system, it does provide essential aid to those in need; without it, millions of people across the world would suffer greatly. For example, in the United States, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program provides vital nutrition assistance to low-income individuals and families, helping them to obtain healthy and balanced diets. Furthermore, cash assistance programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families offer crucial financial support to parents with dependent children, allowing them to meet everyday needs such as rent and utilities. Additionally, access to affordable healthcare through Medicaid has been lifesaving for countless individuals, providing them with the medical treatment they require regardless of their economic status. Therefore, although the welfare system undoubtedly has its issues, it also serves an essential purpose in providing necessary aid to those who truly need it.", "len_content": 1138, "style": "\nArgument: Firstly, thank you to Wj for suggesting this intriguing topic.

Thirdly, someone \u2013 allegedly Churchill \u2013 once stated that \u201cdemocracy is the worst system of government, apart from all the rest\u201d. This statement implies that despite its flaws, the welfare state remains preferable to any other type of regime. In my opinion, this comparison highlights how imperfect democracies can still provide better protection for those in need compared to other systems. Additionally, humans possess superior intelligence over animals which allows them to recognize the multitude of options available and make collectively agreed decisions regarding how best to distribute resources. Furthermore, human strength extends beyond animal\u2019s brute strength; whereas animals rely solely upon physical force, humans utilize both physical strength and influential power. As a result, when individuals face difficult situations, some opt to provide aid whilst others may resort to exclusion or even violence. Therefore, in order to ensure that everyone has access to basic needs, a welfare state becomes essential \u2013 an institution above individual power which allocates resources and provides support where communities fail to do so. Moreover, inequality continues to persist in many societies regardless of whether it is gender-based or race-related. Although women have achieved considerable advancements, they remain disadvantaged relative to men in many respects. Similarly, racial minorities often find themselves at a distinct disadvantage due to historical prejudice and structural bias. Thus, additional legislation and policies are required to combat entrenched discrimination and bring about real change. Finally, let us remember that every citizen of the United States receives financial aid from the government via various programs including food stamps, housing vouchers, and healthcare services.

Firstly, my opponent has already conceded that \"where the crime is committed in the heat of the moment there is no likelihood that any punishment will act as a deterrent,\" and so this point now only considers 1st degree, planned, murder. In the first instance, we consider that there simply is no real deterrent effect on committers of 1st degree murder; we believe that if they have planned their killing they are likely to be either mentally ill or martyrs (in the case of terrorists) or believe they will not be caught, and in either case the deterrent effect will have no impact whatsoever. Secondly, even if it did, we consider that the difference between the deterrent of prisons and the death penalty is minuscule. My opponent attempts to normalize prison, saying that prisoners receive three square meals and perhaps parole, but in fact, inside many prisons is rape, of which over 2000 cases in prisons were reported last year [1], and, in many of the high-security prisons 1st degree murderers would inhabit, there is no freedom of movement. In the view of many potential murderers, the death penalty would be an 'easy way out' that would be preferred to prisons, if these thoughts were considered at all.", "len_all": 2802, "text": "(I had actually requested in round 1 that: \"The format of this debate will be round one for definitions (in first Con I simply expect my opponent to respond to my definitions) and the others for argument.\" Because Con argued in this time, I ask Con to forfeit the last round that we have equal time for argumentation.) When we look at the death penalty, we see am archaically old punishment that can only be described as cruel and unusual that just doesn't fit in with modern views of the criminal justice system. I will argue that the death penalty is a cruel punishment and that it kills innocent prisoners. First, to Con's case: In Con's prompt response, for which I thank him, he laid out a set of value criteria and only one real contention; the strong deterrent the death penalty provides. Firstly, Con tries to set this debate strictly based on a utilitarian philosophy. However, he provided no evidence for this claim, and we refute it, as libertarian philosophy around whether it is ever morally correct for the state to take a life is also important in this debate. Secondly, Con raised his argument, coming in three parts: 1. The death penalty deters crime. 2. The state has a responsibility to reduce crime. 3. Crime rates rise when the death penalty is enforced.

My opponent attempts to normalise prison, saying that prisoners receive three square meals and perhaps parole, but in fact, inside many prisons is rape, of which over 2000 cases in prisons were reported last year [1], and, in many of the high-security prisons 1st degree murderers would inhabit, there is no freedom of movement. In the view of many potential murderers, the death penalty would be an 'easy way out' that would be preferred to prisons, if these thoughts were considered at all. Secondly, my opponent claims that it is empirically true that murder rates rise when the death penalty is stopped. Firstly, he has not provided any unbiased source for these statistics. Secondly, according to these statistics, the crimes that actually rose were 'fights involving fists and feet, stabbing and cutting by glass or a broken bottle, shooting and strangling. 72% of the victims were male with younger men being most at risk', exacly the sort of unplanned heat-of-the-moment crimes which he said he did not support the death penalty for. Finally, we believe that other associated causes, such as population increases and rising poverty can be better associated with rising murder rates. --------Own Case-------- Contention One: Firstly, on a principled level, we object to the death penalty, in that we say that a system of execution is basically inhumane. Firstly, we object to the very idea of this execution. The group my opponent wishes to execute are 1st degree murderers, but the state is almost lowered to their level when it commits an act of extreme violence such as killing a person. Secondly, it is inhumane in terms of the pain and suffering inflicted upon the victim and their family. The death penalty in the form I presume my opponent supports, lethal injection, is highly painful; scientists have theorised that the anaesthetic used wears off before the death of the prisoner [2]. For this reason, we argue that it is clearly inhumane. Furthermore, it causes great suffering for the accused's family; they cannot visit their family member anymore. Contention Two Secondly, some prisoners who are executed are later found to be not guilty. Even years after conviction, convicted killers can be found to be innocent as new evidence comes to light. 139 cases of this kind, where convictions have subsequently been quashed [3], and there may be others which have not been discovered.

{"basic": "\nTranscript #3 - Round 4\n\nSpeaker A: Hello again! In this round, I would like to present two new arguments against the resolution. Firstly, even if we accept that God has the power to prevent evil, it does not necessarily follow that he should always exercise that power. After all, allowing some amount of evil seems to be necessary for certain kinds of good to exist, such as the importance of human free will. Secondly, even if God did possess the power to eliminate every instance of evil, it could be argued that he simply chooses not to exert it due to his mysterious plan. Ultimately, whether or not God possesses the power to stop evil is irrelevant; the fact remains that he allows it to occur, which makes him culpable for its presence in the world.", "len_basic": 759, "len_orig": 2026, "ideology": "\nArgument: I'm back! There are many possible explanations to the \"problem of evil\":<URL>. Possibility 1: Free Will - God wanted everyone to have free will. With free will comes the will to make others suffer. Thus, God had to choose between free will and freedom from suffering, and knew that the lack of an ability to make choices was a greater pain than suffering, so free will is the explanation. Just because God already knows what you will do with your free will, doesn't mean that you don't have it. You can still jump up and down twice right now, or three times, or four, but God will have already known what you wanted to do (which I am guessing to be jumping up and down zero times). Possibility 2: Punishment - When Eve committed the first sin, God had to come up with a punishment. Thus, he came up with suffering. He doesn't want everyone to suffer, but a punishment was necessary for breaking His rules. Why does a mother put her child in a time-out, or spank him, when he does wrong, but wishes for him to never experience such things again? It is because the child needs to be taught a lesson, and in the end, the time-out will have improved his character. Christian philosopher Peter Kreeft came up with six solutions: \"A) God may use short-term evils for long-range goods. B) God created the possibility of evil, but not the evil itself, and that free will was necessary for the highest good of real love.

{"basic": "\nEffective Argument: \nHello nypuller, and thank you for accepting my challenge to debate this topic! Allow me to begin by expressing my disagreement with your premise that we should not be funding science. On the contrary, there is a clear economic benefit to both science and art. If one desires to be an artist, they should be willing to take the financial risk just like the countless entrepreneurs in our nation who must save their funds, start a business, and often go years without being cash flow positive. We all enjoy pizza, and while tomatoes may be beneficial for the brain, it is not the responsibility of the federal government to fund the arts, any more than it is responsible for financing pizza restaurants. If the art is truly in demand, then people, schools, or other organizations will purchase it. However, if what one creates does not have value, then no one will buy it. This can be determined through the free markets, rather than relying on governmental funding which would only result in wasteful spending on projects that do not have public support. In conclusion, artists and scientists alike should accept the fact that they must take risks in order to make their dreams come true - whether that be starting a business or creating a masterpiece.", "len_basic": 1273, "len_orig": 1242, "ideology": "\nEffective Argument: Hi nypuller, \nI appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. I disagree with your assertion that there isn\u2019t a place for public funding of science and art. While there may certainly be cases where individuals or private companies can provide more support than governments, there are also many instances when markets fail to adequately recognize the value of certain types of research and creation. In these situations, taxpayer dollars can help ensure that important work is supported regardless of its commercial potential. This has been true throughout history and remains so today - think of how much our understanding of physics would be lacking if governments hadn\u2019t invested heavily in basic scientific research over the past century. Similarly, while there may be individual cases of poorly conceived projects, overall public investment in the arts has had tremendous social benefits such as increasing accessibility to cultural events, promoting innovation, and providing employment opportunities. Ultimately, decisions about which projects receive funding should be made carefully and responsibly, but blanket statements against all forms of public financing ignore the significant contributions that it can make.", "len_ideology": 1256, "content": "\nEffective Argument: \nHello nypuller, and thank you for accepting my challenge to debate this topic! Allow me to begin by expressing my disagreement with your premise that we should be funding science. While there may be a perceived economic benefit to both science and art, it does not justify using taxpayer funds to support them. Just as entrepreneurs must invest their own capital into starting up a business, artists must do the same when pursuing their craft - if they believe in its value enough to dedicate their time and effort towards creating it. Furthermore, the free markets cannot always accurately assess what is or isn\u2019t \u201cin demand\u201d, which can lead to wasteful spending on projects that lack merit.

Thanks for taking up my challenge on this issue. Allow me to begin by stating that while there may be an economic market for certain types of scientific research, such as pharmaceutical or medical advancements, I believe that investment into these areas should still be heavily subsidized by our government. This is due to the fact that many scientific discoveries can benefit society at large, regardless of whether they generate immediate financial returns. Furthermore, if left entirely to the free markets, only those projects which are deemed profitable would receive funding - leaving potentially valuable knowledge unexplored and unrealised. In addition, public funds could also help to bridge the gap between private sector innovation and its eventual commercialisation, thus allowing more citizens access to new technologies sooner rather than later.

Allow me to begin by stating that while there may be an economic market for certain types of art, scientific research has been proven to benefit society at large and therefore should be supported by tax dollars. Think about it - if someone wanted to become an artist, they would need to invest their own resources into their craft, just like any entrepreneur does when starting a business. But what happens if their work doesn\u2019t gain traction or isn\u2019t appreciated? They could potentially lose a lot of money. This is where the government can step in and help support these endeavors since they provide such valuable social benefits. Furthermore, allowing individuals to pursue their passions freely allows them to develop new skills which can ultimately strengthen our economy. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to fund particular projects should be left to experts within those fields so that only quality works get the necessary funds. To conclude, public financing of artistic projects helps foster innovation and growth, and should thus be encouraged.", "len_ideology-style": 1137, "all": "\nArgument (Liberal): Hello nypuller! Thank you for taking up this debate on public funding for science and art. It\u2019s true that there is an economic market for both science and art; however, not everyone has access to these markets or can afford them. Public funding allows more people to participate in those fields regardless of their socioeconomic status. Furthermore, if we do not invest in research and development now, our society may suffer due to lack of innovation. As for the idea that taxpayer dollars should not be used to support certain projects, I would argue that it is important to use public funds to support areas where there is potential for great social impact. In addition, when the government invests in scientific research and artistic creation, they generate economic growth which ultimately benefits everybody. Therefore, I believe that public funding for science and art is necessary for a healthy and prosperous society.", "len_all": 947, "text": "Hello nypuller, and thanks for accepting my challenge to debate this topic.

The problem with government funding, is that all of the garbage gets the same type of funding as the good stuff. The only means to determine art-in-demand, is to let the free-markets decide.

With regards to the specific issue you mentioned, child marriage in the Mormon faith, I believe that it is important to look at the context surrounding the practice. While it is certainly concerning that minors are allowed to enter into legally binding contracts, it is also worth taking into account the culture and values behind the practice. From what I have read, Mormons view these marriages as a way to strengthen family bonds and create stable households, rather than simply entering into sexual relationships.

I want share the following from https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/religious_exemption ---------------------------- Religion has long played a role in debates over parental rights and responsibilities. Courts often recognize a parent's right to raise his or her children according to their religious beliefs, including the right to refuse medical treatments based upon those beliefs. But what happens when a parent's religious beliefs conflict with society's general moral standards? When does a parent's right to exercise their religious beliefs trump society's interest in protecting its children from potential harm? This issue was recently highlighted in a controversial case involving members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS). In this case, the State of Texas sought to intervene after learning that some members of the church had practiced polygamy and underage marriage. Ultimately, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling that the State had violated the First Amendment by prosecuting the parents involved in the underage marriages. While the majority opinion acknowledged the importance of both the parents' right to freely exercise their religion and the state's interest in protecting children from potential harm, the court ultimately concluded that the parents' right to practice their religion was paramount.", "len_style": 1883, "ideology-content": "\nArgument: I absolutely agree in almost all cases, most especially one that lays the label of 'child abuser' on any parent, that each case should be handled with personalization for each case.

We are repulsed at the thought of someone forcing her religious views on us or others. \"We want the option of believing and behaving as we wish--particularly on matters as significant as our religious beliefs. Although important, these rights are not unlimited. If a person's religious expression harms another, it can be legitimately restricted. Human slavery and sacrifice, for example, are impermissible even if prescribed by one's religion. Likewise for religious beliefs or practices which might harm one's children. For instance, the courts have consistently held that a parental decision to withhold necessary medical treatment from a child harms that child's interest (Wallace v. Labrenz 104 NE 2nd 769). In these situations the state may legitimately require necessary medical care even if the parent's sincere religious conviction forbids it. The courts, however, have been reluctant to interfere with parental decisions except when the child's life or physical health is threatened. Though this reluctance is in many ways understandable, it is unjustified. Children's interests should have more weight than most courts presently grant them. Or so it seems to me. The crucial (though heretofore ignored) question is: can the parents legitimately demand that the children be shielded from beliefs to which they (the parents) object? Does the fact that the children purport to agree with the parents have any legal weight? The parents claim the constitution gives them the right to have their children opt out of reading these \"offensive\" books and to be exposed only to texts which express views identical with their own. Are the parents right? Before I address these questions, let me quickly review the facts of the case: the parents challenged the use of certain readers in elementary reading class. The readers in question depict children who question parental authority, discuss situation ethics, consider the tenability of divergent religious beliefs, and advocate tolerance of opposing views--views to which the parents of the children strenuously object. Claims akin to these have been previously recognized by other courts. For example, in Moody v. Cronin (484 F. Supp. 270) children were exempt from physical education classes because their parents thought exposure to students dressed in shorts would incite unwholesome urges. In Wisconsin v. Yoder (406 U.S. 205), Amish children were exempt from high school since their attendance would presumably undermine the Amish way of life advocated by their parents. However, even in these cases where the courts have ruled against parental claims (as in Mozert), they did not justify the decisions by express appeal to the interest of children. In most cases, they did not even mention the children's interests. Instead they cited some \"compelling state interest\" which presumably justified overriding the parental claims. Nonetheless, I think we can discern a deep and pervasive confusion about the scope of parental right and the children's interests. \"\" I am absolutely FOR freedom of religion, but there are many instances, without directly quoting or citing them, that have proven extremely harmful, such as child marriages in the Mormon faith.

Yoder (406 U.S. 205), Amish children were exempt from high school since their attendance would presumably undermine the Amish way of life advocated by their parents.  \n  \r\nHowever, even in these cases where the courts have ruled against parental claims (as in Mozert), they did not justify the decisions by express appeal to the interest of children. In most cases, they did not even mention the children's interests. Instead they cited some \"compelling state interest\" which presumably justified overriding the parental claims. Nonetheless, I think we can discern a deep and pervasive confusion about the scope of parental right and the children's interests. \"\"  \n  \r\nI am absolutely FOR freedom of religion, but there are many instances, without directly quoting or citing them, that have proven extremely harmful, such as child marriages in the Mormon faith.

However, this only works if the woman is careful enough not to leave any evidence behind which she could get caught. Furthermore, even if she manages to pull off adding her own sperms to somebody else\u2019s food without getting noticed, does that make it morally acceptable? The answer is still no. Additionally, he also mentioned that sperm is nicer and tastier compared to saliva which is true. However, again, this does not justify the act of adding another person\u2019s bodily fluid to their food. Moreover, if we were to apply this logic, why stop at sperm? Why not ejaculate into the food too? After all, it might give the recipient a special \u201ckick\u201d that regular saliva wouldn\u2019t provide.

Everything\u2019s pretty jumbled up so I\u2019ll do a line by line bear with me I have low character limits. My opponent says he himself is a Home Depot Associate and he knows their number one concern is customer satisfaction. Then he talks about lowering prices, and how they care for the children.

Then he talks about \u201cFirst\u201d and the F stands for find. So workers go around asking customers for help. Lets look at this review from a customer at Lowes (Since I have low character space I will just post the link): https://www.lowes.com/cd_CustomerServiceReviews?review=true&storeId=30546 Here you can see a customer talking about how he gets pissed at workers constantly finding him and asking for help. Lowes can now IMPROVE on this. Home Depot, however, believes First is always effective when it obviously isn\u2019t and they don\u2019t know because they don\u2019t have a customer review site.

Lets look at this review from a customer at Lowes (Since I have low character space I will just post the link) <URL>... From the same website he talks about how he gets pissed at workers constantly finding him and asking for help. Lowes can now IMPROVE on this. Home Depot, however, believes First is always effective when it obviously isn't and they don't know because they don't have a customer review site. Now he talks about all these specials Home Depot has over Lowes one is the Military Discount. Lowes ALSO has this [1]. Since my opponent didn't know this he obviously doesn't know about Lowes discounts. Lowes is superior for their TRUE interest in customers.", "label": 0, "author": "Guitar_Guru", "original_text": "\n  \r\nFirst I would like to establish the Burden of Proof in this round.  \n  \r\nThe Pro must prove that Home Depot is better than Lowes.  \n  \r\nThe Con must prove either Lowes is better than Home Depot or that the two stores are about equal.  \n  \r\nNow that the B.O.P is established I will now establish how we should decide the effectiveness of a Home Improvement Store. I contend that in order for a store to be considered good then they must be able to consider the customers in all situations. So basically a good store can consider the customers all the time.  \n  \r\nI will now move on to my case:  \n  \r\nPoint 1: Lowes cares about their customers enough to put up a website where customers can place complaints or reviews about the customer satisfaction.  \n  \r\nLowes has this website here   http://lowes.pissedconsumer.com...   where customers are able to voice their opinions about how Lowes is. You may find many poor reviews but at least Lowes recognizes they need improvement and are willing to post up a website to see where they need to improve. I have found no such site for Home Depot except for this site here   http://reviews.homedepot.com...   but there are no customer service reviews section which means Home Depot assumes that it is already doing a sufficient job when it may not be. This is how Lowes is better at considering the customers than Home Depot.  \n  \r\nNow on to my opponents case.  \n  \r\nEverything's pretty jumbled up so I'll do a line by line bear with me I have low character limits.  \n  \r\nMy opponent says he himself is a Home Depot Associate and he knows their number one concern is customer satisfaction. Then he talks about lowering prices, and how they care for the children. Then he talks about workers going into training and the workers actually work together. So:  \n  \r\n1) He provides no empiric evidence or statistics, he has NO sources. We can't just take his word for things we don't know if workers truly work together or if they truly lower prices or if they do care for the children.  \n  \r\n2) If Home Depots concern truly is customer satisfaction then why don't they have a website or some evident system where I can truly say I was satisfied with Home Depot or not ?  \n  \r\nThen he talks about \"First\" and the F stands for find. So workers go around asking customers for help.
