As a policy debater, it is my tendency to refer to my opponents in the third person, as if I'm addressing a judge. If this bothers you, I will do my best to try and stop in future rounds. I will be arguing from three lines of reasoning. First, that America is still the leading beacon of hope and freedom for the rest of the world, and therefore no other country better deserves the title of the \"land of freedom\". Second, that America's Constitution, what outlines and confines the U.S. government, is based off the objective of freedom for all, and therefore freedom is still the heart of America. Lastly, I will be arguing that the freedom of America isn't from the government, but from the people. So long as the people desire freedom, America will be the home of the free.

Contention 1. Environment Via the debate topic we can assume that the US federal government will be making solar roads, but you might just ask yourself \"What are these solar panels made from?\" Well I have the answer, Jelly Fish proteins. The reason for this is that Jelly fish proteins are the cheapest and easiest to use when making solar panels since they absorb light. ( <URL>... and <URL>... ) These are also known as solar cells and it has been proved that solar highways use these solar cells and according to one of the Co-inventor of solar road ways, Scott Brusaw, he has stated that these highways will need 3 layers of the solar celled panels. ( <URL>... ) Now you must be asking yourself why is this important? Well it is on the matter of fact that the over fishing of jelly fish will lead to the collapse of the fishing industry and not just in the US, but in Japan as well. Due to already over fishing the jellyfish population has increased 6 fold since the year 2002! ( <URL>... ) This has resulted in the loss of jobs, industry revenue loss, decline in fish prices (which is what can kill the fishing industry), and putting beach goers and fishermen lives in danger. ( <URL>... ) So you can see here that not only does it hurt the environment, but it comes around to hurting the economy and the average Joe. Also to remove existing roads it will be deadly to the atmosphere! Solar panels use NF3 which warms the atmosphere 17000 more times than CO2! ( <URL>... ) So may I ask what environment positive affects does this actually have?! They are also ineffeciate at collecting energy which they only collect 14% of what they receive ( <URL>... ) Contention 2. Economy (this is adding to what has been added from the last contention) According to Investors Business Daily they have reported, \" Three years ago, when Obama's Department of Energy started approving roughly $16 billion in federal loan guarantees for solar energy companies, the DOE agreed to put taxpayers' money behind startups that were working on ways to make solar panels cheaper. Two, Solyndra and Abound, have now gone belly-up .\" ( <URL>... ) We can already see that the federal government has tried their hands at solar roads and green energy, but they have failed! Here is another bomb shell. Brusaw, the co-inventor of solar roads, have stated that it would cost $5,000 per square foot of road and that there it might fail. ( <URL>... ) When the founder states that it might fail and it's going to be costly then it seems like a waste of money and a major strain on the economy that is just now getting out of a recession and starting to recover . Investors have already estimated face loss of billions if this plan goes into effect ( <URL>... ) No onto my opponent's arguments (except for the two arguments that I've already attack in my contentions) Contention 3. Safety My opponent brings up that they are safe, but lets think about one things everyone hates, pot holes! According to Discovery current solar panels are not durable and creating ones that are would sky rocket their prices and the up keep would send profits into the tubes! ( <URL>... ) Another thing that my opponent has failed to factor in is glare! Yes, glare. We have solar panels so with the light shinning on the panels we will see that the number of accidents will increase due to glare. ( <URL>... )", "label": 0, "id": 1}

PRO's R2 is not different from R1, as both are based on the same claim of \"I'm always right\", but R2 is still not providing any evidence of this claim. \"I (im_always_right) will lose this debate\" should be changed to \"I (im_always_right) will lose this debate by default if I don't prove anything to prove that I will win it\". This is the resolution that PRO is claiming, and this is the resolution that I will vote for, as it makes more sense.

My opponent takes the liberty of assuming that the matter of winning or losing will be determined by the amount of votes we each accumulate (this is seen in the first argument), and since I don't disagree, that will be the definition for the round - whoever gets more votes \"wins\", has \"won\", and is the \"winner\", and whoever gets less votes \"loses\", has \"lost\", and is the \"loser\". There are more derivations on both of those words, but I'm not going to include every single one of them. I'll take the liberty of assuming that everyone will know a derivation of \"win\" or \"lose\" when they see one. With that definition down, let's go back and examine what the resolution really means. \"I (im_always_right) will lose this debate\" >>> This means that my opponent has made a premonition for the outcome of this debate, outcome being that she will be the one that ends up with the lesser amount of votes. PRO's case says three things... 1) If she wins this debate by getting more votes, then she loses. 2) If she forfeits, she loses the debate. 3) [[[[[If her arguments suck, then she loses] < that means she wins ] < that means she loses] < that means she wins, because of the resolution] < that means she loses ] ...and everything in it is nontopical. We are NOT looking at whether the prediction TURNS OUT to be right or wrong in this debate (as that would be out of our power, we can't see into the future), NOR are we looking at the final accumulation of the debate's votes (as that would be impossible as well, not only because we can't see into the future but also because the voting on this site doesn't end), but rather, examining the truth of what PRO's position, or rather, the resolution, is claiming. This claim is a prediction, a prediction that PRO will lose. However, PRO's R1 does not argue nor give us evidence on why such a prediction would be true. The only things we see are conditions for after the debate has ended, and those don't pertain to what the resolution is claiming at all. Until PRO has shown us some evidence of such a premonition, perhaps a screenshot from the future, we cannot believe her due to burden of proof. Think of the resolution as a claim, such as \"Invisible pink unicorns exist\". If the instigator has made such a claim and fails to show as such, then you automatically vote for the contender, as the contender doesn't need to prove anything at all. That said you default vote CON at this point since PRO has given us no evidence to believe her position (and consequently, the resolution) of this prediction of the future as true.", "label": 0, "id": 6}
