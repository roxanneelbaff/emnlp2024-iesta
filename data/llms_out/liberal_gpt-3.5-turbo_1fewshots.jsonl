While it is true that exposure to pornography and engaging in sexual activities can influence one's sexual desires, it is essential to approach these topics with nuance and understanding. Lust, like any other addiction, can be a complex issue, and it is not fair to solely attribute negative behaviors such as running wild, sleeping around, cheating, or even rape to lust alone. These actions are the result of a combination of factors, including personal choices, upbringing, and societal influences.\n\nRegarding sex education, it is important to recognize that parents play a vital role in educating their children about sex. However, it is unrealistic to expect that all parents will fulfill this responsibility adequately. In cases where parents are unable or unwilling to provide comprehensive sex education, it is crucial for schools to step in and provide accurate and age-appropriate information.

It is not fair to prioritize one nation over another based on population or any other factor.

However, it is important to consider the expectations that the international community has developed regarding our aid efforts.\n\nIn terms of Africa, I believe that our presence there may lead to more violence and instability. The tyrants in power do not care about the well-being of their people, and our attempts to promote positive change in the past have not been successful. Additionally, our current focus on terrorism and the involvement in multiple wars leaves little room for prioritizing the well-being of other nations. Foreign aid is not a fixed concept and can be adjusted to meet the needs of different regions.

As a realist, I believe there should be a limit to how much we help other nations. If a nation demonstrates a commitment to peace and good governance, I would gladly support them.

Firstly, I appreciate the effort you have put into your research and the well-planned ideas you have presented. However, I must admit that I have not conducted any personal research on this topic prior to this debate. My arguments are based solely on my own thoughts and opinions. While I do not aim to win this debate, I do hope to broaden my perspective by considering a different viewpoint. It is important to hear both sides of an issue in order to fully understand it, a practice that is often neglected in today's society. I acknowledge that I hold biased views and I believe that biases are necessary to keep debates engaging. That being said, I approach debates with a critical mindset and tend to question the credibility of specific facts presented by individuals. I simply do not have the time or inclination to extensively fact-check information found on the internet. I want to clarify that I am not indifferent to the suffering of others and I do care about those in need. However, as Americans, we often provide aid to other nations while overlooking the problems that exist within our own inner cities. It is impossible to help everyone, and I question why Africa should receive more aid than countries like Indonesia. Is it fair to prioritize aid based on population size? After all, it is not Indonesia's fault that they have a smaller population and yet suffer in similar ways. It is important to remember that our government does not benefit financially from this project; the only reward is the satisfaction of helping others. While I would love to assist those in need, the truth is that it is costly and the international community has come to expect aid from us. Unfortunately, many of our good deeds go unappreciated because other nations resent what we have: freedom, wealth, and prosperity. Personally, I believe that Africa is a volatile region with potential for more violence and death. Our mere presence angers the tyrants in power, who do not care about the well-being of their people. This is why previous attempts to promote positive change in Africa have been unsuccessful. Additionally, I would like to address the state of American foreign policy. Currently, our focus is primarily on terrorism, and the well-being of others is not a top priority. Our resources and attention are directed towards our own citizens, as they should be and have not been in the past. We are already involved in two wars and potentially on the brink of another. Nuclear war poses a greater threat than access to clean water in Africa. Furthermore, foreign aid is not a fixed concept and can be adjusted to meet specific needs. I am confident that we already provide a significant amount of aid to Africa, and a $190 million increase is substantial. All of these factors should be taken into consideration when evaluating the feasibility of this project. While it would be admirable to help those suffering in Africa, we must also consider the costs, both present and future. As a realist, I believe there needs to be a limit to how much we assist other nations. I am more than willing to support nations that prioritize peace over power-hungry dictatorships. However, until a government in Africa emerges from a civil war with a commitment to reform, there is little hope for the success of a water project. I apologize for not presenting my points in a structured manner. When voting on this issue, I encourage you to consider your own opinion and the side that has presented the most logical arguments. I want to emphasize that I have never been part of a debate team and I simply enjoy expressing my opinions and hearing others'. It is important to remember that the more America does to help foreign nations, the less we are able to address pressing domestic issues. There are numerous problems within our own country that require urgent attention. As Americans, it is our responsibility to prioritize the well-being of our own people above all else.

Now, nearly half of my annual income is allocated to the Government, who then utilize it on my behalf, a situation that does not entirely please me. Frankly, I would prefer to retain that money for personal use, perhaps investing in a luxurious car, a helicopter, and a charming cottage in the south of France. I might also consider making a modest donation to charity to alleviate my conscience, although I am not entirely committed to that idea. The reality is, however, that most individuals share a similar mindset. Only a small fraction of lottery winners generously contribute their fortunes to noble causes, and the majority of high-earning individuals strive to minimize their tax obligations. This is precisely why individuals are not granted the freedom to allocate their funds as they see fit. For instance, I might object to funding the education of other people's children when I have none of my own, and instead propose that my taxes be directed towards employing police marksmen to address the issue of inconsiderate motorists who hog the overtaking lanes on motorways. Yet, in doing so, I would be neglecting the fact that I was born into a desperately impoverished family and received an education at the expense of taxpayers. Furthermore, I must consider that one day I will grow old and may rely on the state for my pension and healthcare needs, and that a well-educated workforce will be necessary to sustain these requirements. The truth is, in general, individuals are not equipped to make decisions that are in their long-term best interests, which is precisely why we elect politicians to make such decisions on our behalf.

In free societies, advertisers freely market their products, so there is no unfair influence.\n\nAs for P3, I'm unsure what my opponent means by \"information violence.\" If it refers to advertising making people act against their own interests, that is simply untrue.
