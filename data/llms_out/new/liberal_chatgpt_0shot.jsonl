However, until a civil war brings about a government in Africa that is conducive to reform and the success of this water project, there is little hope for meaningful change. I apologize for not presenting my arguments in a structured manner. When voting on this issue, I encourage you to consider your own opinion and the side that presents the most logical viewpoints.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that I have never been part of any debate team and I simply enjoy expressing and hearing different opinions. It is crucial to remember that the more America does to assist foreign lands, the less attention is given to pressing domestic issues. As Americans, it is our responsibility to prioritize the well-being of our own people. Our resources, innovative ideas, and determination for change should be directed towards addressing the challenges within our own nation, rather than focusing on Africa.\"", "len_ideology": 3982, "text": "I will keep this short and to the point. First, you have done a good job as well and it seems to me that you may have written a paper on this issue. You have a ton of sources as well as other well planned ideas. However, I have not had any personal research or knowledge that hasn't been produced from my own brain prior to this debate. I have come up with all my arguments on a whim. I feel this has merit. I am not out to win this debate, actually I am out to simply broaden my horizon from a different view point. The only way to fully understand an issue is to hear both sides, which many people do not do these days. I hate the UN and do hold bias views. We all do and without them it makes a debate dry. With that being said if you access this debate in the \"proper\" context of a debate, you win. But logic isn't robotic and I lean away from many specifically cited facts in debates because I judge the merit of the person writing the facts before I can really believe what they are saying. I simply do not have the time or will to scrutinize the internet for these. Hope that kind of makes sense. I am not a heartless individual and I do care about people that are suffering. But, as Americans we do give a lot of aid to other nations sometime overlooking the problems that plague the inner cities of our nation. We can not help everybody and why does Africa deserve it more than say children in Indonesia? If it is because of population isn't that bias in the sense that it isn't Indonesia's fault they are small because they are suffering in the same ways. Again you must remember the benefits our government would not make from this project other than a warm feeling of helping others. I would love to help others, but the truth is that it is expensive and the international community has come to expect it from us. Much of our good deeds go upraised because many nations hate what we have: freedom, wealth, and prosperity. I feel that Africa is bad news waiting to happen. Looking at the big picture I feel like just being over there is a stepping stone to more violence and death. Our presence alone angers the tyrants. I know you talked about the people dying so there is nobody to rule. These tyrants do not care about these people. They are selfish, heartless individuals. This is why there hasn't been any success with anything good we have tried to promote there in the past. Furthermore, I would like to talk about the state of American foreign policy. All we have now is terrorism on our minds. Caring about the well being of others is that last thing on our mind. Our money and energy is focused on Americans, where it should be and hasn't been in the past. We are involved in two Wars and possibly on the verge of another. Nuclear war is more pressing than water to Africa. Foreign Aid isn't fixed either. It can be changed to suit the needs. I bet we already send a substantial amount to Africa and 190 million is a pretty large increase. Take this all in to account when you think of this project. Sure it would be nice to help these suffering people, but remember the costs of not just now but in the future. I am a realist and the line needs to be drawn about helping other nations. If a nation would like to practice peace instead of ruthless, power hungry dictatorships, I will gladly support them. Until a civil war claims a government like this in Africa there is no hope for Reform that would aid the creation of this water project. I apologize that I haven't laid a nice ground work point by point. When voting on this issue vote with your opinion or what side gave the most logical view points. I would like to note that I never was on any debate team of any kind and I just enjoy hearing and voicing my opinion. Just remember that the more America does to help other people in foreign lands there is less being done at home. There are many domestic issues that are in dire need of our attention. And as Americans it is our job to take care of our own people first and foremost. Our money, passionate ingenuity, and determination for change should be spearheaded into the heart of America.
