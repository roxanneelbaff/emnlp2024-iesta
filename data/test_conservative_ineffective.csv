"True, Kids are the future, but the fact that the earth is over populated can be the down fall of our species. More kids means more mouths to feed, more pollution more crime,. etc etc. Maybe the child will be something great, or maube he'll be the next Dahmer or rapist, ya never know, but dealing with the worst of out comes, comes from scared future parents. If they simply can't handle a kid because of finances, or dealing with the care for a child, or the thought of the rapped victims father with gain custody, just is too much. This is why i say women should have a choice on how they want to deal with thier body. If you wanted to piece your belly or tongue, wouldn't you say that it's your choice. Or what if God placed a baby in some young womens body and has no idea why it's there, and can't afford a child at the point of her life where she's near success, shouldn't she be able to afford it?

"Take the phone application Instagram for example. Instagram is a social media application that allows people to share their photos freely with people from across the globe. Something new on social media that texting and email can never accomplish. The main plus point of social media is that it is able to reach out to a large group of people across the world in a short period of time. Instagram allows people to connect with their peers who share similar interests, allowing us to expand our horizons. To address the point on advertisements, advertisements are not always bad. Just like how we have advertisements during commercial breaks on the television, advertisements on social media platforms do not actually bring harm to us. Instead, they can actually bring more convenience into our lives when we manage to find something that we need from online advertisements. Together with the fact that many online advertisements are based on complex online algorithms to assign advertisements based on our search queries, we may very well find what we are looking for through these advertisements. Rather than blaming social media, it is our own resolve and our own choice whether or not to succumb to the influence of advertisements.",0,AmandaBaey,"

"I would like to thank Ron-Paul for this interesting debate. However, there are several flaws in his arguments that will collapse it. These flaws come from both logical and factual flaws. I do not dispute Con's points about the date of the Flood. Amount of water: I dispute, however, his calculations about the amount of water. This is simply because of the well known phenomena of catastrophic events increasing the rate of change (On which my sources touched upon. It seems that Con has ignored this). In this case, Con's argument is factually flawed . This means that Con has not factored into account the catastrophic effects of a global flood before refuting it. This also means that Con's argument is logically flawed . In conclusion, Con's argument is both factually and logically flawed . Thus I need not reply to his rhetorical question. Human Race: My opponent's argument here hinges on the assumption that Noah was a Jew. I have shown this assumption false very clearly. He is merely repeating a defeated argument. Thus this argument is logically invalid . It is also factually flawed . Why? As my opponent has brought in some new information in the last round, I feel it morally justified to bring in information of my own. The whole idea of human race is biologically unsound. To quote from [1], ""Any two unrelated human beings differ by about 3 million distinct DNA variants."" ""...the largest amount of that variation, about 85%, is among individuals within local national or linguistic populations , within the French, within the Kikuyu, within the Japanese."" ""...Of the remaining 15% of human variation, between a quarter and a half is between local populations within classically defined human ""races,"" between the French and the Ukrainians, between the Kikuyu and the Ewe, between the Japanese and the Koreans. The remaining variation, about 6% to 10% of the total human variation is between the classically defined geographical races that we think of in an everyday sense as identified by skin color, hair form, and nose shape. This imprecision in assigning the proportion of variation assigned to differences among population within ""races"" as compared to variation among ""races,"" arises precisely because there is no objective way to assign the various human populations to clear-cut races..."" (Emphasis all mine) It can be clearly seen from these quotes alone, not even by reading the article, which all should do, that the idea of race is unsound. Con considers that human of the past are incapable of travel . This is simply not true. All of Con's argument relating to this crumbles in the face of the vast evidence I have presented. Saltwater fish : Con's arguments rely on the reader not being aware of outside facts. This argument basically ignores the fact that large aquariums have freshwater and saltwater fishes living in the same tank. It is one of their major attractions. Thus this argument is factually flawed . I will not address the issue of evolution being too slow. Why did I not reply to many of Con's arguments? There is one simple answer to this. Con did not make an argument more than formulate a skeptical questionnaire . I do not respond to such types of non-arguments . Geology : My opponent has committed the grave offence of ignoring the argument . Quite simply, I have already explained this phenomenon in detail. So much so that I ran out of space. It is bad debating to ignore an argument. After all, debating is all about responding to an argument. Rebuttals that make no sense : Con's rebuttals relies on quotations from wordpress blogs. This means that he is not quoting from the scientists themselves. Basically, he relies on a source which quotes Faux, not Faux's own words. Furthermore, Con has once again ignored the evidence I presented, preferring that readers ignore it with him. I will not cite the vast evidence for my case again. Con has basically used a source ([13]) as his argument. If he wants to make an argument, he'd better write it out. Mt. Everest fossils : Like Con said, read my debate with Roy. Along with the comments. In Conclusion : Con has made the following errors: 1. Con has ignored the argument . 2. Con has made both factual and logical errors . 3. Con has used a source as an argument . 4. Con uses blog news as sources . This means that his sources is unreliable and should be discarded despite being more numerous.

"1)My opponent continues to bring up the fact that the electoral college help equalize power between the small and large state. He has been mentioning the population of Wyoming (540,000) and the smaller states that they deserve to have their voice heard. With the population of the U.S. territories being greater than 4,000,000. If I agree with his 30% republican, 30% democratic and the other 40% are the deciding factor. This is still almost twice as many so called ""Voters That Matter"" compared to the entire population of Wyoming. 2)Again with the Florida recount. The recount was originally called because Al gore had the popular vote but lost in Electoral Vote. Therefore there was a clash because the votes cast by the electors clashed with the tallied popular vote. 3)My opponent brings up that minorities have more power on a national level with the Electoral College. But, again because of the winner take all system the idea of a third party swaying or changing the outcome in a current election is unheard of. Also with the idea that minorities have more power on a nation level is crazy because as stated in the resolution"" Direct popular vote."" This is essentially says without participation of the states. This lets no one's voice go unheard but again, because of the current winner take all system there is no way for say a democrat in Texas to get there voice heard. 4)That point that I am trying to bring across is that because the number of electorates is based on census count that it doesn't matter how many votes are cast that state is still worth the same amount of electoral votes. So let's say only 1 person votes in California so then all of the electoral votes are given to the chosen party but then 2,500,000 people in Utah vote those 2,500,000 votes are only worth 6 electoral votes of course this is a great hyperbole. The New York, Florida comparison is only to more factually represent this scenario. Even though a smaller state Florida in this case had 800,000 more votes than New York but, it is still worth less in the electoral college because of the fact that the number of electors in based on census not the amount of votes In order for there to be equality for U.S. citizen's direct popular vote is easily the better choice compared to the Electoral College, because of 1. Territories have no representation in congress so they have no say in presidential elections even though they are directly affected. 2. The Electoral College has out lived its usefulness 3. Direct popular vote Strengthens the ideas of democracy by eliminating the regional advantage, and increasing voter turnout. Regional advantage is eliminated because in a direct popular vote each vote goes to candidate of choice instead of being tossed aside, in a Direct Popular Vote every vote counts so the populace would be more likely to vote because, their voice will be heard regardless of their states political allegiance. 4.

"Sunglasses I am guessing (by his use of the word 'cool') that Imabench is one of those teenage rebelling punks that you always catch doing mean things on the street. The truth is that Imabench (What a silly name!) would consider an animal 'cool' if it was a 'footy fanatic' or could do something really neat with its belly button. All of these things are simply novelty, so to only save cool animals seems really stupid to an intellectual such as myself. How to not have a brain Everyone knows that animals are dead stupid, (In fact, I'd be an advocate of renaming them 'dumbimals') and I'll list a few examples in case hesabench decides to daringly disagree. 1. Crazy Kickin' Cats - Cats just want to see us normal living things die. Also, cats are fat. 2. Horrible Horses - Horses are dead dumb because they've never done any good things. A horse has never won a gold medal at the o-lympics, a horse has never discovered radiation left over from the big bang, and not a single horse has ever won the WWE Championship [1]. 3. Bickering Birds - Birds are really not good because the only thing they're good at is singing, and I have never ever seen an album from a bird in the super shop. Malicious Money Everyone knows that money is the best thing ever. People also know that the endangered species act will cost some serious spondulix (But I bet you won't catch a frog that knows that!).

  Sunglasses  I am guessing (by his use of the word 'cool') that Imabench is one of those teenage rebelling punks that you always catch doing mean things on the street. The truth is that Imabench (What a silly name!) would consider an animal 'cool' if it was a 'footy fanatic' or could do something really neat with its belly button. All of these things are simply novelty, so to only save cool animals seems really stupid to an intellectual such as myself.  How to not have a brain  Everyone knows that animals are dead stupid, (In fact, I'd be an advocate of renaming them 'dumbimals') and I'll list a few examples in case hesabench decides to daringly disagree.  1. Crazy Kickin' Cats - Cats just want to see us normal living things die. Also, cats are fat.  2. Horrible Horses - Horses are dead dumb because they've never done any good things. A horse has never won a gold medal at the o-lympics, a horse has never discovered radiation left over from the big bang, and not a single horse has ever won the WWE Championship [1].  3. Bickering Birds - Birds are really not good because the only thing they're good at is singing, and I have never ever seen an album from a bird in the super shop.  Malicious Money   Everyone knows that money is the best thing ever. People also know that the endangered species act will cost some serious spondulix (But I bet you won't catch a frog that knows that!).

"Coal isn't the biggest source of pollution if there are a billion cars on the road emitting hazardous gases. As I stated before, coal makes up forty to fifty percent of our energy source, if we invest into cleaning coal it can be a major global discovery. America has an abundant source of coal and it's saving the tax payers millions of dollars by using it. So why should we switch to an alternative if we have other major sources of pollution that need to be tended to? Switching from oil to a natural gas would be a greater impact than changing from coal to natural gas. Especially if we can introduce a technique that can change the world. Coal has been the nation's staple of energy since it's discovery. If we don't use coal for energy, what alternative options do we have? As I state before our alternative energy sources are ineffective and expensive. We can simply use techniques like the one used by Ohio State University to make coal less ""harmful"" to the environment. This would save everyone the pain of transitioning and funding another energy source. In addition, if cars are the biggest source of pollution we should ban the use of oil rather than coal by this logic. We shouldn't ban the use of coal in energy production.",0,Roger1,"

"1) As a Politician There is a big distinction between experience and being a good politician. Obama is a good politician because he understands how to run a campaign, make political alliances etc. Huckabee lacks these skills as we saw in Iowa. His campaign did nearly all it could do to fumble away the Iowa win just days before the vote. Huckabee swore not to make a negative ad, then, showed the press the ad he would have run if he were running negative ads....which he isn't...somehow. This shows his lack of political skill, not just his inexperience. New Hampshire proves that the only reason Huckabee was able to win Iowa is due to its overwhelmingly religious populous in comparison to NH. He finished in a distant third, even with his Iowa momentum. McCain and Clinton, perhaps the two MOST ""washington"" of the bunch, just won NH. Obviously people don't mind good politicians with experience. The assumption that all politicians have lobbyists, or that all lobbyists are bad is a misconception that your whole argument is premised around. There are good practical purposes for lobbyists as well. The point remains that a good politician is going to be needed in order to win the presidency. Huckabee isn't one. He runs an awkward campaign which relies on trendy references and religious appeals. If he wasn't as funny and personable as he is, he wouldn't even be being considered as a candidate because of his weak political skills. This is obviously not just because of his experience, and is not a good thing. Obama is very politically savvy, yet unexperienced and has a non-D.C. reputation, but still is viable in both states and seen as a very electable candidate. Huckabee retains no political skills, regardless of experience. The two are very different. 2) Position Obviously all republicans are going to have most issues and stances in common. However, Huckabee has no unique or original stances or views on any major issues. He does not literally have NO PLAN, just no original or unique one. All candidates talk about being energy diversified and independent despite common conception. My principle point here is that Huckabee is not a policy thinker. He gets beat up in the debates and on talk shows on the issues other than religious or moral ones. This is obvious. The Bhutto example was just one. Huckabee is becoming famous for slipping his way out of speaking on policy issues by shifting the focus onto moral anecdotes or trendy jokes. Here he is getting beat up on meet the press: <URL>... Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision: <URL>... There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a ""christian leader"" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has. I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows. 3) Personability Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES. In any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM. Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different). Huckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem. Thats all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run. What have you said that proves me otherwise?",0,wingnut2280,"

Here he is getting beat up on meet the press:  
  http://youtube.com...  
  
Here he is caught fumbling through another policy decision:  
  http://youtube.com...  
  
There are dozens of times where Huckabee proves that he flat out does not have the policy chops to win the presidency. Why do you think all of his ads are about how much of a ""christian leader"" he is? He has played the relgion card enough in Iowa, and it worked. Now we see NH, a less religious state, realizing the lack of political knowledge and skill Huckabee has.  
  
I did not mean to imply that he had NO positions. I was simply pointing out that Huckabee is one of the weakest candidates on the issues devoid of morals and religion. His policy merit is weak and it shows.  
  
3) Personability  
  
Maybe we misunderstand each other on this point. I'm not talking about public speaker in the sense that one has confidence and can clearly articulate. All politicians can do this. Huckabee, however, can not seem to makes his points clearly, dodges questions and does not articulate himself ON THE ISSUES.  
  
In any debate, or in any speech, Huckabee uses zingers and witty stories to dodge his way out of explaining the tough questions. This is true, WATCH HIM.  
  
Finally, I don't say that being nice or honest, or being religious is a bad thing. I DO say that these are the only things Huckabee has going for him. I would hope that my president is a personable guy. I would also hope though, that he has some policy knowledge (experienced or no) and can cogently explain himslef and his positions without referencing Chuck Norris or some religious anecdote from boyhood. All of my points from the first round go unanswered. You don't answer the fact that Huckabee would be unable to beat the Democrats, or that his zealous relgious nature (doesn't believe in evolution) would take the party back decades. You don't answer the fact that he doesn't have political merit (experience is different).  
  
Huckabee has proven to us that he doesn't not have the political where-with-all to win the presidency. My point in this debate is that his nomination would be a damaging embarassment to the party and that he doesn't deserve to be our nominee. You haven't responded to any point on this subject, merely pointed out that Huckabee is a likeable guy (which I don't deny). But, the fact that he is likeable is part of the problem. Thats all he has to offer as a candidate (as I have illustrated above) and I fear (as do many other republicans) that his nomination would bite us in the long run. What have you said that proves me otherwise?",Politics,3,Mike-Huckabee.....embarassing/1/,36681,0.5839822888374329

"Quickly I will address each of these issues. 1. Your understanding is incorrect. The Bible cannot be understood using logic alone. It does not even prove the existence of God.

"Not surprised that the only anti-feminists here are 14-year-old boys. I wish I could meet you so I could smack you and teach you that grown men support female rights.

You need to provide a credible source if you're going to claim that a massive movement is based off of the hating half of the world. The main argument for the reason of feminism is not the wage gap, it is the inequality that still exists today and the wage gap is just a part of that. The wage gap has been disproven by taking into account why women don't get paid as much. One of the reasons is pregnancy. So women shouldn't get paid as much because they have to go through something terrible like pregnancy and childbirth? No, they are going through something more difficult than us men.

"One moral arguement for staying in Iraq is that to leave Iraq would cause humanitarian issues for Iraqis. 1. This argument is flawed because according to one poll 82% of Iraqis are ""strongly opposed"" to the coalition's presence. <URL>.

That brings me to my next point: 2.

One moral arguement for staying in Iraq is that to leave Iraq would cause humanitarian issues for Iraqis.  
  
1. This argument is flawed because according to one poll 82% of Iraqis are ""strongly opposed"" to the coalition's presence.  
www.USliberals.about.com\od\homelandsecurit1\a\iraqnumbers.com.  
  
The Iraqi people know what's best for their own self interests, and if both parties (Iraq and the U.S.) think that withdrawall is in their best interests, we should withdraw.  
  
That brings me to my next point:

"We'll start off with some definitions: 1) Marriage: the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law Miriam-Webster @2009 2) abolish: to end the observance or effect of Miriam-Webster @2009 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is my contention that marriage should cease to be recognized as a legal institution as it is discriminatory in nature and in violation of any number of Constitutional amendments (The 14th in particular). In turn, all the social and economic benefits inherent to a ""marriage"" should be transfered to the legal contracts defining civil unions, thereby reaffirming marriage as a solely religious exercise. My reasoning for this course of action is two fold: 1) Constitutional Requirement for Equality. The 14th Amendment states: "" No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States...nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"" (1). I will now demonstrate that ""marriage"" licenses as they are now understood are unconstitutional. Example A: Immigration rights A United States citizen who is married can sponsor his or her non-American spouse for immigration. Those with Civil Unions do not have the opportunity to do so, effectively denying them equal rights and protections under the law guaranteed by 14th Amendment. (2) Therefore, the ability of a marriage license to ""abridge"" the rights of one group of people when compared to another is illegal and must be abolished. Example B: Taxes. Civil Unions are not recognized by the federal government, so they cannot file joint-tax returns or be eligible for tax breaks or protections the government affords to married couples. (2) This viewed in any legal context would be defined as systemic discrimination and economic persecution of a distinct minority group - something forbidden by the 14th Amendment as a lack of ""equal protection under the law"". Therefore, marriage licenses on the basis of their discriminatory application of federal benefits are unconstitutional. Example C: Socio-economic Benefits: The N.O.W. lists 1,400 benefits and protections available to heterosexual married couples, not also universally available to homosexual couples (3). The benefits exclusive to heterosexual couples, and denied to civil unions on the basis of legality, range from: 1) Federal Survivor Benefits through Social Security 2) Federally guaranteed ""Sick Leave"" for an ailing partner / child. 3) Access to COBRA unemployment insurance benefits. 4) Numerous tax breaks provided by the IRS to ""married"" couples. 5) Veteran's benefits ranging from health insurance to disabilities. 6) Legal visitation right of a spouse in the hospital / prison system. 7) Making medical / legal decisions if your partner is unable to. Any one of these benefits conferred to only heterosexual couples violates the 14th Amendment, again requiring that ""marriage"" be abolished as a legal contract based upon its discriminatory and selective application of benefits to a majority. It should now be resolved that we must remove these arbitrary benefits inherent to possessing a ""marriage"" license as is Constitutionally mandated. In turn, society must legally transfer those same benefits onto a non-discriminatory civil union contract, effectively curtailing the socio-economic discrimination and conforming to the legal necessities of equality as delegated by the constitution. 2) Rights of Religion Despite by personal beliefs about Religion, it has become a foundational belief of our society that people of faith should be allowed to believe whatever they want. In turn, their ""rights to belief"" as provided by the First Amendment must be protected. Therefore, I cannot morally justify forcing them to allow the ""marriage"" of people they see unfit to do so - they cannot legally be required to change their religious ceremonies as it would violate their ""freedom"". Instead, what society can do - and in my opinion morally must do - is remove any economic and social benefits granted to a discriminatory contract or belief system. Therefore those people that still wished to be ""married"" after receiving a civil union for the socio-economical benefits, and who are allowed to under the tenants of that particular religion, can do so knowing that the ""sanctity"" of their marriage is intact while society at large avoids supporting such ""protected"" discrimination. It should be readily apparent that this contention is the only logical course of action as it would both promote both a necessary and required equality under the law - a Constitutional obligation we have to uphold - and simultaneously would also reaffirm the rights of religions and their followers to be intolerant ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1: <URL>... 2: Kathy Belge; About.com 3: <URL>...",0,Eris,"

"Thank you for your swift response. My opponent has not yet responded to any of my opening arguments in favor of the Balanced Budget Amendment. I ask that he does so in the next post. War and National Emergencies I agree that there are times when a high military budget is needed such as during the Cold War. However, both Section 6 and 7, as I already noted, give provisions: Section 6. The Congress may waive the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war against a nation-state is in effect and in which a majority of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress shall provide for a specific excess by a roll call vote. Section 7. The Congress may waive the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this article in any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in a military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by three-fifths of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress by a roll call vote . Such suspension must identify and be limited to the specific excess of outlays for that fiscal year made necessary by the identified military conflict. <URL>... During natural emergencies, such as during a tornado or during something like Hurricane Sandy, the federal government should provide some help, however there ought to be strict guidelines for giving out money during these times. For example, there was a ton of fraud related to the Hurricane Katrina package that cost tax payers more than 2 billion dollars. Fraud included pay for Caribbean vacations, NFL tickets, Dom Perignon champagne, 'Girls Gone Wild' videos, and at least one sex change operation [1] Recessions The FDR example was not to prove that Roosevelt, or his new deal was wrong, but just to back up the claim that government spending and stimulus spending does NOT relieve, reform, or recover from a recession. It is certainly true that government loses revenue during recession (the worst thing possible during a recession is raising taxes and increase spending!). As the About.com page for economics reports, there are several factors that lead to this [2] : 1. The economy goes into recession, costing many workers their jobs, and at the same time causing corporate profits to decline. This causes less income tax revenue to flow to the government, along with less corporate income tax revenue. Occasionally the flow of income to the government will still grow, but at a slower rate than inflation, meaning that flow of tax revenue has fallen in real terms. 2.

  Thank you for your swift response. My opponent has not yet responded to any of my opening arguments in favor of the Balanced Budget Amendment. I ask that he does so in the next post.     
  War and National Emergencies  
     
  I agree that there are times when a high military budget is needed such as during the Cold War. However, both Section 6 and 7, as I already noted, give provisions:  
  
  Section 6.     The Congress may waive the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war against a nation-state is in effect   and in which a majority of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress shall provide for a specific excess by a roll call vote.  
  Section 7.     The Congress may waive the provisions of sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of this article in any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in a military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by three-fifths of the duly chosen and sworn Members of each House of Congress by a roll call vote  . Such suspension must identify and be limited to the specific excess of outlays for that fiscal year made necessary by the identified military conflict.

  During natural emergencies, such as during a tornado or during something like Hurricane Sandy, the federal government should provide some help, however there ought to be strict guidelines for giving out money during these times. For example, there was a ton of fraud related to the Hurricane Katrina package that cost tax payers more than 2 billion dollars. Fraud included pay for Caribbean vacations, NFL tickets, Dom Perignon champagne, ‘Girls Gone Wild’ videos, and at least one sex change operation   [1]     
  Recessions  
     
  The FDR example was not to prove that Roosevelt, or his new deal was wrong, but just to back up the claim that government spending and stimulus spending   does NOT   relieve, reform, or recover from a recession.  
  It is certainly true that government loses revenue during recession (the worst thing possible during a recession is raising taxes and increase spending!). As the About.com page for economics reports, there are several factors that lead to this   [2]  :  
  
  1.      The economy goes into recession, costing many workers their jobs, and at the same time causing corporate profits to decline. This causes less income tax revenue to flow to the government, along with less corporate income tax revenue. Occasionally the flow of income to the government will still grow, but at a slower rate than inflation, meaning that flow of tax revenue has fallen in     real terms.  
  2.      Because many workers have lost their jobs, there is increased use of government programs, such as unemployment insurance. Government spending rises as more individuals are calling on government services to help them out through tough times.  
  3.      To help push the economy out of recession and to help those who have lost their jobs, governments often create new social programs during times of recession and depression. FDR's ""New Deal"" of the 1930s is a prime example of this. Government spending then rises, not just because of increased use of existing programs, but through the creation of new programs.  
  
  Because of factors one, the government receives less money from taxpayers, while factors two and three, the government spends more money. Money starts flowing out of the government faster than it comes in, causing the government's budget to go into deficit.

"Con, thank you for your contribution. Women face injustice all around the world; in many cultures, even today, a male baby is preferable to a female baby to give you an example. Starting before their birth, women have to continuously deal with inequality. This unfairness may thus lead to a conscious or unconscious feeling of inferiority. Women have been told how to act, what to say, what to wear, more than men and so we can notice that a little girl is, more often, perfectly aware of her gender role, of the role of the feminine in the society than a little boy is of his. Imitating her mother, learning from her entourage, the little girl faces a stricter education. To reaffirm their existence, women started the feminist movement in the 1960s (women's fight against sexism can not be limited to this movement of course). Today, both victims of and partially leading to the hypersexualization phenomena, women are, even though they get the illusion that they are making their own choices, for most influenced by existing authorities. Buying a simple item of clothing because they want to doesn't mean that they are fully in control of their actions. We are surrounded by media messages,that offer women 'role models' they should look up to. Prejudices and the existing system in our societies push women to try pleasing men's expectations too. Even though it looks like it is getting better (and it is) and that women are in power, they are under pressure and unconsciously our consciously guided by authorities and media above mentioned. In addition to this, since we are debating on the hypersexualization of young girls, we should take in consideration their age, and the fact that they are, at their age (8-13) too young to make that kind of decisions without any guidance.",0,Hypersexualisation,"

Buying a simple item of clothing because they want to doesn't mean that they are fully in control of their actions. We are surrounded by media messages,that offer women 'role models' they should look up to. Prejudices and the existing system in our societies push women to try pleasing men's expectations too. Even though it looks like it is getting better (and it is) and that women are in power, they are under pressure and unconsciously our consciously guided by authorities and media above mentioned.  
  
In addition to this, since we are debating on the hypersexualization of young girls, we should take in consideration their age, and the fact that they are, at their age (8-13) too young to make that kind of decisions without any guidance.",Society,1,The-hypersexualization-of-little-girls-is-a-step-backwards-for-feminism./1/,64723,0.005888070445507765
"I thank my opponent for presenting his arguments, and will now offer mine without adding a rebuttal to his as per the rules of this debate. The question posed here is whether or not divorce should be encouraged (allowed), or better said, should the status quo be maintained. As the con side, I will show why exactly the status quo should be maintained, and that there is a very good reason why divorce is legal and allowed at present. 1. Unfulfillment of the role of marital unions To begin with, it is clear that the union that is marriage has certain roles it has to fulfill. Marriage is, in its core, a union formed between two people, formed out of love, and with the goal to live, prosper etc. together. Marriage changes one's life drastically and is based on stability, understanding and compromise - those are the prerequisites for a marital union to be functional and to last. The role of marital unions is to bind two people and help them achieve all their goals, prosper, and lead a stable and generally happy life. As stated before, synergy is key to the stability of a marital union - should that synergy disappear, the marital union cannot fulfill any of its roles; and it loses its reason of existence. A few basics make lasting love possible in marriage. These include caring, long-term commitment, integrity, togetherness and maintaining a positive focus. [1] That being said, it is clear there are functional, as well as dysfunctional marriages. Divorce serves as a solution to a situation where the marital union is dysfunctional, and, in the eyes of the couple, beyond repair. When the couple reaches a point where they simply cannot function together, there is no point in preserving the marriage - its dysfunctionality will prevent it from being of any use to anybody. It is only natural that such a bond as marriage, which has a large impact on one's life, can be dissolved. No one can predict what will happen concerning the relations between the two people in the marital union, and for that reason, the right to divorce must be maintained. Marriage isn't really about the two united against the world, but rather the two individuals in a world full of mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual challenges and surprises. [...] When two people are simply unable to sustain their love for each other and are unwilling to spend the remainder of their life in what is left of their relationship, then divorce becomes a way to set each other free. [2] To grasp the necessity of divorce, one must understand that divorces aren't monsters waiting behind the corner to destroy a couple's happiness and harmony. A divorce is the consequence of a pre-existing problem which eliminated the functionality of the marriage and set it beyond repair. At that point, the couple divorces, for they both realize their marriage is left hanging in a void; it is useless and causes them suffering. If it so, then what is the point of blindly insisting on preserving the marriage. What's the point and what good does it bring? The answer is self-evident - none. That is, indeed, the reason that divorce is legal and allowed in the status quo. 2. Quality of life It is clear that every single human being strives for the highest possible quality of life. A person's quality of life is incredibly important for the well-being of said person, and should be ameliorated and augmented by all means. That much is logical and understandable. A dysfunctional marriage hinders one's quality of life severely. As was already stated, marriage is a grand decision that has a great impact on the life of the two individuals of which it consists. If that impact is negative, why shouldn't the couple be allowed to divorce? Who has the right to force two people to be unhappy? Who has the right to force them to uphold a lifestyle they do not wish to uphold, to hinder their quality of life, to prolong their emotional distress? And to what end? Indeed, what end would not allowing divorce be a means to? What, exactly, is achieved and preserved by not allowing divorce? Allowing couples to divorce gives the two individuals a chance to restore happiness to their lives should it be lost in the marriage. It ultimately preserves their right to living happily and freely. Forcing them to stay in a union they would do anything to get out of is nothing more than a form of slavery. If one were to look at the big picture, it is the right to divorce that indirectly helps preserve quality of life. Both members of a certain marital union are aware that they have a way out, a way to restore things to how they were in case they made a mistake. That right is an important part of modern family life - for a reason, too. I have proven throughout this exposition that the right to divorce ameliorates quality of life, forms one of the pillars of modern family life and aids in ensuring that a dysfunctional union can be promply dissolved. On the other hand, huge questions rest over the case that supports not allowing divorce. Questions to which one cannot offer a logical, humane answer. Back to my opponent. SOURCES: [1] <URL>...

And it is all too true that grades vary widely because of four factors: a teacher's conception of achievement, a teacher's sense of equity and rigor, a teacher's ability, and the composition of students. But people are already gaming standardized testing, sometimes criminally. And, at a basic level of competency, a grade or an evaluative report would give us as much information as we now get from standardized tests. We have the grade problem at my high school.

"Thank you for taking on this debate, Good Luck! My opponent states ""It means literally that you are ""UNDER--- AGE."" That means the child is not only property of their parent, but they must have control in what their child does."" If that is what underage means then let's take a quick side note. The drinking age is 21 years old, if a 20 year old is drinking in their own apartment (where they live without their parents, pay their own bills, etc.) their parent should have control in what their child is doing? I find that to be absurd that a child is considered ""property"" of their parents. I will now get back to the debate on abortion and parental consent. I would like you to consider rape. Once again my opponent states ""you got pregnant you should not be ashamed of what you have done, because you did."" If the adolescent was raped, by force, drugs, drinking, whatever it may be, and had sex without her consent and became pregnant often they will feel ashamed. Rape victims often feel guilt, powerless, embarrassed, and ashamed. Which is also another reason for an adolescent to feel uneasy about talking to their parents, not only would their daughter have to explain the rape but also relive it in their mind. (1) Another issue with receiving parental consent can be the delay in the abortion process. Parental consent can impose a delay into the abortion process, which increases the likelihood of complications. Generally speaking, the earlier in pregnancy an abortion takes place, the safer it is. The adolescent can now face health problems if their parent does not agree to have an abortion. For the mother's health, it is better not to require parental consent so it does not delay the process. If the parents take their time in discussing the issue at hand their daughter will be in danger. (1) <URL>...",0,mjordan,"

Conrad Hilton himself left virtually all of his fortune to the charity when he died, a charity that he founded to do great things... yet my opponent's position of being In Favor of the Estate Tax would mean that all or most of one's estate be mandated to go directly to the government upon one's passing. An estate tax is a bad idea for several reasons. First, it is more wise for an individual to invest in a trustworthy organization that they believe in than to invest in the government. Say I died and $1B of mine went to the White House. Certainly George Bush would be using that money to continue to wage war on Islamic nations - a war that I do not agree with. Therefore my money is being used to support policies that I do not. Similarly, a Conservative may not want their hard-earned money to go to programs such as Welfare or Medicaid. If I had donated my estate to a charity that collects money for breast cancer research, I would be content to know that my contribution helped to save lives, not take them. And since it is my money, I should be able to support whatever programs I choose - not leave it up to the government to decide how my money gets dispersed. Afterall, what if they agree upon a huge Dick Cheney pay increase or something just as upsetting? Another reason why an estate tax is wrong is because it can hurt the family of the individual whose estate is being taken away. For example, many people place significant value on family heirlooms, which are defined as a valued possessions that are passed down in a family through succeeding generations; articles of personal property included in an inherited estate (dictionary.com). If an estate tax were implemented, heirlooms would no longer take precedent over the government, and memories or other valuables would be lost. Rather than supporting an estate tax, I believe that an individual should be held responsible for that year's annual income taxes due in full by the following April 15th after their death just as they would if they were still alive. Aside from that, I feel that a person's will (if they have one) shall determine where the rest of their estate goes once they die. If they do not have a will, whatever the current procedure is in determining dispersement shall continue, but an estate tax shall NOT. ---------------------------------------- Thank you in advance for accepting this debate.

"You state that all throughout history, and even into the future that ""Wars have been, and will continue to be, generally necessary; with good results common."" However, I believe that this cannot be farther from the truth, and I am going to break down the question to first prove why war has not always been necessary, and why they do not have ""common good results."" (For the rest of my argument I am going to use conflict as a synonym for war, as the last ""true"" war according to American law was WWII.) While war is certainly a valid diplomatic tool that has had success in the past, it is almost never completely neccesary, which is defined in the Princeton dictionary as ""absolutely essential."" Ask any politician or foreign advisor, and they will almost all say the same thing, that war as a diplomatic option must only be considered when absolutely EVERYTHING else has been tried and failed. When a conflict is undertaken before other diplomatic options are taken, disaster usually occurs. An example of this was the CONTRA affair, or the Bay of Pigs. Reagan and Kennedy, respectively, felt that war was essential and the best option, and invaded both Nicaragua and Cuba, respectively. These two conflicts ended in disaster which could have been averted if diplomatic efforts were taken before. And while some wars have been ultimately necessary, an example being WWII, there have been at least two wars which would have been averted with diplomacy for every neccesary and just war. My second point is that wars do not often have, and on the contrary rarely do have, ""common good results."" One key example that comes to mind is the Vietnam War. America invaded the communist nation, in hopes turning into a capitalistic society. WHat occurred there became forever known as a synonym for a barbaric and atrocious crusade for faux democracy, and for a failed war. Thousands of American deaths occurred there, not to mention the tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese lives that were lost, and to tell me these were good results would be an utter lie. This occurs in a great deal of wars, and while some of the deaths may be neccesary, a great deal of other effects occur.

The belief that there can be no proof either that God exists or that God does not exist. <URL>...

"We should note that, strictly speaking, Pro just blew up his own argument. Pro argued in the first round that the LGBT rights movement is not comparable to other civil rights movements. Pro's second argument compared LGBT rights movement to other civil rights movement (I.e. job rights vs. marriage rights) and admitted there were ""small parallels."" Pro seems to have exempted himself from the rule he promotes: these movements should not be compare d. I suspect that the spirit of Pro's argument is that the LGBT rights movement is by one measure inferior to other civil rights movements. Pro's measure is that most civil rights movements are concerned with inalienable rights, while LGBT rights movements are generally concerned with marriage equality. I would argue that marriage equality is an inalienable right, in as much that it really doesn't matter what church or state tells you. When two people decide to share their lives, they generally disregard those institutions that tell them otherwise. Neither Capulets nor Montagues could tell Romeo and Juliet they weren't married. Neither Blacks nor Whites could tell Richard and Mildred Loving they weren't married. Neither France nor the U.S could tell Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas they weren't married. Marriage is a state of mind, a promise kept by two people irregardless of doctrine, or law, or pain of death. Inalienable. But we should also note that LGBT rights movements are concerned with far more the question of marriage equality. In fact, popular movements for marriage equality are a relatively new political phenomenon, built on the foundation of generations of struggle. Many of the issues addressed by LGBT movements address rights that Pro would recognize as inalienable. Let us agree that three inalienable rights are those noted in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. LIFE- There are several LGBT movements devoted to preserving the lives of LGBT around the globe. In Iran, for example, the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees helps Gays escape from a country that still retains the death penalty for homosexuality. There are 7 nations that still retain capital punishment for homosexuals and 2 countries considering adopting the death penalty for gays. All of these nations maintain activist organizations that oppose these laws and many other civil rights organizations frequently condemn these laws and work to change them. In Uganda, where a death penalty for homosexuals has overwhelming popular support, only activist appeals to global organizations and leaders has prevented the implementation of a proposed death penalty. LIBERTY- There are 76 countries where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by anything from fines, to whipping, to life imprisonment. There are hundreds of organization working to change these laws and/or free gay people serving time. Russia is a good example. Although rights for homosexuals were granted in 1917 after the Russian Revolution, discrimination against LGBT peoples has been on the rise for years and recent waves of murders, mass arrests, and anti-gay legislation has ignited a strong international backlash from LGBT activists and human rights advocates. As a result, multiple celebrities have recently cancelled tours or visits to Russia. Actor Stephen Fry initiated a movement calling for a relocation or boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics unless Russia can guarentee improved freedoms for LGBT peoples. PURSUIT of HAPPINESS- Well, this all over the place, but let's look at employment discrimination in the US, since Pro brought this up as an example of an inalienable right. Only 21 states have laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Although employment discrimination has become far less popular in the last decade, there are still employers who actively seek to screen out LGBT people and fire LGBT upon discovery. Chick-fil-a is one employer who works hard to screen out LGBT people from management and ownership opportunities. The US Military is the largest employer in the world and only changed its policy of firing LGBT employees 13 months ago. I think I have successfully shown that LGBT rights movements have concerned themselves primarily with inalienable rights in the past and continue to do so today on a global scale, irrespective of whether PRO considers marriage equality an inalienable right.",0,Oromagi,"

"Pro begins round 3 with the illogical statement: (grammar mistakes quoted exactly) ""being a prostitute is about as dangers as being a fisherman."" This is either an intentional attempt to mislead, or a poor understanding of math and statistics. He states that the homicide rate for prostitutes is 200 and then tries to compare that to the death rate for fisherman. A true comparison would be the homicide rate of prostitutes to the homicide rate for fisherman or the death rate for prostitutes to the death rate for fishermen. I would have more sympathy for this error if PRO had not misquoted the facts so obviously. Death rate by homicide in active prostitutes was 229[1], but the overall death rate (CMR) was 459. Compare this to the CMR for USA (9) or Canadian (8) general population.[2] This makes a prostitute 50 times more likely to die than an average citizen. I was surprised to learn that ""Homicide is the second leading cause of death on the job for workers in the United States.""[3] The major factors were listed in the study as "" contact with the public; exchange of money; and working alone, at night, or in high-crime areas are risk factors for workplace homicide Several studies also report high rates of homicide associated with taxicab services, grocery stores, convenience stores, bars, nightclubs, and gasoline stations.""

This was from a ""study"" claiming the safety merits of legalized brothel prostitution. Let me recap why Prostitution should NOT be legal Simply allowing the sale of sex for money will not remove the problems of prostitution. Because this is a state (not federal) issue in the US, the laws that grow up around prostitution will be a patchwork of local and state regulations that encourage sex trafficking and other criminal activity. We use legislation to protect society, and the dangers of prostitution merit tighter laws and more enforcement to keep people from getting into sex trades too easily. There are many health issues of promiscuity. These are not only issues for sex workers, but for their customers, and for the intimate partners of those customers. The best way to limit harm is to keep prostitution illegal, and to find more effective methods of enforcement. Prostitution has many links to organized crime and illegal drug use. These ties will not simply disappear if prostitution were legalized. This would give more money laundering opportunities to criminal enterprise. In The US the average age of entry into street prostitution is 12-14 years .[5] Sex slavery and sex trafficking are a core part of prostitution , even in countries like Germany where it is legal. Legalization only makes the numbers larger. We have legislation to protect the vulnerable. There are age restrictions for alcohol and tobacco. Many drugs are prohibited completely. Speed limits are enforced. In Prostitution, the dangers to the workers and their clients are so high (and there are no benefits) that it needs to be completely prohibited. The prohibition against men taking advantage of women by making them prostitutes is ancient,[6] and there is no reason to think society will get better by legalizing prostitution. As the USA moves towards universal health care and socialized medicine there is an even bigger need to reduce, not increase, prostitution. As the taxpayer ends up paying the cost for medical care of prostitutes and their clients you will pay a huge cost for legalized prostitution.

"Contention 1: Does not attack the core of our economic slowdown. The essence of our economic slowdown is caused by unemployment. The 2008 economic stimulus act does not advocate any benefits for the unemployed. Since the act does not attack the very core issues of our suffering economy, it thus will be insufficient in mitigating economic slowdowns. Contention 2: ""Consumer Confidence Boost"" is empirically false. Although the idea behind the stimulus package is mainly to increase consumer spending, the truth is: The tax incentives do not work. 1) Targets the wrong people. It gives people with higher income more money, and people less well off with less money. However, it fails to realize that people with less money are more likely to spend money given to them. Richer people are less likely to do so. 2) People will not spend this money. Many people are in debts at the moment. The act will only work if a substantial amount of people spend their rebates. However, over 60% already claimed that they will be either a) pocketing the cash, or b) paying taxes off. With over half of the nation not actually spending the money, the stimulus act evidently does not uphold the idea of ""consumer confidence"". Because the Stimulus Package does not boost consumer confidence like it promises, the economy will continue into downfall. REBUTTALS: Contention 1: The proposition claims that spending will increase. This is flawed for two reasons: 1) As stated above, over half of the nation claims they will not be directly spending their cash. Thus, spending will not drastically increase. The opponent's arguments only work in theory, and as when applied realistically, it does not work. 2) $300 - $600 is not enough to boost the economy. With only 40% of the nation claiming to spend the money, this creates enough reason to doubt the actual validity of the half-a-K tax rebates. Even if all of the nation directly spends the money, there is still the chance that the stimulus act will not work.

In short, the argument is non-relevant. Contention 2B: Once again, we come across a problem of relevancy.

Contention 3: The opponent says that more people are going to be hired. There is no mention of HOW or WHY this would happen. We cannot just sit and expect the stimulus act to start lowering unemployment rates, and the proposition offers no evidence as to why it WOULD lower unemployment rates. This argument clearly offers no clear reason as to why the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act would lower unemployment rates.

Contention 1: Does not attack the core of our economic slowdown.  
The essence of our economic slowdown is caused by unemployment.  
The 2008 economic stimulus act does not advocate any benefits for the unemployed.  
Since the act does not attack the very core issues of our suffering economy, it thus will be insufficient in mitigating economic slowdowns.  
  
Contention 2: ""Consumer Confidence Boost"" is empirically false.  
Although the idea behind the stimulus package is mainly to increase consumer spending, the truth is: The tax incentives do not work.  
1) Targets the wrong people.  
It gives people with higher income more money, and people less well off with less money.  
However, it fails to realize that people with less money are more likely to spend money given to them. Richer people are less likely to do so.  
2) People will not spend this money.  
Many people are in debts at the moment.  
The act will only work if a substantial amount of people spend their rebates. However, over 60% already claimed that they will be either a) pocketing the cash, or b) paying taxes off.  
With over half of the nation not actually spending the money, the stimulus act evidently does not uphold the idea of ""consumer confidence"".  
Because the Stimulus Package does not boost consumer confidence like it promises, the economy will continue into downfall.

"Thanks for taking up the debate! I'll get right into addressing your criticisms (written as if to a third party): We see the greatest objection appear to lie in Paradigm's usage of philosophy (specifically ontology), the nature of time, space, and matter. He makes two claims: (1) That nothing can exist without a cause, and that thus it requires spacetime to have a beginning. (2) Space and time comprise something called space and are inextricably linked to one another. On both of these claims I agree, and will seek to demonstrate how they do not assist his argument for a singularity. Let me begin by addressing (1). I agree entirely that in our daily lives every material entity has a cause. This message appears on the internet because I submitted it, for example. There are countless examples of causality everywhere in nature. However, the scope of your argument can thus only fall to things within nature, and not nature itself. That is, while everything within a set obeys a certain property (causality) it does not follow that the set itself obeys that property, especially when the property is defined by the set! (causality makes no sense without time!) This is easily demonstrable by analogy: The United Nations is comprised of various nations from around the world. Does this imply that the United Nations is itself a nation? Is the set of all even numbers itself an even number? Most certainly not. Likewise, while all objects within nature existing in time are subject to causality, this certainly does not imply that time (or nature) itself is subject to causality. In fact, it is most logical to state that time could not have begun, for the very notion of a beginning implies the existence of a time with which to compare (as coming into existence is a sequential act. Time cannot have come into existence without a time before from it to have sprung!) Secondly, I come to (2). As a physics major I have no qualms with the notion of spacetime, and do not disagree with the notion that with one necessarily comes the other. However, what I fail to recognize is how this is a problem for my argument. Paradigm asks ""Now, consider that there was no singularity, no point in which time began. Would time itself then become timeless? Surely not just on a philosophical level, because time outside of space means nothing, and indeed, could not exist in actuality-- never mind conceptually."" I addressed the problem with the notion of beginning of time above. Now, without a beginning of time this does not negate the fact that causal events occur. It simply means that there was no beginning to time. An analogy may help: on a line of real numbers, there is an infinite number of these, stretching from negative infinity to infinity (which are not real numbers in themselves but denote the notion of being able to add a number on forever in either direction). Now, on the real number line I can always locate points, say, 1 and 2. And I can get from 1 to 2 by the addition of 1. Time likewise behaves similarly. There is always a finite distance between two points, while time itself is infinite in extent. The fact that space and time are linked does nothing to affect my argument: as long as space exists, time exists. If time is infinite, this just means the universe has always existed. Lastly I come to the empirical claim: that Hubble's redshift can be used to demonstrate that time itself had an origin. Hubble's redshift, for those who don't know, is a line relating galaxy distance to velocity. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it goes. The conclusion is that if we bring all these galaxies back together, there must be a point in time that they were all smashed together into a single point, the Big Bang singularity. There are multiple problems with deducing this: Hubble's Law (which results in this relationship) in it's simplest formulation is based off of a Newtonian metric, which, while useful for many astronomical calculations, becomes increasingly useless as both relativity and quantum mechanics come into play. Likewise, more complicated and accurate formulations take into account relativity, but leave out the play of quantum mechanics. This is for good reason, quantum effects do not mean anything until we get to a region where Hubble's Law is entirely useless. While great for galaxies, we are talking about a time when all of space was contained within a region smaller than a proton. The fundamental forces were united and behaved in a manner different than what Hubble's Law is theoretically based off of. And most importantly, gravity is quantized, which greatly affects the expansion of space (as energy density results in a gravitational tug, and energy density was quite high during the pre-Planck universe.) Extrapolation of Hubble's Law prior to (or during) the inflationary epoch is also unwarranted. This is because while the Hubble relationship took into account some basic relativity, the metric involved in Inflation is quite different and based on different parameters. We certainly do not apply the inflation metric past the point where it approximates the Hubble metric, nor should we do the opposite and apply Hubble where he's not correct. Likewise, prior to inflation gravity itself is quantized, and this means we shouldn't apply either Hubble or Inflationary metrics without great hesitation! Neither of these metrics are quantized, which means neither of these metrics are appropriate during pre-Planck era work.",0,Lucretius,"

This allows room for students to get picked on for what they wear. 2. I realize that your sense of clothing does not say everything about your personality, however I would like to bring up the point that not everyone looks good in the same color and style of clothing. For example, I have light green eyes and blond hair. I do not look good in royal blue. I find it unfair to force students to wear articles of clothing that: A) Gainsay their usual style of clothing, ultimately going against there personality, and: B) They may not look the best in; possibly belittling their sense of style. 4.

I don't think that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to choose what you wear and get dressed.

"I'm slighty disappointed because I was looking forward to this debate, but I appreciate Pro's concession and am excited to see that I may have changed his mind on this issue. That, after all, is what we strive for with debate, and it warms my heart that I was able to do that. For fun, I'm going to respond to some of the points that Pro made in the last two rounds. Controversial Topic I don't deny that the topic of God's existence is a popular or even controversial topic that exictes many member's, and rightfully so. It's a pervasive, thought-provoking question that we inescapable will come to face with at some point or another in contemplating our mortality. However, it is the fact that it *is* a controversial topic which ought to preclude us from making it a big issue: they say that religion and politics are the touchy subjects that we ought not discuss at the dining room table for a reason. People hold starkly different positions on the existence of a deity or even their conceptions of a deity, so attempting to conceptualize this notion by way of, as Pro suggests, O3 is far oversimplifying the issue. The O3 conception leaves out omnipresence, to name one, and scientific debates which focus on pinpointing the first cause would often focus on a deistic god. This doesn't even account for the pantheistic god that Christopher Langan and many others argue for. The point is, precisely because the issue is so pervasive and widespread is why it should not be a Big Issue. It cannot be properly pinned down nor precisely delineated, so it wold necessarily give rise to ambiguity and contentious kerfuffles among members, as well as highly variable framework analyses. The topic is *not* agreeable, as Pro contends. It will necessarily lead to the clashing of strong personalities, and well that it desirable at times, we should be promoting it with respect to something productive and conducive to intellectual advancement--that cannot possibly be the case with something as elusive and as difficult to formalize as ""god."" Ambiguity Pro contends that, in spite of your religion, conceptions of God will tend to converge to O3. I have already demonstrated why this will not be the case of light of deism, pantheism, and polytheism. People even within different sects of Christianity, or of varying degrees of devoutness, may have differing views as to God's wraith and the role of the Old Testament of the Bible in their lives and religion. Existence Pro seems to have missed my point with respect to existence. Surely people could debate whether God's existence matters, but that is non-topical to our discussion at hand because the Big Issue would be ""Does God exist?"" He seems to concede, with this point, that there is a distinction between objective and subjective existence, which would necessarily make it extremely difficult and near-impossible to adequately define God such that we could establish a universal, DDO-wide definition. Truth Value Pro seems to concede that God doesn't have truth value, but then tries to liken the issue to gay marriage. However, as I mentioned in the last round, gay marriage involves appeals to morality as well as objective and empirical facts, such as sociological research on child rearing and adoption. Philosophical arguments to the effect of free will versus omniscience and the problem of evil could make for fascinating debates, but that would require defining God as 03, which would necessarily preclude various conceptions of God and disenfranchise a host of people with fundamentally different views. I thank Pro for engaging in this debate with me, and look forward to the possibility of debating him again in the future.",0,JollyTodd,"

Humans in labs have breed fruit flies into entirely new species. //Any attempts to do so have ended in sterilization when the animal was bred to far./ Again you are wrong. It is true that the new species cannot breed with the old but that is the very definition of a species but they are viable and thus your argument falls. Next off, Darwin's finches are a prime example of a time when evolution via natural selection has cause diversity. Here I have provided you with more evidence and you will win if you disprove the chicken/dino evidence, disprove the fossil record and disprove Darwin's finches. Also may I remind the readers that my opponent has provided no definitions to any thing.

If you compare the DNA of chickens and dinosaurs the similarities are remarkable. Also, the fact that they have the exact same gene for making teeth as dinosaurs do is an added bonus.[1]  
  
About micro and macro, macro is just lots of micro evolutions...  
  
//However evolution from one species to another has never been observed even with human intervention such as breeding//  
False. Humans in labs have breed fruit flies into entirely new species.  
  
//Any attempts to do so have ended in sterilization when the animal was bred to far./  
Again you are wrong. It is true that the new species cannot breed with the old but that is the very definition of a species but they are viable and thus your argument falls.  
  
Next off, Darwin's finches are a prime example of a time when evolution via natural selection has cause diversity.  
  
Here I have provided you with more evidence and you will win if you disprove the chicken/dino evidence, disprove the fossil record and disprove Darwin's finches. Also may I remind the readers that my opponent has provided no definitions to any thing.  
  
If there is anything else you want ask but here I must say that if you can find a poodle in the precambrian era evolution is false. You should be doing work to disprove evolution. That is how the peer review forum works yet you ignore this and do no work for your case at all. I want to see what your next move is good sir.

The oldest woman ever was a vegetarian, and even if people smoke and are vegetarians they generally have a longer life expectancy. They are also less likely to have cancer and osteoporosis. Unless you have an IQ so low that you need a tape to tell you to breath, having these reduced risks and longevity of life would be seen as healthy due to the fact that you restrict your meat intake. Why is it so hard to comprehend? I would like to remind voters that even though these benefits are achieved through other forms of vegetarianism, pesci-vegetarianism is still beneficial. I would also like to remind you that there would not be billions of people jobless. We created diversified economies for this very reason. The fish industry would need more workers, as would the soy industry. Yes, jobs in the meat industry will disappear, but with new demands comes new jobs. And please remember, I never said that everyone should go vegetarian and not everyone will, but the people who do it (the number of vegetarians have increased to 10 times the number that they used to be), will benefit the environment, and if it keeps on growing at this rate, the economy will be able to go into a smooth transition. About elitism once more, people could make the same argument about gyms and other health centers. So maybe it is a type of elitism. Does it have a negative impact? Some people could say that because people are getting healthy that TV industries are at steak, which they are. But we do not see this as something that it necessarily harmful. That will not cause a WWIII, and neither will pesci-vegetarianism, as my opponent points out, so why won't people at least have respect for the idea. Besides, once again going back to the environment, will the environment wait for the economy to be perfect? No, which is why sometimes we have to realize that the earth itself is more important than money. My opponent claims that economic impacts outweigh environmental impacts.

"Side note: My apologies for being so late in replying (6.5 hours until the round was forfeited), I simply forgot. However I do feel I can make a compelling argument against my opponent. 1) My opponent states that the role of a government is to protect its citizens and prevent crime. A quick search on dictionary.com came out with a citizen being defined as ""an inhabitant of a city or town"" ( <URL>... ). Now, I see a loophole in this argument. It can be argued that a dog is an inhabitant of a city or town, simply because it inhabits the town, i.e. it lives there. So a dog could be seen as a citizen (well according to dictionary.com anyway). Therefore dogs would have equal rights as humans in this debate, seeing as all citizens are equal, are they not? ""First they would not be protecting its citizens (the postmen), and would secondly be allowing crime (denying of postman's autonomy)"" Dogs have a right to bite postmen! And as they are equal citizens it is simply a matter of choosing what side you are for: the dogs or the postmen? I am for the dogs for the simple reason that they outnumber postmen and that they are far more productive to society. A postman simply delivers letters and packages, when you could simply send an email, or be given a notice that there are packages waiting for you at the post office and get them yourself. Dogs however can be your loyal companions for the length of their lives (15 or so years). They can lead blind people, help police catch the drug dealers and other criminals, and even help people regain their health. For example here is a story about a dog helping keep a boy alive: <URL>... . Here is also a story about a dog helping an autistic boy ""connect with the world"" <URL>... So dogs are far more valuable to society then postmen. So therefore they should be given the right to bite them. 2) People would watch the TV show, simply because people love watching other people get hurt. Well some people do anyway. Look at the success of the show ""you've been framed"" ( <URL>... ). This show received a massive audience. The clips often showed people experiencing pain (falling over is a quite common subject). I argue that this new TV show receive viewings, simply because it would be depicting people experiencing pain in a comic matter. 3) I argue that the judges etc. should concentrate their energies on the topic of the sheep-mutant crossover because terrible things are happening at the moment. Poor innocent sheep are being raped, disgusting sheep-human mutants are being born, polluting the human genetics and really giving New Zealand a bad name. And this law would not concern the ""rest of the world"" either, it would concern NEW ZEALAND. So you really should have no interest in this law, because it does not concern ""the rest of the world"" as you have stated in your previous argument. 4) In point 2) I have shown that people DO find entertainment in other peoples pain. ""If you suggest that watching a dog bite a postman to death is entertainment, then you are being absolutely crazy and need to see a phsycologist"" That would be a matter of opinion. And the dogs would NOT bite the postmen to death, they would give them a little nip on the fingers. Well they might bite their trouser legs aswell. I cannot see my finding entertainment in either of those situations my needing to see a phsycologist. And I am NOT making fun of blind people. I stated two facts about them.

"I am in favor of the death penalty, because it is evident that, if implemented correctly, it can save innocent lives. The Death Penalty deters murder Until relatively recently there was little consensus on the impact of the death penalty on murder rates, however in the last decade, nine of twelve referenced academic studies by notable economists concluded that the death penalty does, in fact, deter murders[1]. Among the conclusions of those studies was one that determined each execution deters an average of 18 murders [2]. Other studies have estimated the deterred murders per execution at three, five and 14[3]. A controversial study conducted to evaluate the evidence of the ""innocent executed"" is the Bedau-Radelet Study. The study concluded that 23 innocent persons had been executed since 1900. However, the studies methodology was so flawed that at least 12 of those cases had no evidence of innocence and substantial evidence of guilt[4]. The remaining 11 cases represent 0.14% of the 7,800 executions which have taken place since 1900. And, there is, in fact, no proof that those 11 executed were innocent. Even if one uses the apparently most conservative numbers, we can calculate that the death penalty has deterred 7,800*3=~23400 murders of innocents and executed 11 innocents (which have not been conclusively proved innocent either). Thus, it is simply not true that a staggering number of innocent persons have been executed, as previously noted, yet even if it where true, the number of innocent lives saved by the death penalty exceed those that have been executed by a factor of ~20000%. Con argues that the state should not hold power over others, which contradicts the very nature and function of the state: to distribute power and resources. Con also argues that the state should not have jurisdiction over death, as murder is murder. Whilst I sympathise with this sentiment, it is evident to me that the murder of innocents is wrong, and that implementation of the Death Penalty will reduce it. References: [1] <URL>... [2] <URL>...

"polygamy was widespread in europe in ancient times. the early hibrew kings are polygamous. even king solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines. lets see an evidence: "" Polygamy, in ancient times, was widespread, but has become less common over time. The most common form of polygamy is polygyny. Polygynous marriages are found in the Old Testament, especially among the early Hebrew kings. The first recorded polygamist was Lamech (Genesis 4:19), in the seventh generation from Adam. The book of Deuteronomy gives an inheritance rule for polygynous families.[2] The culmination was Solomon with 700 wives and 300 concubines; however, the fact that they were from the pagan nations led him down the path of corruption.[3] There was also a practice of giving a maid servant to a husband to sire children in the period of the patriarchs; Scripture refers to such a maid servant variously as a wife[4] and as a concubine[5].

  polygamy was widespread in europe in ancient times. the early hibrew kings are polygamous. even king solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines. lets see an evidence:  ""  Polygamy, in ancient times, was widespread, but has become less common over time. The most common form of polygamy is polygyny. Polygynous marriages are found in the Old Testament, especially among the early Hebrew kings. The first recorded polygamist was Lamech (Genesis 4:19), in the seventh generation from Adam. The book of Deuteronomy gives an inheritance rule for polygynous families.[2] The culmination was Solomon with 700 wives and 300 concubines; however, the fact that they were from the pagan nations led him down the path of corruption.[3] There was also a practice of giving a maid servant to a husband to sire children in the period of the patriarchs; Scripture refers to such a maid servant variously as a wife[4] and as a concubine[5]. God, speaking through the prophet Nathan, addressed David's polygamy without expressing disapproval:      And Nathan said to David, Thou [art] the man.

"I would like to first thank socialpinko (Con) for this debate and to all the readers who will read this debate. My hope is that this debate won't be taken merely as an intellectual competition or a battle of logic and argumentation, but instead a discussion on a very important topic. I'm not here to win points by technicalities, my goal is not even to win a debate (though I will be trying my best to do so). My goal here is to tackle this issue at its very foundation and hopefully provide a sound argument for my position, while simultaneously demonstrating that the counter position is not intellectually tenable. I will be taking the Pro position in this debate and will be defending the resolution that ""homosexual acts are immoral"". DEFINITIONS I am in full agreement with Con in his definition of homosexual acts, ie ""Homosexual acts refer to consensual sex acts between two or more members of the same sex."" Now the definition of the term ""immoral"" is where the debate really is. I appreciate Con's definition as well as his following statement that shows that he is aware that he and I will have differing views on what constitutes immorality. I hope the readers will take this important detail into account. Now on to my argument.. This debate is not about whether or not homosexuality is a defect in nature, nor is this debate about whether homosexual acts should be legal or illegal. Those are different issues. This debate is about whether or not homosexuality, or homosexual acts to be specific, are immoral. This is a debate about a moral or ethical issue. This is important to note because morality and ethics transcend what is legal and what is natural. Though I chose to accept to defend the resolution that ""homosexual acts are immoral"", Con was the one who formulated this resolution. What I want to point out here is that Con and I both are presupposing a moral standard on which we can gauge what is immoral and therefore ground this debate. Con stated that ""For an action to be immoral means that it is contrary to right or to moral conduct."" This shows that Con will be arguing against the resolution on the basis of a moral standard. Con did however state that him and I ""will no doubt have differing views on what constitute immorality"". I very much appreciated this statement of his and though I think this is where the debate will get tricky, I hope that Con and I will get somewhere with this during our debate. ARGUMENT Con was exactly right when he said that we will no doubt have differing views on what constitutes immorality so I will begin my argument by putting forward my view, which is the Biblical view on morality as interpreted by Reformed Protestantism. God is absolute, with an unchanging moral character and is the standard of morality. Anything that is contrary to his absolute, unchanging character is therefore immoral. His commands and his word that he revealed through natural revelation and special revelation, ie. scripture, are expressions of his character and are therefore absolute, unchanging, and more importantly AUTHORITATIVE and binding. P1 God and His word is the standard of morality P2 The word of God teaches that homosexual acts are immoral C Homosexual acts are immoral Now as demonstrated above, WITHIN the Christian system, homosexual acts are indeed immoral. I think it is safe to assume that Con has a different view on morality, and I am very interested to know which system of ethics he subscribes to, whether it's that of Kant's, Bentham, Sarte, Aristotle, Nietzsche, a combination of 2 or more, or maybe someone else, and maybe even his own philosophy of ethics. It does not really matter what system of morality he will present, what matters and what is necessary is that the system is not arbitrary, and that the system is binding. For Con to refute the resolution, he can either: 1. Somehow show that homosexual acts are not immoral within the Christian system. 2. Provide an alternative moral standard that I and everyone else are necessarily bound to. In other words, a moral system in which I MUST accept that homosexual acts are not immoral. Con can also argue that absolute moral standards do not exist altogether, therefore, homosexual acts are not absolutely immoral, since there is no such thing as ""immorality"". In this case, we would just be arguing on who's personal OPINION is better, not unlike arguing which favorite color is better. In conclusion, the statement that ""homosexual acts are immoral"" presupposes a moral standard. I have provided a moral system that is absolute, universal unchanging, authoritative, and binding, and in which the resolution is supported. For Con or anyone to hold to the counter position, they must at the very least provide an absolute and binding moral standard that refutes that resolution. it would be irrational to debate about a moral issue while at the same time hold to the position of moral relatavism.",0,NewCreature,"

My hope is that this debate won't be taken merely as an intellectual competition or a battle of logic and argumentation, but instead a discussion on a very important topic. I'm not here to win points by technicalities, my goal is not even to win a debate (though I will be trying my best to do so). My goal here is to tackle this issue at its very foundation and hopefully provide a sound argument for my position, while simultaneously demonstrating that the counter position is not intellectually tenable.  I will be taking the Pro position in this debate and will be defending the resolution that ""homosexual acts are immoral"".   DEFINITIONS  I am in full agreement with Con in his definition of homosexual acts, ie ""Homosexual acts refer to consensual sex acts between two or more members of the same sex.""  Now the definition of the term ""immoral"" is where the debate really is. I appreciate Con's definition as well as his following statement that shows that he is aware that he and I will have differing views on what constitutes immorality. I hope the readers will take this important detail into account.  Now on to my argument..  This debate is not about whether or not homosexuality is a defect in nature, nor is this debate about whether homosexual acts should be legal or illegal. Those are different issues.   This debate is about whether or not homosexuality, or homosexual acts to be specific, are immoral. This is a debate about a moral or ethical issue. This is important to note because morality and ethics transcend what is legal and what is natural.  Though I chose to accept to defend the resolution that ""homosexual acts are immoral"", Con was the one who formulated this resolution. What I want to point out here is that Con and I both are presupposing a moral standard on which we can gauge what is immoral and therefore ground this debate. Con stated that ""For an action to be immoral means that it is contrary to right or to moral conduct."" This shows that Con will be arguing against the resolution on the basis of a moral standard.  Con did however state that him and I ""will no doubt have differing views on what constitute immorality"". I very much appreciated this statement of his and though I think this is where the debate will get tricky, I hope that Con and I will get somewhere with this during our debate.  ARGUMENT  Con was exactly right when he said that we will no doubt have differing views on what constitutes immorality so I will begin my argument by putting forward my view, which is the Biblical view on morality as interpreted by Reformed Protestantism.  God is absolute, with an unchanging moral character and is the standard of morality. Anything that is contrary to his absolute, unchanging character is therefore immoral. His commands and his word that he revealed through natural revelation and special revelation, ie. scripture, are expressions of his character and are therefore absolute, unchanging, and more importantly AUTHORITATIVE and binding.  P1 God and His word is the standard of morality  P2 The word of God teaches that homosexual acts are immoral  C Homosexual acts are immoral  Now as demonstrated above, WITHIN the Christian system, homosexual acts are indeed immoral.   I think it is safe to assume that Con has a different view on morality, and I am very interested to know which system of ethics he subscribes to, whether it's that of Kant's, Bentham, Sarte, Aristotle, Nietzsche, a combination of 2 or more, or maybe someone else, and maybe even his own philosophy of ethics. It does not really matter what system of morality he will present, what matters and what is necessary is that the system is not arbitrary, and that the system is binding.  For Con to refute the resolution, he can either:  1. Somehow show that homosexual acts are not immoral within the Christian system.  2. Provide an alternative moral standard that I and everyone else are necessarily bound to. In other words, a moral system in which I MUST accept that homosexual acts are not immoral.  Con can also argue that absolute moral standards do not exist altogether, therefore, homosexual acts are not absolutely immoral, since there is no such thing as ""immorality"". In this case, we would just be arguing on who's personal OPINION is better, not unlike arguing which favorite color is better.   In conclusion, the statement that ""homosexual acts are immoral"" presupposes a moral standard. I have provided a moral system that is absolute, universal unchanging, authoritative, and binding, and in which the resolution is supported. For Con or anyone to hold to the counter position, they must at the very least provide an absolute and binding moral standard that refutes that resolution. it would be irrational to debate about a moral issue while at the same time hold to the position of moral relatavism.",Philosophy,0,Homosexual-acts-are-immoral/3/,24412,0.06609056144952774
"During this round, there have been a lot of arguments presented, but now I would like to really break down why governments ought to have to right to regulate the media. Therefore, I have set up the following reasons of why you should vote for me in this round. 1. The resolution says ought to have the right. -Within this debate, you have to see is that all I have to prove is that the government OUGHT to have the right. There is nothing else that I have to prove, and I have proven that with all of the examples I have such as the when and where we attack another nation, the world ending, and the lack of leadership within a government. 2. My question in my last speech went unanswered. -In my last speech I asked my opponent to answer a very simple question. I asked that if we were planning to invade a nation and the media found out when and where, would you let them leak the information or would you regulate them? This question was quite simple, yet my opponent never replied to it. Also, don't let him ""kind of"" answer this within the next speech because I would then have no chance to reply. Basically, what you have to see is that OBVIOUSLY you would tell them not to report this because the effect of them reporting it (and having their freedom of the press) would be outweighed by the enemy getting this information (and losing their freedom to life). In other words, you HAVE to see that these regulations ARE for national security, something that is a little more important than freedom to the press. If you vote for me on anything, vote for that. 3. His big argument is only that governments have corruption. -Through out this round, his major argument has been that governments have too much corruption. For the following reason, don't buy this over my side... I. Media corruption is not as risky as the government regulations. -Sure, I admit that the government could go overboard with this regulation right, HOWEVER, the media will DEFINATLY go overboard with their right to report EVERYTHING they discover from the government. Its the same reason why there are five security levels in the government (which went unargued) and is similar to why they can't show pornography and swear on their reports. These regulation remove peoples right to the press, but yet these small regulations support the society's best interest, within this resolution, I am only extending that right to protect the most important thing we have, our national security. II. Even a corrupt government will protect national security with regulations. -What you have to see is that even the most corrupt government can be successful in protecting their nation, however, a nation without the right to regulate the media, then becomes incapable of doing this. Still though, a government would never be stupid enough not to keep certain things a secret, such as where and when we are invading a nation, or when the world will end. Which brings me to my final reason to vote for me. (This is simply a response to where he asked me to prove why the everything would crash if the world was to know of its doom date). 4. No one would want to do any more work if the world were to end. -I guess I assumed too much when I said that everything would crash. I assumed that if people were to know that they would be dead in 6 months, that they would stop going to school and work, and would only begin caring about number 1 , them self... and with no one working or AT LEAST not very many people working, there would be nothing to support anything. The economy as we know it would be gone and everyone would only become interested in their own interest which would mean the ""crashing of everything."" -In the end, you vote for all of the previous reasons. Also if you look to ALL of my examples, none of them are things that wouldn't be released in the media eventually. It just so happens that knowledge at the wrong time is when it is truly, deadly power. Therefore, certain information should be regulated at least until it is a more appropriate time. It would be ridiculous to say that the freedom of the press ought to be valued about national security in any manner. Therefore, you vote Pro. -Thank You for this GREAT round.

Before the recession its economy was booming growing at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities drastically improved.

The HDZ Verdict last March brings with it a major turning point for increasing transparency in Croatian government which is now becoming a big movement in that country. From what I have gathered from these sources is that Croatian politics, since the process of joining the EU, have been becoming increasingly less corrupt. Additionally, most of the corruption in Croatia most notably happen at the local level of government. Most of the national government corruption comes from their legislature's need to pass laws quickly so it is not corruption intended to be counterproductive for the nation.

"I just finished a debate on this topic, but I think it's an interesting topic, so I'm doing it again. The argument is quite simple: if God is morally perfect (or at least good), he must want there to be as little suffering as possible (based on the human definition of goodness). Since he is omnipotent, he has the tools to stop the suffering and since he is omniscient, he knows where the suffering is and the best way to stop it. But, when we look out into the world we see a ton of suffering. This either means that God doesn't exist or that he doesn't have the characteristics mentioned. Formalized, the argument is this: 1. If God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. 2. If God is omnipotent, then God has the power to eliminate all evil. 3. If God is omniscient, then God knows when evil exists. 4. If God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate all evil. 5. Evil exists. 6. If evil exists and God exists, then either God doesn't have the power to eliminate all evil, or doesn't know when evil exists, or doesn't have the desire to eliminate all evil. 7. Therefore, God doesn't exist. Here's an example of the kind of suffering I'm talking about: We as humans have physical brains which appear to be the cause of out minds. God however is a mind (he thinks for example) yet he does not have a brain to generate this mind. This indicates that non-physical minds are possible. Now, our physical minds are a source of immense suffering. They are extremely prone to injury, small chemical or neurological fluctuations can cause immense difficulties and before the advent of modern medical technology, the large heads of children caused the death of a large percentage of women in childbirth. There is no reason for these physical minds to exist - they are needless suffering. A morally perfect God would not create physical minds. There you go, hack away!",0,kvaughan,"

"I define stairs as ""one of a flight or series of steps for going from one level to another, as in a building"", and elevator as ""a moving platform or cage for carrying passengers or freight from one level to another, as in a building."" I negate the resolution ""Elevators are better then stairs."" My first contention is that stairs are safer. They are very sturdy and can withstand natural disasters like earthquakes and floods much better then elevators can. According to ELcosh.com, the 173 deaths related to work on or near elevators - about 14 per year - were most often caused by falls into elevator shafts. Stairs have no such dangers, and have no chance of not working, unlike elevators, which can't operate without electricity. Elevators cause 14 deaths a year on average, which is 14 innocent lives we'll never get back. My second contention is that stairs make people healthier. By walking up and down stairs instead of taking the easy way (the elevator), you are getting exercise, and helping build muscle in your legs. Many people that work in large office buildings (that generally have a lot of elevators) are sitting in a desk all day and need all the exercise they can get. So, since they help you get exercise, lose weight, and become a healthier, happier person, stairs are much better then elevators. My third contention is that stairs cost way less then elevators. The average elevator costs 25,000 dollars, not counting maintenance or inspection fees. The average cost of a flight of stairs is about 7500. This is a drastic difference, and all the extra money used for unnecessary elevators could be put to better use. Since stairs save lives, make people happier and healthier, and save money, they are much better then elevators. I look forward to an awesome debate, even though this is kind of a weird topic!

"Definitions: Attempted-Crime was intended by the perpetrator but did not fall through, such as ""attempted murder"". This debate concerns sentencing in the criminal law system not the civil law system. Saying to ""sentence"" them the same means that when the required or recommended sentence for a given crime is stated in law it should be stated the same for the ""attempted"" version of the crime. I do NOT mean ""same"" between individual cases. This proposal still allows judges to make what ever considerations in individual cases that they could before. However, as part of sentencing being the ""same"" any considerations that would be allowed to be made in sentencing for a crime would be allowed in both ""attempted"" and ""successful"" cases of it. Initial Argument Currently crimes are treated differently based on whether the perpetrator succeeds. Yet regardless of success the perpetrator has proven themselves to be just as much of a danger to society, and to have just as much criminal intent. There is no good reason to sentence failed criminals more leniently. There are 3 rational reasons for the state to use sentencing within the criminal law system: 1. Incapacitating offenders and protecting society 2. Deterence-Letting would-be offenders know what's coming to them if they commit the crime. 3. Rehabilitation-Reforming the character of the offender. Compare two identical scenarios, in one the murderer succeeded in another the murderer failed. In both cases there are no relevant considerations that justify being lenient against an offender just because their crime failed. A person who tried to commit a crime and failed shows just as much propensity to commit that crime as a person who succeeds at it. The former person was just not as lucky. 1. This makes both individuals just as dangerous to society, so there is equal reason to incapacitate both criminals. 2. Since we want to deter people from even trying the crime in the first place the same purpose of deterrence is fulfilled by equal sentencing. 3. Failing at a crime is not evidence that a person will take less time to rehabilitate or that they will be easier to rehabilitate. When the same reasons to the same extent as to why the state sentences would be the same for a given offense then it stands to reason and hence justice that the sentencing rules for the two crimes should be the same.",0,MasturDbtor,"

Why is it that we continue to try what isn't working. Which is why I must agree with... -Resolved- In the United States, minor jail time ought to be replaced with significant rehabilitation. This leads me to my value for this round... I. Value- Societal Welfare -Within this round, the only question is what provides a better solution for the society. What you have to see is that when we use rehabilitation over just a night in jail, they will commit crimes less often and if I can prove that, I will save tax money and the use of crimes therefore increasing societal welfare or the good of the society. In attempting to achieve this, there is only one way to achieve this within this resolution... II. Criterion- Appropriate Punishment -It is simple to make the connection of appropriate punishment as being significant rehabilitation. What you have to see is that when we get appropriate punishment, then societal welfare is right around the corner. The difference between Pro and Con in this resolution is simply the method of punishment. In most cases, a night in jail is not significant enough to stop from future misbehavior, but if you put them into rehab clinics, it is punishment and it does teach them why they should not act inappropriately in the future. III. Minor Jail time is not an appropriate punishment. A. Minor Jail time is not a great enough incentive to stop repeat offenders. -What you have to see is that while spending a day or two in prison is a slap on the wrist, it is not a great enough incentive to not try it again. In the end of due process, what the society truly wants is fewer crimes, not hard core punishment such as jail time would do. In other words, in order to truly support societal welfare, we must have appropriate punishment such as significant rehabilitation. B. Minor Jail time does not fit the crime committed. -While many people would insist on a day in prison being enough of a punishment for perhaps shoplifting or a DUI... it simply is not. When you were growing out, your parents would be more concerned that you learned your lesson rather than you being punished, but simply put, minor jail time does not fit any sort of crime big or small, it doesn't teach anything. IV. Significant rehabilitation is an appropriate punishment. A. Significant rehabilitation is a punishment for the common criminal. -What do you think is the last thing that a common criminal would want to happen after being caught doing a crime? Being talked to about it of course! If there is ever an incentive to not commit a crime, it isn't a bad meal on a stiff bed (such would be the case of minor jail time) but it would be 20 hours of talking to awkward councilors instead. Therefore, significant rehab has all the benefits of minor jail time. B. Significant rehabilitation gives a chance for the common criminal to be a regular citizen again. -The final and most important argument in my case is simply that rehab does give a chance for the common criminal to finally be a good citizen (thus supporting societal welfare). It may even be the first time in these peoples lives that they actually understand why you do or do not do certain things. What you have to see is that even if I prove that one more person is saved by my significant rehabilitation, and then I prove that fewer of the costs will appear. -In the end- The appropriate punishment at the end of this case and round simply has to be significant rehabilitation. It offers few of the costs (IV B) and all of the benefits (IV A). It offers a chance for common criminals to become common citizens thus increasing the societal welfare and overall increasing general moral goals and standards.

Homosexuals have been around since the 13th century, but it was not aloud to be seen. Between 408 B.C.E to 400 B.C.E the famous ancient greek philosopher. From his publication of The Symposium, it showed acts of homosexuality. Plato expresses to ""celebrate"" the relationship between man and man. Even plato quotes that the symposium is a ""manual"" to homosexuality ""The Symposium might be described as a manual for those embarking on the homoerotic-spiritual path"" (Plato 268). Plato was said to be gay but it was never a proven fact. Homosexuals all around us make the world just like us. They are great people who open doors for others. For example Roberta Achtenberg she was the first openly gay-lesbian offical for the United States. She was a civil rights leader/attorney. She recieved alot of awards. For example she won in 1997 one of the ""50 Most Influential Businesswomen in the Bay Area""-bay area meaning san fransico bay area. Also in 1994 she won GLAAD Media Awards, Visibility Award. ALSO she was a founder for ""the national center for lesiban rights"" and was also awarded for that as well. She became a successful writer as well about sexual orientation. She being a successful gay/lesbian how is that destroying america? Shes actually helping america by educating others about how it is okay to be gay. There are obstacles in life that you can over come. As long as your content with yourself thats what should matter. Unfortunately society is a cruel thing that we face everyday.

"I shall address my opponent's rebuttals whilst reinforcing my own arguments: My opponent gives an example of how PR can only be applied to a Congressional or Parliamentary system, and not a Presidential election. This could have been a very good, strong argument, if it weren't for the fact that there is no justification for the statement. The Geography of Politics Further, my opponent seems to claim that the problem for the Lib Dems is their geography. However, the real problem is that they come second in a lot of constituencies. The Lib Dem party consistently come second, and there is consistently someone gets elected on a minority of votes. In Bromley and Chislehurst, Camborne and Redruth, Cambridge and Bournemouth East[1], the Lib Dems consistently come second. And this is something that happens in hundreds of consituencies. Probably the worst story is that of Lib Dem representative Julia Goldsworthy. In Camborne and Redruth, she gained15,903 votes, but came second to Conservative representative George Eustice, who gained 15,969 votes. This means that almost 16,000 voters for the Lib Dem party are not represented. Add in Labour's unrepresented 7,000 and UKIP's 2,100 and you have around 25,000 voters not being fairly represented, contrasting the 15,000 who are: a blatantly unrepresentative, undemocratic system. If STV was in place, a version of PR, then multi-member consituencies would come to exist, and drastically reduce the number of wasted votes in Parliamentary Voting and Constituencies Act 2011.[2] This could be used in conjunction with PR to make the seats balanced. However, the only way for a constituency border system to be so imbalanced as my opponent suggests is if the setting of the borders was intentionally unfair, and therefore both voting systems would be equally superficial. Further, PR would solve the problem of the Lib Dems coming second by giving them seats as per the number of votes they get, even if they come second, to let them be fairly represented. To allow the voter to be represented by someone they voted for. Finally, in regards to these hypotheticals about geography, borders are constantly adjusted to keep the population of a constituency roughly similar to other areas. For example, the borders of constituencies in Britain were changed last year to accomodate for any changes[5]. Moreover, the largest constituency is 110,000 (second largest 90,000) and the smallest 55,000[3], so the geographical advantage is a moot point. Only 9 out of the 650 constituencies are outside the range of 60,000 to 90,000 seats. However, in this situation, STV would still be better! As it is multi-constituency, each seat is worth the same number of votes. So in the third constituency, the seat shall only be worth two or three seats (if that), while the largest worth a hundred seats, meaning more representation to take into account that it is a larger constituency. Plurality systems would actually make it worse as it would mean that you're vote's value depends on your constituency. This is another problem with plurality votes, as you're geography seriously affects your vote's value. If you live in a place such as Witney, where over 60% of the votes consistently go to Conservative, also known as a 'safe' seat, then your vote has no value there: you cannot get your party or politician in to represent you. However, if you are in Camborne and Redruth, where the votes are really close, your vote is valuable beyond belief: your vote can actually affect who gets a seat in Parliament, and therefore how the country is run. This geographical discrimination disappears under STV, because each constituency holds seats dependant on the number of votes there are. This is known as Gerrymandering. These diagrams represent how gerrymandering works: the diagram on the left represents 4 ungerrymandered constituencies, each with 50% of the voters Red and 50% Blue. The one on the right represents 4 gerrymandered constituencies. This leads to the blue winning 3 seats, and red winning 1, so the blue voters win, even though they got the shared number of votes. in fact, there could be no blues in the bottom-left constituency, and blue would still win, while red would lose. This is incredibly easy in plurality, but in PR, which holds multiple MP constituencies, the reds would be represented fairer, making the system much fairer. This is a turn on the geographical aspect. So, to conclude on that point, the PR promotes democracy substantially more than plurality systems. Before moving to new arguments, I want to point out arguments conceded: STV allows the vote value of each seat to become more balanced, and the plurality system unfairly unbalances them. STV allows one to vote for a candidate inside one's party, and is therefore preferable in a Parliamentary system. STV allows other parties and ideas to access the political stage with more ease, and allows other parties to form. STV makes tactical voting unnecessary Plurality promotes political apathy and atrophy With this in mind, I await my opponent's rebuttal. 1 - <URL>... (UK_Parliament_constituency) <URL>...

"You should debate me. I will show why you are holding onto the remnants of a patriarchal past - an era of grave intolerance and discrimination. I will not ""prove"" that women are better, to do such would defeat the idea of equality. But to think that the woman who held you in her womb for 9 months somehow birthed a child who had inherently more right to have, do, and pursue the things of the world than she, is pointblank preposterous . What is it in you that says, ""because the dice rolled X and Y, I have more rights as a guy?"" Also, with are Judeo-Christian roots as a western civilization, and since 82% of the US population consider themselves Christian(1), what would the Bible say about unequal rights? Galations 3:28 ""For there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male or female, for all are one is Christ Jesus.""

You should debate me.  
I will show why you are holding onto the remnants of a patriarchal past - an era of grave intolerance and discrimination. I will not ""prove"" that women are better, to do such would defeat the idea of equality. But to think that the woman who held you in her womb for 9 months somehow birthed a child who had inherently more right to have, do, and pursue the things of the world than she, is pointblank preposterous . What is it in you that says, ""because the dice rolled X and Y, I have more rights as a guy?""  
  
Also, with are Judeo-Christian roots as a western civilization, and since 82% of the US population consider themselves Christian(1), what would the Bible say about unequal rights? Galations 3:28 ""For there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male or female, for all are one is Christ Jesus.""

"First off I would like to note that my first statement was NOT an argument. So you can't call it ""weak without support"" when it wasn't an argument in the first place. Now without furder ado, I will present my arguments for why Pluto should be a planet. 1. Pluto has many characteristics of a planet Unlike small asteroids and comets, pluto has many planet characteristics. Pluto is far from a boring and dead ball of ice, for example, Pluto is large enough to be round. Nearly all asteroids and comets are irregularly shaped but Planets are large enough to have a gravity force strong enough to crush it into a spherical shape. Pluto's gravity is plenty strong to crush it into a sphere. Every other planet in the Solar System is a sphere due to their gravity. Like many planets, pluto also has moons. In fact, pluto has five moons, more than any other terresetrial planets. Pluto also has an atmosphere unlike Mercury. Pluto was discovered to have an atmosphere made of nitrogen with trace amounts of other gasses. Scientists believe Pluto's atmosphere may also have clouds and winds. While pluto may be small, it has characteristics making it a world of it's own. 2. Missing information from the Solar System By classifying pluto is ""not a planet,"" we are teaching people that there are only 8 planets. There are worlds past Neptune with Pluto being one of them. By saying pluto isn't a planet, it's like we are giving the image of a limited Solar System with only 8 planets. There are other worlds which we should not dis-include from the solar system. While there are many ""planets"" in the Kuiper Belt, we can just give these 'planets' another classification of planets instead of counting these as not being planets. If we are to teach in schools about the planets in the solar system, we should just show around 12 planets or so and mention that it's a simplified version of the solar system. This way, we would give the idea that there are many worlds in the Kuiper belt and not give the idea of there being 8 planets or whatever. 3. Does size really matter? Imagine going to a city, there are many buildings. However, there are a few large buildings that outstand all the other buildings. Does this mean we should only say the large buildings are buildings and say that the smaller ones are not buildings? By this logic, we would imply there being 10 buildings in a city when there are many others. Those smaller buildings have the same characteristics of the larger ones, they are just smaller. Also, there are very small stars that exist. Yet we still consider these as stars and not ""dwarf stars."" This goes the same with Pluto. Pluto has characteristics of a planet and it is a world of it's own, not just some small comet orbiting around the sun. Sources <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... <URL>... Conclusion Pluto has many characteristics of a planet and it is large enough to be a sphere.

"Resolved: That the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 will successfully mitigate economic slowdowns over the next year. Definitions: Successfully- Achieving the desired effect Mitigate- decrease Year- 2009 Contention 1: Money into economy Whereas the Economic Stimulus Act is giving roughly $106 billion dollars to citizens that qualify, spending will increase within the nation. When this occurs companies are able to profit in turn mitigating the current recession. The recession is caused by citizens who're incapable due to debt (for the most part) from purchasing goods. As companies suffer due to loss in profit due to lack of buying, the economy suffers. Contention 2: Federal Reserve A)Money and Rates: The Federal Reserve had injected $24 billion into the U.S. banking system and lowered the federal funds rate below the usual target rate of 5.25% to help stabilize the economy, August 9, 2007. Since then, the rates of the Federal funds rate have been reduced to its current level of 4.25%. Basically this means in addition to the economic stimulus alone, the Fed. Reserve is working with the banks of the U.S. to help lower the amount that banks are charged when they make an overnight loan to one another. This helps the economy by taking less money away from the banks, allowing it to fuel the economy, and at the same time giving direct funding to the economy in banks. This helps mitigate the economic recession. B)Foreign and Central Banks Through actions between the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks such as the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank, the Federal Reserve was able to alleviate some funding pressures by making greater liquidity (ability or ease to convert assets into cash) available. Lines were established between the ECB and the Federal Reserve to swap currency, which funds non-U.S. institutions that would usually go to the interbank market as opposed to the U.S. Through liquidity provided from the ECB's short-term funding of about $500 billion, markets have been able to recover on an international level. Essentially U.S is working with foreign banks to circulate money, helping to raise the value. Pressures on the economy are being alleviated through the liquidity of the Federal Reserve. Also, through the ECB's funding in the interbank, some markets are able to recover. Contention 3: Hirer wages Higher wages are an easy way to increase economic activity in the sense that it increases the amount people are able to spend on U.S markets. Now it's easy to say that there are no guarantees that the money will be spent on personal ventures, but the fact of the matter is that many Americans are in over their heads in debt, and this hurts companies when these citizens aren't able to pay. This increased wage can easily help to pay back loans, and debts acquired through the years and this directly influences the economy. This may look like a costly method, but it is effective and will essentially benefit companies in general, and perhaps save this nation from facing a great economic recession.",0,bigbass3000,"

This may look like a costly method, but it is effective and will essentially benefit companies in general, and perhaps save this nation from facing a great economic recession.",Politics,0,POFO-april-Topic-POFOers-only-please./1/,40532,0.0020660972222685814

"In this debate will will consider this resolution in the situations of countries, domestic violence, and situations involving parents. 1. Following this philosophy will create unnecessary war. Lets really take the time to think about this. If south Korea was attacked by the united states following this resolution then south Korea should attack back. We all know that south Korea would get wiped off the map. Most likely if his was to happen in real life Korea would not follow the philosophy of this resolution. Why? because it will create a war that south Korea could not win. So we cannot say that all nations should attack the attacker if they get attacked. Countries need to take in to consideration if they can win first. Going to war without first strategizing is fatal. So if countries followed this ideal then we would still be fighting each other impulsively like in the past. North Korea has ""Hit"" south Korea numerous times. But should the south hit the north back? The north could easily take the south. Witch is why they shouldn't hit them back. So following this resolution if we follow this resolution if a states followed this ideal then wars and extinctions that could have been avoided would be inevitable. If an ally hit us should we hit them back? No we need to talk to them and find out why first. Maybe it was an accident. If we just rush in and declare war I would have all been for nothing. 2. Domestic violence So if I being a man is hit by a woman should I then hit her back? Absolutely not. I should be the bigger person and walk away. I could bruise a woman much easier than she could bruise me. Neither parties shouldn't put their hand on each other especially if there in a relationship. If a couple truly loves each other , then neither should have the intention of inflicting harm to one another. Lets rewind time for this situation and say Hitler was gay and was dating a Jew.( just stay with me here) if Hitler hit the guy should that guy hit him back? absolutely not. He would have been gased or shot immediently. 3. Parental situations So, lets say you live in the ghetto and you stole 50 dollars of your moms money. At the time your 10 years old and 70 pounds. Mom on the other hand is about 160 and is a female bodybuilder. She hits you. Should you hit her back? You just stole her last bit of money to pay the light bill. Why should you hit her back? Are you justified in hitting her back even though you didnt consider the repercussions of your actions? Say were at grandmas and she hits you just because. Should you hit her back? As we know old people are fragile. Following this resolution then we should hit grandma. Though we didnt mean to you hitting her caused her to have a heart attack. because you follow the philosophy of this resolution, because you hit me that justifies that I should hit you back. absolutely not. Though in some cases if someone hits you, you are justified in defending yourself witch could include running, not in all cases should you hit the attacker back. In order for pro to solidly prove the success of this resolution He/she needs to prove that this resolution is justifiable in every situation and not just one situation. Thus all of my points needs to be successfully countered. I personally see no justification for the point presented by the con of this debate witch solidifies the fact that this resolution needs to be rejected for the sake of thinking before one acts.

"My opponent is basing almost the entirety of his argument off of pretty much one verse: 2 Thessalonians 2:3. I feel like using the Douay-Rheims version, so I'll requote the verse for no reason. ""(3) Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,"" - 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3 My opponent misinterprets this verse badly by adding his own personal views to it, which I myself am about to do as well. For starters, it never says every single person will be lost, just that there will be a revolt (or falling away). It never says the revolt will be universal, and as long as the revolt isn't universal, the Church will persist. It also fails to say that the Church would be restored, because it never says that the Church will be lost. Compare with this: "" And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. "" - Matthew 16:18 My opponent's claims would make Jesus a liar, as he says that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church. If the entire Church was wrecked to the degree that it would have to be reformed, the gates of Hell certainly prevailed. "" But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. "" - 1 Timothy 3:15 The Church is the pillar and ground of the truth. It does not seem likely that a pillar Jesus promised would not be destroyed would collapse. "" But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you."" - John 16:13 In my opponent's view, either the Holy Spirit never came (in which case the Bible is completely wrong), or it came and bungled the job so badly that the Church collapsed anyway. If the Holy Spirit was present, it seems unlikely that it would teach all truth by letting every last person apostatize. Very counterproductive. "" To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus unto all generations, world without end. Amen."" - Ephesians 3:21 The LDS Church has not existed for all generations. My opponent's theory, in a nutshell, was that Christ promised the Church would not be overcome, the Church was quickly overcome anyway, and Christ was like ""Oh, no biggie. I'll get around to fixing it soon. And by soon, I mean in 1800 years."" Having disproven the possibility of total apostasy, it is trivial to demonstrate that the Catholic Church is preferrable. The Catholic Church is one of only two bodies with claim to valid Apostolic succession, and the Catholic Church can trace itself back to St. Peter, who was himself appointed by Christ. Here is a list [1], going all the way back to Peter. Pro writes "" I will be able to follow my priesthood line of succession through Jesus Christ himself."", however he fails to show how this is the case in any way. Catholic priests can trace their succession through 2000 years back to Jesus; my opponent cannot say the same. Additionally, the LDS Church uses the 'Book of Mormon', in defiance of the Bible. ""But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema."" - Galatians 1:8 Since I have some free space, I might as well address my opponent's opening statement. I find it humorous that my opponent writes "" I disagree with this because the idea that a random Italian group can say that this one man can speak to god is outrageous."", because he's more aptly describing the LDS Church than the Catholic Church. The Pope doesn't have God's phone number, and is only protected from teaching doctrinal error, nothing more. On the other hand, the LDS Church believes it has a prophet [2]. Also, compare the LDS twelve apotles [3] to a sample of the Cardinals of the Catholic Church [4]. Note that the prophet is in defiance of 1 Corinthians 13:9-10, which says that prophecy will be done away with. ""(9) For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. (10) But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away."" Pro writes "" In history do they ever talk about who founded the Catholic Church, it just sort of showed up.""

"I'd first like to thank Pro for offering up his interesting case. I will agree with him on his important differentiation between morality and nature/law. However, Pro also makes many mistakes in his case, namely the supposed presupposition of a moral standard on my part and his faulty conception of the consequences of rejecting an absolute moral standard. These fallacious points of reasoning in conjunction with the subsequent lack of warrant regarding Pro's theistic claims will show that there is no reason to accept the Pro case. Praxeological Analysis. The reason I think Pro made the mistake of thinking that I have to bring a rival moral theory in order to deconstruct his own is because he does not see a way for moral theories to be criticized in any other way. Pro seems to rely on the conception of morality as not criticisable by any rational means. This is not the case. Ethical goals need not be only criticized from the perspective of other ethical goals. Another non-moral standard on which to judge these goals and judgements is by praxeological critique. A praxeological critique refers to a value-free analysis of a moral assertion. Murray Rothbard explains: ""And yet praxeology may be extended beyond its current sphere, to criticize ethical goals. This does not mean that we abandon the value neutrality of praxeological science. It means merely that even ethical goals must be framed meaningfully and, therefore, that praxeology can criticize (1) existential errors made in the formulation of ethical propositions and (2) the possible existential meaninglessness and inner inconsistency of the goals themselves. If an ethical goal can be shown to be self-contradictory and conceptually impossible of fulfillment, then the goal is clearly an absurd one and should be abandoned by all. [...] we are not here attempting to establish a positive ethical system of our own or even to prove that such a system is attainable. We believe only that praxeology should have the right of veto, to discard any ethical propositions that fail to meet the test of conceptual possibility or internal consistency."" [1] As Con to the resolution my purpose and goal within this debate is to show that whatever reasons Pro brings for the alleged immorality of homosexual acts is incorrect. This does not mean that I must supplant his moral theory with my own, that is unnecessary to show his theory to be faulty. I need only to show why Pro's own moral theory either rests on an existential error in its formulation or it is itself internally inconsistent. If this can be shown then there would be no reason to accept Pro's standard and this would be enough to oppose any such theory. This point also refutes Pro's assertion that to not argue from an absolute moral standard would be to give up objectivity in this debate. On the contrary, I can still show his own morality to be false via value-free reasoning. ===Deconstruction of Pro's Case=== The most serious problem with the Pro case is that Pro has completely failed to provide warrant as to the existence of the God. The relevance is that God is itself supposedly the entire grounding of moral normativity. Seeing as P1 implies the actual existence of such a God (I will assume for argument's sake that Pro did not base his ethical argument off the edicts of a fictional character for now), warrant is obviously necessary in order to corroborate his claim. If there's no valid reason to think that God exists then there is subsequently no valid reason to think that Pro's argument is sound. And since Pro has failed to provide an argument in favor of the existence of the Christian God AS WELL AS proof that God himself has made such an edict (even if God is shown to exist a separate line of reasoning is necessary to show that the Christian holy books were actually inspired by him), there is no valid reason to believe Pro's claim. ===Sources=== [1] Murray Rothbard.

"Bain Capital is company that focuses on leveraged buyouts, not venture capital investments. Venture Capitalism Good, Leveraged Buyouts Bad Venture capitalism is a method by which money holders purchase an interest in a startup company by investing seed money in the company. It is a high risk investment with potentially high rewards. Since the majority of failures of new startups is caused by undercapitalization, this is a very important part of growing the economy. Without it we may never have seen the technological booms of the 1980's and 1990's.[1] Bain Capital was brilliant in that it moved away from startups before the tech bust and focused on leveraged buyouts rather than capital investments.[2] Leveraged buyouts, on the other hand, are not for the good of the company. Leveraged buyouts look for companies that are stable, have a low existing debt load, have generated a steady supply of revenue, have hard assets, and have the potential for short term increases in the bottom line through things like workforce layoffs or job eliminations[3]. The money that is used to gain a controlling interest in the company is often borrowed, and secured by the hard assets of the very company that is being invaded.[3] Worse yet, the debt is non-recourse, meaning that the company being raided is responsible for paying off the debt. It is not unheard of for the companies debt to also be used to pay dividends to the raiders [4] Raided Companies Left in Weakened State Shackled with this debt, many companies find themselves in a weakened position. According to the Washington Post, 22% of the companies in which Bain invested fell into bankruptcy[5] within eight years of being raided. Because of the way Bain would restructure the companies finance (to benefit Bain, not the company), the company could not fulfill its obligations. The company raided Armco Steel in my hometown in 1993. Armco Steel had been operating since 1888 and at its peak employed 4,500 people. Bain took a dividend payout of $36.1 million dollars, at the same time their pension plan was under funded by $44 million. Armco Steel went bankrupt less than a decade after Bain arrived and because of the way leveraged buyouts are funded, Bain did not have to pay for the union pensions to which they helped themselves. Instead, the union had to be bailed out by the government, but only at a fraction of the original pension payout to the members. Just Because Something Survives Does Not Mean It Was Helped Many years ago leeching was an acceptable form of therapy for most illnesses. Though some patients inevitably survived this bloodletting, many others died. We know now that it was not 'bad blood' that was being drained, just blood; blood that the patient needed to survive. Though my esteemed opponent can certainly point to companies which survived long enough to thrive after being taken over by Bain, there are many other companies besides Armco Steel that had the opposite result. From the New York Post[6]: Bain in 1988 put $5 million down to buy Stage Stores, and in the mid-'90s took it public, collecting $100 million from stock offerings. Stage filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Bain in 1992 bought American Pad & Paper (AMPAD), investing $5 million, and collected $100 million from dividends. The business filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Bain in 1993 invested $60 million when buying GS Industries, and received $65 million from dividends. GS filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Bain in 1997 invested $46 million when buying Details, and made $93 million from stock offerings. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2003. The only positive net effect resulting from Bain involvement is their profit margin. The lives and jobs of the thousands of people that have been negatively affected by the liquidation of 'assets' in order to turn a quick profit were added to the rolls of the unemployed and the empty factories stand as a testamant to the cruelty of the bloodletting.

The company raided Armco Steel in my hometown in 1993. Armco Steel had been operating since 1888 and at its peak employed 4,500 people. Bain took a dividend payout of $36.1 million dollars, at the same time their pension plan was under funded by $44 million. Armco Steel went bankrupt less than a decade after Bain arrived and because of the way leveraged buyouts are funded, Bain did not have to pay for the union pensions to which they helped themselves. Instead, the union had to be bailed out by the government, but only at a fraction of the original pension payout to the members.  Just Because Something Survives Does Not Mean It Was Helped  Many years ago leeching was an acceptable form of therapy for most illnesses. Though some patients inevitably survived this bloodletting, many others died. We know now that it was not 'bad blood' that was being drained, just blood; blood that the patient needed to survive. Though my esteemed opponent can certainly point to companies which survived long enough to thrive after being taken over by Bain, there are many other companies besides Armco Steel that had the opposite result.  From the New York Post[6]:  
  
  Bain in 1988 put $5 million down to buy Stage Stores, and in the mid-'90s took it public, collecting $100 million from stock offerings. Stage filed for bankruptcy in 2000.  
  
  
  Bain in 1992 bought American Pad & Paper (AMPAD), investing $5 million, and collected $100 million from dividends. The business filed for bankruptcy in 2000.  
  
  
  Bain in 1993 invested $60 million when buying GS Industries, and received $65 million from dividends. GS filed for bankruptcy in 2001.  
  
  
  Bain in 1997 invested $46 million when buying Details, and made $93 million from stock offerings. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2003.  
  
  The only positive net effect resulting from Bain involvement is their profit margin.  The lives and jobs of the thousands of people that have been negatively affected by the liquidation of 'assets' in order to turn a quick profit were added to the rolls of the unemployed and the empty factories stand as a testamant to the cruelty of the bloodletting.

"""This is based on the flawed assumption that general relativity is applicable by itself during all periods of time going back to pre-Planck Time."" Well, anything prior to the singularity is an assumption, particularly how everything comes from nothing. But I digress. For this debate I intend on a two-pronged approach that places emphasis on empirical observation and philosophy to show that time indeed could be mathematically categorized as T=0. With that brief introduction, lets get started. First and foremost, anything that exists only exists because of a cause. What do I mean? Something that exists only exists as the result of something else -- cause and effect. And the cause of somethings existence is always outside of itself, meaning, nothing has ever been demonstrably shown to have existed without a cause facilitating its existence. For instance, your birth was not the cause of your own doings. Rather, you exist because two people, along with the laws of nature, have allowed for your procreation. These are immutable laws of physics that have never been shown to be usurped. I naturally would defy PRO to prove otherwise in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I do not intend to use a logical fallacy, such as an argument of consensus, however, these theories reach beyond the theoretical stage for countless astrophysicists, mathematicians, and cosmologists. It therefore lends itself to more than mere credence and ends up being self-evident truths about life and the universe in which life itself is contained therein. Secondly, since time and space are essentially homologous, as in ""space-time,"" one cannot exist without the other. This seems fairly axiomatic without introducing lengthy theorems to prove it, because if something exists, when did it exist, and where did it exist? Obviously one cannot do without the other. For instance, when two events are separated by timed intervals, enough time passes between them for there to be a cause/effect relationship between the two events. For a particle traveling less than the speed of light, any two events which occur to or by the particle must be separated by these intervals -- hence, time, space, and matter being distinguishable from one another, however, they are not separate entities for they need each other in order to exist. Its that triune nature of physics that allow for life. Now, consider that there was no singularity, no point in which time began. Would time itself then become timeless? Surely not just on a philosophical level, because time outside of space means nothing, and indeed, could not exist in actuality-- never mind conceptually. Time, I think you would agree, are not merely contrivances of the human mind. Sure, humans have assigned intervals to time for our own benefit, but time in fact is a very real phenomenon regardless of how we divvy it up for our own convenience. Lastly, empirical evidence in the form of Hubble's redshift strongly imply that when the universe began, time itself began. Obviously you see it differently, and I'm intrigued as to how you intend on proving otherwise. But what happened before Planck's Time (10-43 seconds after the universe began) no one knows empirically. However, fundamental forces such as gravity begin to differentiate between other laws. And if we were to go backwards in the time-line, we see that the universe began at T=0. If for no other reason, time cannot be infinite for the sole fact that space was not infinite, nor is there not infinite mass. This more than amply implies that time had a beginning, and tracing it back, we see the singularity. I am, however, very interested in your argument. As a caveat, I would suggest that it be readable for to the average layman. Swamping them down with mathematical theorems will be useless for all parties involved.

To say ""something cannot come from nothing"" is to put a restriction on ""nothing"". However, there is no reason why ""nothing"" must adhere to any restrictions. There is no garantee that any restrictions can exist if ""nothing"" does, because if ""nothing"" exists, then neither do ""restrictions"".   For these reasons, I think it's clear that the claim ""something cannot come from nothing"" is not sufficiently supported.

"Socrates was right when he said, definition aids to better argument and understanding. Welfare: according to oxford advanced learnmers dictionary edition 8,it defined welfare as money that government pays regularly to people who are poor,unemployed,sick e.t.c and according to free online dictionary, it defined it as practical or financial help that is provided, often by governmment, for people that need it. Hardwork: putting effort on job or something. Based on this definition, my premise is stated thus: since most of this money goes to the poor, sick, unemployed, children e.t.c, and this are problems which the government need to solve, then welfare will even encourage hardwork. Do we know that if one is been compensated or given quota for the work done, that it will encourage the person? Now for the unemployed, they are starving. The government ought to provide industries and other social amenities that will help them and since this is not available in some country like Nigeria,Ghana,ethiopia,e.t.c then this welfare will even support the poor.

Can you look that hungry child in the eyes? See the blood on his feet from working barefoot in the cotton fields. Or do you ask his baby sister with her belly swollen from hunger if she cares about her daddy's work ethics? This is a practical example of what am saying.

The government ought to provide industries and other social amenities that will help them and since this is not available in some country like Nigeria,Ghana,ethiopia,e.t.c then this welfare will even support the poor.  
A brilliant young woman in u.s.a was asked to support her argument in favour of social welfare, she named the most reliable source ever imagined:the look in a mother's face when she cannot feed her children. Can you look that hungry child in the eyes? See the blood on his feet from working barefoot in the cotton fields. Or do you ask his baby sister with her belly swollen from hunger if she cares about her daddy's work ethics? This is a practical example of what am saying. Most of this welfare goes to the poor,children and unemployed.the president of America barack obama stated on cnn.com that welfare even encourage hardwork. Having given this argument, I await my opponent's reply.",Economics,1,Welfare-discourages-hardwork/1/,71404,0.006842717994004488
Round 1 is acceptance only. This argument regards the United States republican party only. Pro-gay rights is defined as being officially in favor of legal homosexual marriage. This argument is to be largely based on logic and reason but any relevant facts are encouraged. No new arguments may be brought up during the third and fourth rounds. No arguments based on religion or faith may be brought up. All arguments should focus on the moral benefits/negatives and the political benefits/negatives of taking a pro-gay stance.

"Thank you for your swift response. I shall point out that my opponent violated the structure of the debate. Round 2 is opening statements and round 3 was to begin rebuttals. I. Evidential Arguments A. Problem of Evil My opponent's attempt at refuting the problem of evil is a strawman. [1.1A] confusion of two kinds of beginning and causation My opponent's argument is a strawman. If you were to birth a child that will grow up to be someone like Adolf Hitler, you may have caused it, though you are not morally responsible. However, if you were able to prevent the murder, then you would be morally responsible for it. If God is able to prevent evil, but not willing, then he is malevolent. [1.2A] negation of evil in the grand scheme My opponent acknowledged the existence of pointless and horrendous evil. However, he states that it's nothing because it will all be eliminated in the next world. I say that it would not be redundant to prevent evil because it assumes that the ultimate end of evil is good. For example, imagine that a doctor amputates a patient's leg, an ""evil"", in order to prevent gangrene from spreading throughout the patient's body, ""the ultimate end"", which is ""good."" Yet this example fails because the doctor is limited; unlike God who is unlimitted. A better example would be the same doctor having the same paitent having a cure for the gangrene without having to amputate it, decides do amputate it anyway. We would call such a doctor ""mad"", why should we then call ""God"" ""good""? [1] B. The Argument from Demographics [2A] What incentive for Caring? My opponent is correct in regards that we are not referring to a specific deity. If God were all-loving, then he would have a desire to have a relationship with the whole of mankind. So, we come with this syllogism: Premise 1: If God were to exist, then he would desire a relationship with all of mankind. Premise 2: However, God does not have a relationship with the whole of mankind Conclusion: Therefore, it is probable that God does not exist. So, the incentive for caring is that God, if omnibenevolent, would desire a relationship with the whole of mankind. In order to have a relationship with the whole of mankind, he needs to have revealed himself in such a way to be able to have that relationship he desires. Sidebar note (this point is irrelavent as it is from a specific religion): This is exactly what Christianity teaches: God desires a relationship with mankind. [2] [2A] Incidental and Irrelavent See above. II. Evidential Arguments A. Incoherence of God [3.1A] Partial Incomprehensibility My opponent fails to understand the gist of the argument. He claims that there is no common concensus on the conception of God. My opponent is correct (and this can be used as another argument in favour of atheism, not going to go into detail here). This, however, does not address the argument. I defined God as a diety that has the specific attributes of the Judeo-Christian God. [3.2A] Omniscience does not include knowledge of future My opponent claims that God does not know the future. However, this goes against the definition of omniscience. Omniscience is the quality of having all knowledge [3]. Consequently, God knows all things possible and actual.

  Thank you for your swift response. I shall point out that my opponent violated the structure of the debate. Round 2 is opening statements and round 3 was to begin rebuttals.   I. Evidential Arguments  A. Problem of Evil  My opponent's attempt at refuting the problem of evil is a strawman.   [1.1A] confusion of two kinds of beginning and causation   My opponent's argument is a strawman. If you were to birth a child that will grow up to be someone like Adolf Hitler, you may have caused it, though you are not morally responsible. However, if you were able to   prevent   the murder, then you would be morally responsible for it. If God is able to prevent evil, but not willing, then he is malevolent.   [1.2A] negation of evil in the grand scheme   My opponent acknowledged the existence of pointless and horrendous evil. However, he states that it's nothing because it will all be eliminated in the next world. I say that it would not be redundant to prevent evil because it assumes that the ultimate end of evil is good. For example, imagine that a doctor amputates a patient's leg, an ""evil"", in order to prevent gangrene from spreading throughout the patient's body, ""the ultimate end"", which is ""good."" Yet this example fails because the doctor is limited; unlike God who is unlimitted. A better example would be the same doctor having the same paitent having a cure for the gangrene without having to amputate it, decides do amputate it anyway. We would call such a doctor ""mad"", why should we then call ""God"" ""good""? [1]  B. The Argument from Demographics   [2A] What incentive for Caring?  My opponent is correct in regards that we are not referring to a specific deity. If God were all-loving, then he would have a desire to have a relationship with the whole of mankind. So, we come with this syllogism:  Premise 1: If God were to exist, then he would desire a relationship with all of mankind.  Premise 2: However, God does not have a relationship with the whole of mankind  Conclusion: Therefore, it is probable that God does not exist.   
     
  So, the incentive for caring is that God, if omnibenevolent, would desire a relationship with the whole of mankind. In order to have a relationship with the whole of mankind, he needs to have revealed himself in such a way to be able to have that relationship he desires.   Sidebar note (this point is irrelavent as it is from a specific religion): This is exactly what Christianity teaches: God desires a relationship with mankind. [2]   [2A] Incidental and Irrelavent  See above.   II. Evidential Arguments  A. Incoherence of God  [3.1A] Partial Incomprehensibility  My opponent fails to understand the gist of the argument. He claims that there is no common concensus on the conception of God. My opponent is correct (and this can be used as another argument in favour of atheism, not going to go into detail here). This, however, does not address the argument. I defined God as a diety that has the specific attributes of the Judeo-Christian God.   [3.2A] Omniscience does not include knowledge of future   My opponent claims that God does not know the future. However, this goes against the definition of omniscience. Omniscience is the quality of having all knowledge [3]. Consequently, God knows all things possible and actual. In standard theology, God ordained whatever will come to pass according to his well (Eph. 1:11).  Premise 1: If God knows everything, it follows that he knows the future (indeed, if you don't know the future, you don't know everything)  Premise 2: God knows everything (by definition of omniscient);  Conclusion: God knows the future.  III. Refuting my opponent's arguments for God's Existence  A. Modal Cosmological Argument  I will respond to this argument in the next round due to time constraints and debate structure.   B. Argument from Beauty   I do not see how the fact that we can understand beauty means that there is a God. It simply does not follow. By contrast, the Neanderthals, although not human, did seem to have an understanding of art and music. [4 and 5]   ______________________________________________________________________________  1.

"Alright you have brought up many major points. The thing is since you are indeed basing this entire argument around generilizations your right it comes down to a point of not needing sources and a entire debate of hasty generilizations. If we are going to that point then it is that all liberatarians could not take the republican vote due to that with experience libertarians focus more importantly on major issues in a heriarchy rather than what is important and what is not. If we voted directly on beliefs then we have to go into what do libertarians belive. What is directly important to libertarians. In your first argument ""Most republicans I speak with are also fiscally conservative and socially liberal. Only the fringe religious right want to tell you who you can marry and what you can smoke. Most conservatives aren't for telling you what you can do in your bedroom, but for keeping government small, taxes low, and spending under control. That's why they are so frustrated with the current administration."" We can assume this is a hasty generilisation just as well since you are interpreting what is important to republicans and there beliefs. This just as well works in libertarian belifs due to they must have a set of beliefs to take votes away from the two parties. Well then you have a proven point since is it not the purpose of a third party to take away votes from the major parties. Since you stated that ""If everyone voted their beliefs instead of their parties, I believe the Libertarians would be able to take at least half from each party."" Well then are we simply debating conservative vs liberal. In this turn instead of democrat vs republican vs liberatarian are we not simply debating conservative vs liberal vs moderate? As shown people do vote based on these beliefs and as opposed to a liberatrian in the senate we have another ""moderate"" party known as independents. So in turn if we voted this way as opposed to votes being taken from major parties to libratarians then would isnt the idea of libertarians loosing all votes to the major parties equally realistic?",0,Extempjordan,"

"DERRICK Z.

On Capitol Hill, Tutu became a public relations disaster for Reagan. Tutu started off the hearing by saying apartheid itself ""is evil, is immoral, is un- Christian, without remainder.""

Even Reagan's Republican allies told the South African Embassy they would reluctantly support sanctions if Pretoria did not move to end apartheid. Reagan was not moved. Over the remainder of his presidency, at least 3,000 people would die, mostly at the hands of the South African police and military. Another 20,000, including 6,000 children, according to one estimate by a human rights group, would be arrested under ""state of emergency"" decrees. Yet Reagan had the gall to say in 1985 that the ""reformist administration"" of South Africa had ""eliminated the segregation that we once had in our own country."" In 1986, Reagan gave a speech where he said Mandela should be released but denounced sanctions with crocodile tears, claiming that they would hurt black workers, who were already ridiculously impoverished. Reagan's go-slow speech was denounced by Tutu, who said: ""I found it quite nauseating. I think the West, for my part, can go to hell. . . . Your president is the pits as far as blacks are concerned. He sits there like the great, big white chief of old.""",0,left_wing_mormon,"

Another 20,000, including 6,000 children, according to one estimate by a human rights group, would be arrested under ""state of emergency"" decrees.  
  
Yet Reagan had the gall to say in 1985 that the ""reformist administration"" of South Africa had ""eliminated the segregation that we once had in our own country."" In 1986, Reagan gave a speech where he said Mandela should be released but denounced sanctions with crocodile tears, claiming that they would hurt black workers, who were already ridiculously impoverished. Reagan's go-slow speech was denounced by Tutu, who said: ""I found it quite nauseating. I think the West, for my part, can go to hell. . . . Your president is the pits as far as blacks are concerned. He sits there like the great, big white chief of old.""",Politics,3,Reagan-was-immoral-and-evil/2/,44897,0.15755216777324677

"I accept your definitions. I will assume your use of the word 'greater power' is an issue of semantics rather than an attempt to change the intention of the debate. Firstly, what is faith? As you have defined it, faith is belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence. So you would claim that believing in God is faith because there is no empirical evidence for his existence. My claim isn't that Atheists believe in some all-powerful creator, but that they have to have faith to even start their world view. For example, let's take one of the most common arguments between Christians, a type of Theist, and Atheists: Origin of everything: (What or who created the universe?) Christians say: God. Who created God? No one, he was always there. (We've arrived at an axiom that is consistent with the Munchhausen theory of axiomatic reasoning.) God was always there? But there's no tangible proof, there's no empirical evidence so it is a belief based in faith. Atheists say: ""The most commonly held view is that the universe was once a gravitational singularity , which expanded extremely rapidly from its hot and dense state."" Where did the gravitational singularity come from? ""While this expansion is well-modeled by the Big Bang theory , the origins of the singularity remains one of the unsolved problems in physics ."" No proof for the origin of the gravitational singularity? No evidence for the causation of energy dispersal? Once again: a belief based in faith.

Or some believe the universe always existed or there are other theories, but the one thing they all have in common is that something or some force or some material existed (Some theories even state that larger universes existed) but they cannot even hypothesize how. And even if they do hypothesize, there is no tangible proof or evidence suggesting how this is possible. God as an unexplainable force is a theory in the same way that 0+0=Universe is a theory.

"Those that claim marriage as a religious institution are simply wrong. Marriage was around long before Christianity and is not a religious monopoly. Furthermore, you have to examine what marriage actually IS rather than how it is perceived by SOME people. The idea of marriage did not come from the Bible and a democracy caters to more religions than Christian ones. You say that unlinking marriage from the state would be the secular thing to do since we are supposed to have a separation of church and state, but in fact it would be the exact opposite. Since marriage is not a purely Biblical idea and is not a Christian monopoly, to unlink it from the state would be to kowtow to religious demands and to enact legislation on the basis of religious pressure in a supposedly secular country. Furthermore if you took marriage away from the state it would entirely lose any definition that it has. Every different religious denomination and secular institution would define it differently. The Muslim marriage and the Mormon marriage and the gay marriage would all become defined as entirely different things. The Church of Scientology might end up being granted a licence to marry its members and who knows what twisted and perverse definition they might conjure up. If you kept civil partnership as a state practice and people could go off and then essentially upgrade their partnership in a church, we would have the exact same problem we have now. Gay people would get their civil partnership from the state and would likely be unable to upgrade it to a full marriage since the major religions wouldn't grant them the 'marriage' upgrade. Then straight married couples would still be in a position to look down on same-sex unions as something less valid than their own union which has been 'ordained by God' in an anti-gay church. That is essentially a way of allowing the religious to keep the concept of marriage to themselves when it has never been a purely religious concept anyway. Your idea would still bestow different levels of prestige onto different marriage-granting organisations, and thus different levels of validity onto different marriages. The notion that heterosexuality is superior to homosexuality would survive and flourish instead of dying off naturally with the emergence of subsequent generations.",0,Husker,"
  
Those that claim marriage as a religious institution are simply wrong. Marriage was around long before Christianity and is not a religious monopoly. Furthermore, you have to examine what marriage actually IS rather than how it is perceived by SOME people. The idea of marriage did not come from the Bible and a democracy caters to more religions than Christian ones. You say that unlinking marriage from the state would be the secular thing to do since we are supposed to have a separation of church and state, but in fact it would be the exact opposite.

So now that I have efficiently proven that you don't HAVE to be a vegetarian to help the environment, I'll tackle your theory or eating animals hurting our world. If you want to be 100% environmentally friendly you can eat meat. Going to farms that give they're animals special attention, open pastures to graze in, and no chemicals is the key. These animals live healthy lives, and animals fecal mater can be gathered, and used as natural fertilizer for vegetarian's vegetables. Also, think of ALL the land that would be monopolized if every single person in the world went vegetarian. Not to mention the equipment used to harvest, process, and deliver the veggies. To live a totally comfortable life, no body is going to be perfect, environmentally. Our job should be to do everything possible to make sure we're thinking about our impact, and take steps to make our world cleaner. Beef is the animal that releases the most carbon into the atmosphere. Human's release more. What about the carbon chickens, or chicken eggs release? The chicken close to none, and the egg absolutely none. Should we all stop eating poultry and fish because beef releases carbon? Carbon is a natural gas, and in moderation is normal. Man made production of carbon is what we need to watch out for and moderate. Would vegetarian's want to kill all of these carbon releasing animals for the ozone? I don't think so. If human's weren't polluting, then we wouldn't have to think about the carbon released from animals. This, to me is a step off the path of making our world environmentally friendly. Thinking this way is a big deterrent for meat eating people to want to be involved in doing they're part of keeping the world clean. Don't mark meat eating people as hater's of the world. Why don't we all work together and think of feasible ways to help. Having everyone stop eating meat is impossible, and naive.

"I would like to debate someone who is willing to put thought into this debate. I request that all arguments be at least 1,000 characters (1/5 of the cap) in length. I would also like to avoid semantic disputes surrounding the resolution. This debate is about the mistake countries have made and continue to make by spending millions on condoms to send to African countries. Arguments I will begin by outlining my arguments. Once I see which parts my opponent contends, I will elaborate on those specific parts. 1. The distribution of condoms harms women by taking away a major tool they have for protecting themselves against undesired sexual pressures. In African society, a man who impregnates a woman is considered responsible for protecting and supporting the child. This allows women to use this risk of responsibility as a defense. Condoms invalidate this by vastly decreasing the probability of pregnancy. They also make men feel less responsible for any children created during sex while using condoms because condoms give a false sense of security against pregnancy. 2. Condom distribution doesn't significantly decrease HIV/AIDS. It's likely that they don't even reduce the prevalence of these diseases. Countries in which condoms have been widely distributed for years are still dealing with HIV/AIDS epidemics. Hundreds of thousands of Africans still die each year because of AIDS. 3. Condom distribution can increase the prevalence of AIDS. If people think that they can have risk-free sex by using a condom, they are likely to have sex more often and with a greater range of partners. Although condoms have a high success rate, it's still imperfect. If people have sex more often because they have condoms, it's possible that the increase in sexual activity will override the intended disease preventing effect of increased condom usage. 4. The money spent on distributing condoms could be better spent on education about abstinence and HIV/AIDS for African countries. Although the sex using condoms is less likely to spread HIV than sex not using condoms, not having sex at all decreases the chances by an enormous factor. If our current efforts being channeled into condom distribution were largely shifted into efforts to discourage polygamy, prostitution, sex before marriage, and sex with multiple partners, we would be much more likely to attain the desired result of reducing the harm caused by HIV/AIDS in Africa. Instead of encouraging more sex in an HIV/AIDS infused culture through widespread distribution of condoms, we should encourage more abstinence and monogamy. Even if my opponent can show that condom distribution actually does decrease HIV/AIDS, my opponent must also fulfill the burden of showing that resources being diverted from condom distribution to abstinence/HIV/AIDS education wouldn't be a more effective means of dealing with Africa's HIV/AIDS problem. Thank you. I hope this will be a good, informative debate.",0,Procrastarian,"

Strength and power are respected. Strong people don't want to use pity, they don't want pity at all. We aren't over stepping our bounds out there, we aren't claiming Iraq as our own. We are actually helping people, of course you don't see that. You see the Marines arrested on CNN for murder(cause of liberals that don't understand war), or another car bomb going off. You don't see he new schools or roads. You don't see the kids playing in the parks again. You don't even care. Your so fixated on Bush lying, so what? Presidents lie, that is what they do. The war was justified, and a statement to the world that America is not and will not be a target!  
  
I am sick of you liberals crying about the war. You don't know crap about war. Wars aren't fought by liberals, they are fought by conservative patriots. Your not the ones bleeding in the battlefield. Of course there is the odd liberal that joins for the college money thinking he won't get deployed, then when he gets called up he wets his pants and does anything to get out of it, but the mass majority of soldiers are conservative. Don't talk about stuff you don't know about. Now go have your abortions, and protest some executions of killers.

"Before I go into the morality of the two crimes I want to clear up some common misconceptions. The first misconception is that adults are somehow more 'on guard' than children and more capable of defending themselves against rapists than a child is to a pedophile.

They instinctively spot easy targets who are unguarded and alone[ <URL>... ] and may even use drugs to assist them in doing so[ <URL>... ]. The actual definition, and concept, of rape is that the victim is powerless and not consenting to it. Thus to assert that children are more vulnerable to pedophiles is to completely misunderstand what rape is. Rape is not 'roughing' another adult up, it is completely taking them and abusing them with 0% of their consent being involved in the process. Another common misconception is that pedophiles are more at large than rapists are. This is actually false in every single country around the world. I challenge my opponent to prove differently. If he demands proof, I shall give a few countries' statistics as proof in R3. Now I shall go on to combat some common contentions of Con in this debate. The first is the idea that children are less likely to report pedophiles than adults are to report rapes and so they need more encouragement. This is a completely unfounded statement and is not true in the least. Adult rape victims, in fact especially the more mature ones, feel that they must keep all their problems to themselves and deal with everything alone (unlike children who turn to their parents and friends for advice and guidance). Thus it is actually more likely to get out if it's a child. I shall now make two contention of my own and justify them: Contention 1: Rape leave a harsher psychological aftermath in the adults mind than nonviolent molestation does in the child's. Contention 2: The level of awareness that adults have in comparison to children means that much more of the experience will be remembered. Contention 3: The additional physical damage of rape makes it indefinitely more immoral than molestation.

Thus, Rape is more psychologically damaging than child molestation. Justification 2: Speaks for itself. Justification 3: The morality of an act is based around the severity of damage that an act leaves behind. I cannot think of any other rational basis for morality.

"Thanks for accepting the debate. May the best argument win. ""1. This argument is based on personal opinion. It would totally depend on what was being destroyed. If you want to see the cosmos shatter in an awe inspiring explosion, then I would go with CGI. Small scale destruction is fine and dandy but I do not believe NCBT (non-computer based techniques) can compete on as large a scale as CGI can. Again this argument is based on personal preference but judging by how well Avatar did, it's safe to say that CGI can excite people more than NCBT."" I agree that this argument is based on personal opinion. My opinion is that whilst CGI can certainly be used to represent destruction on a vast scale, it doesn't make that destruction any less ""fake"". Take for example the star fighter models used in the original Star Wars trilogy v.s. the CGI star fighters used in the prequels. In the original, you had dozens of scale models being blown up in real fiery explosions. The use of models and pyrotechnics created a realistic depiction of an otherwise fantastical situation: an epic battle in space. In the prequels, all people were seeing ware animations of ships and explosions, rather than real explosions, so that an impossible situation remained impossible, because rather than trying to make a fantastical situation seem real, the CGI just reinforces the fact that it isn't real. ""2. This would depend on the plot and character development. No amount of NCBT or CGI can make you care about a character or story without a thrilling plot. On this basis I would consider them equal. But I would like to point out that basically any movie by Pixar has had a saddening scene that without a doubt, touched the audience's heart."" I agree that plotting and character development are very important in determining whether your going sympathise with a character or not and that includes real actors as well. I believe films that are *entirely* CGI should not count in this debate, as we are debating the use of practical v.s. CG *special* effects. An effect that is used to represent the entire film ceases to become special. Though I do agree that Pixar are the gods of CGI animated films! On CGI v.s. practical effects characters in films with good character development and plotting, a practical effects character will always come out excellent. But if a CG character is not made to look almost convincingly real, then the fact that it is obviously fake makes watching it at least an awkward experience, regardless of how well the CGI character is voice acted or whatever. 3. CGI can require a serious amount of coding skill and a passion for design. I am not 100% certain that there is a way to prove NCBT users spend more time creating their product than CGI users spend coding and designing their own creation. You need to prove to me that NCBT actually requires more time than CGI creation (including art design? Your call.) I'm not denying that creating CGI takes skill or that the people creating it aren't passionate. I think that depending on the type of effects used, the time it takes is different. I know that stop motion takes a lot of time in that the models have to be moved the tiniest bit and shots taken over and over again to simulate movement. ""4. True. No one can really get excited about how a model was crafted in a computer program, no matter the amount of time put into it."" Glad we agree on this point.

I know that stop motion takes a lot of time in that the models have to be moved the tiniest bit and shots taken over and over again to simulate movement.  
  
""4. True. No one can really get excited about how a model was crafted in a computer program, no matter the amount of time put into it.""  
  
Glad we agree on this point.  
  
Sorry about repeating a point I already made on the 5th one. Looking forward to your responses to these and the 6th point as well. Again thank you for accepting this debate.",Entertainment,1,Practical-special-effects-are-better-than-CG-special-effects/1/,42348,0.0037979939952492714

"First off, I would like to thank you for opening this debate. Moving on; Now, it is my understanding that your two main points stemming from your opening argument are these: (1) Online Social Networks are waste of time for everyone except for advertisers -and- (2) Users can be exploited because of what information they post onto the site. To begin, I will answer your first argument, by highlighting three types of users that make accounts on social networks (SNW) 1: The casual user 2: The specialist 3: The hardcore user (1) Casual User: These are the ones that create accounts maybe because it's the cool thing to do, or just to keep up on the goings on in there life with friends/family/etc. They typically check there account every few days, answering messages/friend requests/wall posts, things of that nature. The benefits of the SNW for these users are small, but they justify actually having accounts. On most SNWs, one is able to create an event, and invite friends to it. This is one plus from social networking, the ability to plan things online, and talk to people that you may not normally talk to. Also, it can be used as a beefed-up email, if one misses an assignment, they can message a peer to get the notes. Moving on: (2) Specialist: These are the ones that make accounts, because of something they do. Myspace has gotten a lot of credibility for Myspace Music, a subsidy of the large site. A lot of current musicians have Myspace accounts that people can go to, to listen to music. Myspace Music has helped propel many artists. One such is Josephine Collective, a band out of Johnson County Kansas. They're one of the biggest things in Kansas right now, and have a very large cult following. Because of their Myspace page, a Warner Music representative offered them a contract, and they will have a major label release in the summer. Also, there have been specialized sites that musician's can sign onto, such as Purevolume, or Imeem. Because of the mass amount of SNWs out there that support music, a lot of indie bands have gained popularity, such as Vampire Weekend and the Black Keys. Specialized SWNs aren't just limited to music, though. While major ones such as Facebook allow groups to be made, so say, a runner can find running partners, there are smaller, more intimate sites, that allow everyone to know each other. There are sites for certain sports, or for people who like to write. Now onto number three. (3) Hardcore Users: These are the ones that basically live online. Now, whether or not people in the ""real world"" think this is right or not, the user still does it. It might seem like a bad habit, but in actuality, aside from the chance of becoming overweight, it really isn't. There are plenty of people in the world like this, the ones shunned by their peers, the ones that no one in ""real life"" likes. But, they thrive online, by talking to people just like them. Perhaps they just have an interest in something that no one in their town does. That's what's beautiful about the internet, is that you can find another person that shares the same interests as you. To tell people like this that SWNs waste their time, is just overzealous, because you're not the one living their life. Perhaps it's your goal to do things off the internet, but here are just three prime examples of people that, while they may be on SWNs a lot, don't waste their time. It's there choice, not yours. Now, onto my second argument: Although there have been instances where people have been scammed, or kidnapped, because of what they post online, this really isn't the majority. When you have millions of people signed onto these thing, having a few thousand get hurt isn't significant. Not to mention the fact that the sites clearly state about the threats of putting information out into the public. Also, there are privacy settings that a user could implement, and it comes down to good judgment and common sense. This isn't just limited to SWNs, it is a bad thing that injustices happen, but they'll happen on any level of the internet, if the person is ignorant enough to fall into a trap. It can happen to Myspace users, it can happen to blog users. The internet isn't safe, but, it's not dangerous either, if you have common sense. In conclusion, it's pretty selfish to have your viewpoint, because everyone makes accounts for different reasons. Just because you may not want to ""waste your time on one"" doesn't mean that it is, in fact, a waste of time. Thank You. -BBE",0,behindblueeyes,"

"Let me explain the topic. Throughout history peoples have sought to impose their religion on other, claiming their beliefs to be superior to others. It is my argument that the idea of one religion being logically superior to another is fallacious. Thus no religious belief is anymore valid than any other. First of all, to clarify, I am not an Atheist. I am agnostic. I do not deny there is a god, nor do I believe there is one. I find Atheism to be hypocritical because Atheists accuse theists of having no proof, but they also cannot DISPROVE the existence of God. Rather I believe that humans cannot possibly ever know if there is a god or not and as such should not devote our live to worship of one. --- In order for a religion to be superior to another their must be some logical reason to prefer it to over others. As Friedrich Nietzsche wrote ""There cannot be a God because if there were one, I could not believe that I was not He."" While this claim seems narcissistic if we look at what Nietzsche means, we come to our logical flaw. If we can assign some super characteristic to an unknown entity what possible reason is there to exclude the possibility of infinite gods? it is impossible to find ONE reason why any belief in god is either more or less correct than any other belief. finding such a reason is impossible because someone will always have a counter claim to any religious puzzle that they will believe is most valid. Religion cannot be warranted without appeal to itself. It is a classical example of circular reasoning. In order for the conclusion to be true the premise must be true and in order for the premise to be true the conclusion must also be true. Thus the logical basis for religion requires fallacy. In order for a religion to be superior, tenants of that religion must be true as well. For example if religion A says there is an afterlife and religion B says we just go away, it could be argued that A is superior because of an afterlife. However this automatically presumes A to be right in the first place. But A has no more claims to validity than B or C so thus we cannot presume that religion A is superior. Religious belief is always going to require a leap of faith. And because such a leap of faith is dependent upon the individual making it, there is absolutely no way for any religion to be logically superior unless we either make another leap of faith or logical fallacy. Making a leap of faith automatically discounts any logical value since it would be equivalent to a syllogism that read: A=B B=C A=E Thus because any claims of religious superiority require fallacious reasoning there is no such thing as a logically superior religion.",0,Metz,"

"First of all, I'd like to thank enersonm for this debate and for allowing me to argue against them. I'd like to address my opponent's contentions: 1. They could save an animal from being endangered. The concept of ""endangered animals"" isn't restricted to just one individual of a species. Instead, it is the entire species that is endangered, usually directly or indirectly by humans. That being said, a zoo is, no matter how hard we try to make it, not an animal's nature habitat. Preserving a species in captivity is not really preserving them at all. It is artificial. These animals come to rely too much on their caretakers, and when released into the wild have hard times trying to adapt to the natural order. 2. Zoos provide medical care for animals. Only for the animals they keep. The whole reason these zoos have medical care is not out of what is morally right, but for their audience. The more animals, especially exotic ones, that are sick, the less of them people see, and thus the less people who visit the zoo and pay for tickets and concessions. Zoos are ultimately, for profit. Now, I'd like to provide my own contention: 1. Exotic animals should not be captured from the wild, transported to foreign countries, and put on display. Separating animals from their environment is inherently bad for their quality of life, even if they are provided medical care and adequate nutrition. Many have problems adapting to the new environs of the climates they have been transported, unwillingly, to. They easily become sick, and can be exposed to other animals who are not native to their own native habitats. Animals bred in captivity lose the natural instincts and learning they would have received from living in the natural environment of their home habitats. When they are released back into the environment, they have hard times trying to adapt to it. Trying to conserve almost extinct species by transporting them into captivity is the last nail in the coffin of extinction.",0,smlburridge,"

  Thank you Con, for your arguments.  ""  Now, with e-mails and texts, people can send messages, photos, videos and much more from one corner of the world to another. They can talk over phones even when they're not at home, and even when they're not in the same country. They can Skype each other; this virtual face-to-face reality was hard to imagine even 60 years ago.  ""  Now, with e-mails and texts, people can send messages,photos,videos and much more from one corner of the world to another. ""Another"" here may mean anyone. My point is, This means have increases the probability of loved ones cheating each other. ""they can talk over phones and even send photos"" This has made cheating loved ones a very common factor.According to surveys, 67 % females in the United states cheat their husbands...(a)Morality has decreased by a considerable rate. Earlier, Women were very decent and the low means of communication meant that almost no scope for cheating was possible. Skype has made it more horrible. Webcam sex and Online flirt is such a common factor nowadays!! The consequences to this are dire!!

President Bush is without a doubt not the worst president in American history. I would put my money, the smart money, on Herbert Hoover. Here's why; 1) Herbert Hoover is responsible for the worst of the Great Depression. His principles of limited government IN THE FACE OF TOTAL ECONOMIC DISASTER led America to such a low that it took a 4 year war and 110,000 American lives to dig us out, not counting how many poor and impoverished people starved to death. 2) What did Hoover accomplish? Sure, he oversaw the greatest boom in American history, but also sat by and watched as the country tore itself apart. There are times when a man has to rethink his policies, and his slavery to the upper class and bankers created far more problems than were necessary. 3) Hoover's inaction led to a spectacular drop in world standards of living. I can say, with reasonable logic, that Hoover helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. It was indirect, but the connection is there. Hoover doesn't help the American economy recover-> Whole world suffers in depression because America isn't buying anymore-> Germany is racked by starvation and poverty-> Hitler sees opening, takes power-> You know the rest Bush is a moron yes, but definitely not the worst president ever.

You do bring up some very good points, however, gun control, censorship, gay marriage, and abortion are all debatable whether or not they are problems or not. I would say that an American problem would be defined as being a problem that every American can define as being a problem. A gay person would not find their gay marriage to be a problem, a woman who has an abortion might not see it as a moral problem, someone who carries a gun might feel that it is their right to, and as far as censorship laws go, I hardly see that as a problem in America. Therefore, looking at some of the serious critical nationwide accepted problems, they are all based on greed. Your reversal to my above point might be to question whether or not these points are real problems as well, so I will explain: Immigration: (12 million people living in the shadows in a desperate time of national security is a problem, posed not only for our safety but also putting stress on our infrastructure). Why is immigration still allowed? Well very simply because the businesses that hire them for near slave labor are allowed to stay in business. Why are they allowed to? Because they fluff the pockets of politicians via lobbyists (you might also argue that the gun control and other arguments discussed above could be provented if it weren't for lobbyists +money ) aka GREED. Energy/oil: Exxon mobile made 30-40 billion dollars in one quarter of 2007, while many Americans are struggling with increasing gas prices. How could this happen: GREED. Why isn't the government more poised toward shifting to a more oil independent system? LOBBYISTS FROM EXXON!!! AKA GREED! Health care: why isn't health-care more affordable? Because corporations that make the drugs, and because the entire health industry has unnaturally boosted its prices above the expected and reasonable price: GREED! Since I did not specify monetary greed, I will also throw in the following point: Nuclear tensions: The United States currently has THOUSANDS of nuclear warheads. This is completely irrational, seeing as most scientists agree that if 12 were to go off at around the same time it would put the globe into extinction.

"I'd like to thank my opponent for accepting my challenge and I would also like apologize for my own slow response. I would like to begin by stating my main contentions and by defining my position. As the affirmative I believe that if the United States republican party were to take a pro-gay rights stance officially, it would be quite beneficial to the party in the respect that they would see an increase in support. I will support this with my contentions and arguments. First, I believe that because the republican party is a conservative party, they should take this stance to encourage less government interference in the personal lives of Americans. Second, the republican party could expect to see more independent voters cote republican during elections. Also I believe that pro-gay rights more so aligns with the traditional ideals of the republican party pre-twentieth century. Conservatism traditionally has been defined in politics as a sentiment of having minimal government interference in the day to day lives of citizens. Nowadays it is defined as wanting to stick to the traditional system and maintaining only the status quo. I would contend that the former definition is a much more universal and powerful political stance to take, after all it is the stance that the signers of the declaration of independence took and also the stance of political thinker John Locke, for whom many American values are based. I believe that preventing gays from getting married is a regulatory interference in the personal and economic lives of both homosexual citizens and the persons with the power to marry them, and is therefore anti-conservative. The republican party should take a pro-gay rights stance to increase voter support as well. Gallup polls show that 52% of Americans are in favor of gay rights(1). This may not seem like a very large majority but 31% of republicans are already in support of gay marriage (2). Since the republican party is not a single interest party, changing this one stance in the party could result in an increase in its vote base among all independent and third party voters and possibly even convince certain democratic party members to start voting republican. Many other notable conservatives such as Ron Paul and Former Vice President Dick Cheney and former first lady Laura Bush are all in favor of homosexual marriage. Before the twentieth century, the conservative parties stood for equality and minimal government interference in the personal lives of Americas. I ask you, why has that changed? I could not tell you for sure why some people think that being a conservative should be about fighting change rather than fighting for individual liberty and the freedom to pursue happiness. Are homosexuals people? Yes. Are they citizens of the United States of America? Yes! Should they therefore enjoy equal rights just the same as every other liberty loving individual in America? Yes! Should they therefore be allowed to pursue personal happiness and fulfillment? Yes! Should big government prevent that? I am a conservative and I say no!

"My least favorite place in the existence of all lively hood without a doubt is the scum that is Kmart... You see, this is where I work on a weekly basis, and I HATE IT! There are several reasons for this, and one of those reasons is their clever system of scheduling. For example, next Tuesday I work from 6:00 p.m. - 12:15 a.m. This would be the week of semester tests by the way. Speaking of which, I work from 7:00 p.m. - 12:15 a.m. the night before semester tests. I think that this is ridiculous, that the night before one of the most important school days of the year and I am required to stay up way too late or lose my job. Therefore, I propose that we ought to be illegal to require students to work past 10:00 p.m. on school nights. By doing this, we will: A) Give equal opportunity to everyone. -You see, most of my friends don't have jobs. They will be able to get plenty of sleep that night and therefore gain an advantage over me. But by voting pro, you recognize equal opportunity for all. B) Push students to the point of suicide less often. -Do we really want suicide rates like Japan?!?! The reason so many students kill themselves there is because of their amount of workload. But if we give students more time to do their homework AND prepare for tests, then fewer suicides will inevitably happen, and no child will be left behind in a way that doesn't tick everyone off. C) Concentration on what is important will be achieved. -SCHOOL COMES FIRST! This is not words that just exist, there is MEANING to them. You see, now that they have done this, I feel I have no choice but to quit Kmart, and will thus make it harder for me to save money for college. An all around bad deal for me.

"You say that government should stay out of marriage but then seem to take it back when you allude to the legal chaos it would cause. The problem with giving marriage over to private institutions like churches is that some marriage-granting institutions would likely become regarded as more prestigious than others. People may technically all become more equal in the eyes of the law, but the institution of marriage would become vastly more unequal. One marriage-granting institution may come to be regarded as a prestigious one and it may happen to be an institution that forbids gay marriage or that considers all marriages outside of that particular faith as invalid. If people were free to marry in their own institution, say the Catholic Church, then they may consider themselves more married than their counterparts. When someone introduced their wife or their husband, anyone of a strict evangelical faith would no doubt be thinking ""they're not really as married as I am because I was married in a good Catholic Church while they were married by the Church of England."" This gets even worse when we talk about same sex marriage. If same sex marriage were legalised and formalised in the law, it would eventually gain the sort of unquestioned acceptance that women being given the vote now has. However take the state out of the equation and give this over to private institutions and gay marriage will NEVER be accepted, as all of its opponents will simply regard any marriage conducted by an institution they don't recognise as invalid.

"If you can't provide evidence for your choice, then your choice has not been substantiated. There is objective evidence on what people find attractive. For instance, studies evaluate what people find attractive in a face. As an example, people generally prefer a more pointy nose than a flat one. Your only claim for Vicki being hotter is her face, but you provide no basis for this choice. Also a certain look can be considered hot, but a face by itself is usually not described as such. The debate is about who is hotter. You define hot as sexy, and I will accept that. A rump is part of sex appeal. It is one area that will sexually stimulate a person. A face will usually not give you a boner, at least by itself. Boner inducing parts alone are the rear, the breasts, legs, etc. These are combined with action that gives a woman sex appeal. The parts and actions are measureable. One example is the classic 36-24-36. Much of it is also binary, as in it's there or not there. Both women perform sexy action, as in getting down on all fours. Tamara however, provides the additional, such as the thigh touching, hair swinging, and sly camera glances. These objectively occur. Yes, their point IS actually to have a big a.ss. Vicki even says that her video here is about getting a ""big, round butt."" Watch for quote about 30 seconds into this video: <URL>... . Again, these are objective. The goal is to have a big butt and Tamara wins that contest. The fantasy part you speak of is a consequence of watching the video. After all, who would not get a hard on watching either one of these girls? Next point. I think the blond hair of Tamara gives her an edge over the dark hair of Vicki. I am partial to dark hair, but I have to acknowledge that blond hair is somewhat objectively better. Blonds have traditionally had this higher aura than dark hair. Redheads can be this exceptional enigma and brunettes have this dark beauty, but more often than not, the red-blooded American male has this fascination, intrigue and infatuation with the blond. Blond Marilyn Monroe had it over anyone in pin-up girl history. The blond hair is also more appealing in the nether region. Even if a girl shaves her hair, the blond hair is often more appealing in that area. The shaven dark hair can appear more coarse, like a shadow. The blond hair seems more subtle, velvety, gentle, delicate. Even a slightly furry blond area can be more appealing than shaved dark hair. If you had to look at a full bush like in some older girly magazine you find at a garage sale, then you would rather see a big blond bush than a big brown bush.",0,frankabe,"

"I affirm the resolution stating Resolved: Individuals have a moral obligation to assist people in need. I will be using the value of Morality. I will be supporting this with a value criterion of Utilitarianism. My value criterion upholds my value because by doing things that provide the most good for the most number of people, then morality will be achieved. I will be supporting this with three contentions. Contention 1:There is no downside to the moral obligation. Sub-point A: The Veil of Ignorance makes the moral obligation in the best interest of all. In John Rawl's Veil of Ignorance, every situation is judged from the perspective of both sides, under a ""veil of ignorance"", which reshuffles everybody's position in society. For example, slavery is judged to be morally wrong, because the pain of the slave outweighs the benefits of the slaveholder, and the people in the scenario don't know which side of the situation they could be in. Immanuel Kant states this in simpler terms by stating that situations may arise in which we will eventually be the ones in need of help, and those are the grounds that this moral obligation exists. Because Rawls and Kant both state that this is in the best interest of all, then the moral obligation is utilitarian, and therefore achieves morality. Sub-point B: Singer and Kant put practical limits to the moral obligation. Peter Singer and Immanuel Kant state that the moral obligation does not apply when the following exceptions occur: when helping somebody puts yourself in need, when helping others causes you to neglect other obligations to society already in place, or if the person helping does not agree to the cause of the person in need. Because these statements suddenly make the obligation attainable and don't risk the loss of anything morally significant, that means that it upholds the good of lots of people, and therefore more than achieves morality. Contention 2: The obligation can be fulfilled despite personal limitations. Sub-point A: the most somebody can do in a situation is what counts. There is always a possibility in which somebody is in need of help, but the person obligated to help has limitations that prevent them from completely helping out the person in need. For example, somebody may be drowning in a lake, but the person who is obligated to help can't swim. That doesn't negate the obligation. On the contrary, the individual would instead be obligated to do the most that they can, such as call 911. Thus, the greatest good can still be achieved despite personal limitations, and morality is achieved. Sub-point B: the individual isn't required to solve the problem by themselves. As stated in the previous sub-point, the individual doesn't have to completely solve the problem given to them if they have personal limitations. This also goes for helping those who are without a home. For one person to devote their entire income by themselves to a homeless person is absurd. That is why there are charities in place. People aren't meant to help others on their own. Therefore any argument that my opponent makes against the practicality of being obligated to help others is null. Contention 3: Morality is objective Sub-point A: the Veil of Ignorance views situations with the best interests of all people in mind. Because, as explained before, the veil of ignorance reshuffles everybody's place in society to judge situations with complete objectivity, the veil can be best used in this debate to objectively judge situations, then, logically, the situations judged with the veil are ideal for utilitarianism to be upheld, and therefore the veil can be shown to be essential to upholding my value of morality. Sub-point B: Suffering is Undesirable. Everybody can agree that the suffering of an individual is bad. Everybody has a standard reaction to pain and suffering. When you see somebody hurt on the side of the road, there is a standard reaction of feeling bad, or at least pity for those in pain. By going off of this standard reaction to suffering, we can use this as a baseline for the definition of morality. By using this definition of morality in this debate, we can agree that there is no question of morality from person to person. In conclusion, the moral obligation stated in the resolution does exist, and therefore I have affirmed the resolution. To go over my contentions again, there is no downside to the resolution.

"First of all, when the word ""Possible"" appears in the title of a debate, one would expect to see some works in the mathematical field of Probability & Statistics. Pro didn't even present an estimated probability of life forming from non living material. All what Pro presented was a story. This turned into this then turned into this then turned into this then came the first cell. When we're discussing the possibility of Abiogenesis, one must calculate the yield rate of each step and then multiply the probabilities to reach the ultimate probability. Then iterate this probability by the available simultaneous trials since the big bang. This is the only way to theoretically predict the possibility. Experimentally, I think mankind is way behind to fully test this. You see, the more you describe how simple the first cell was, the more you make it easier for scientists to create it in labs, and we all know that didn't happen. And please don't rely on that source that mentions the generation of new lifeforms through genetic mutation, because they didn't create life from non-living things. I'm guessing there are thousands of scientists from around the world trying to put some strands of RNA in fatty acid membranes and whatever else there needs to be in an attempt to create a living cell from non-living material. We all know, of course, no one succeeded. The only glimpse of hope for Abiogenesis is the Miller-Urey experiment. In the following, I will show you how this very experiment can work as a proof against Abiogenesis and not for it. I will use the same method of calculations I used in round 2 trying to predict the amount of functioning proteins the Miller-Urey experiment would produce: Let's assume the Miller-Urey experiment, in 13 days, produced only 0.01 grams of amino acids = 0.01x6.023E23/75(molecular weight of glycine)= 8E19 molecule. And let's assume it was given a period of one day (the last day of the two week experiment) to try and produce proteins (specifically our small 32 long protein). The total number of events will be equal to 1 day in nanoseconds multiplied by the number of amino acid molecules (8E19), divided by 32 = 8E13 * 8E19 / 32 = 2E32 event (simultaneous and continuing for a whole day). From my argument in round 2, I concluded the probability of producing a functional protein from a set of 32 amino acids to be 1.08E-19. But we have a lot more events. This should lead to protein production with an estimated amount of 2E32 * 1.08E-19 = 2.16E13 protein molecules!!! Do you know what this means? It means that I, Moze, a creationist, predict (through my generous theoretical calculations) that the Miller-Urey experiment will produce 2.16E13 protein molecules in one day. However, we all know that it didn't produce one single protein molecule. This means that my original calculations were far more generous than I would have ever imagined. I was way off by 13 orders of magnitude. This is very serious. Finally, I would like to point out some flaws in your argument: - "" Early cells were likely small RNA strands enclosed in fatty acid membranes that have been shown to form naturally and can allow nucleotides to cross the membrane [6]"" The annoying part is ""have been shown to form naturally"". This sentence, whether it speaks of fatty acids or RNA strands, is totally misleading. It claims there is a natural force that governs the molecular interactions and leads them to form RNA strands of Fatty acids. This is totally different than the source you have referenced ([6]). In the source, it only speaks of spontaneous formation for both, and we both know what spontaneous means. It means by chance. Plus you said:""It have been shown"". This is also misleading because it leads you to think the experiment conducted proved this. Allow me to quote the source:""Recent experiments suggest it would have been possible for genetic molecules similar to DNA or to its close relative RNA to form spontaneously"". The language used in the source is very shakey ""would have been possible"" unlike my opponent who decided to use the word ""shown"" which is closer to ""proved"". I might be exaggerating in the last one. Please consider it as an advice to be more clear to our audience. - You mentioned there are 2.5E112 efficient ligases of a 220 nuleotide RNA. But you didn't mention the total number of combinations. My humble calculation says it it is equal to 4.7E198. Now that is mind boggling!! If you disagree with my calculation, please give me your version. You said you barely scratched the surface. I really respect your effort, but some of it was unnecessary. Please try to focus on the probability argument. We both have to get our hands dirtier with numbers in order to reach the truth. Respect & Peace Moze",0,Moze,"

"I am completely against hitting or spanking students for punishment in schools.

This doesnt solve problems it only keeps them calm at the monment of. They will never understand the actual reason you are punishing them unless you talk to them. Second, it is still surpprisingly legal in 23 states in America. The United States is the only state in the western world which still tolerates corporal punishment in its schools. There are many forms of this as in strapping or whipping, and even cuffing the child behind the head. These things start to give some students nervous habits such as nail bitting being the one of the most common. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools and takes issue with laws in some states legalizing such corporal punishment and protecting adults who use it from prosecution for child abuse.

Second, it is still surpprisingly legal in 23 states in America. The United States is the only state in the western world which still tolerates corporal punishment in its schools. There are many forms of this as in strapping or whipping, and even cuffing the child behind the head. These things start to give some students nervous habits such as nail bitting being the one of the most common.  
  
The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment in schools and takes issue with laws in some states legalizing such corporal punishment and protecting adults who use it from prosecution for child abuse.

"It is now the final round in the debate, and my opponent STILL has not offered a reason why anyone would doubt Dany's parents are actually Rhaella and Aerys II Targaryen. It is not enough to simply make a claim that Dany's parents are someone else if you have yet to cast doubt on the understanding of her current parents. If my opponent cannot dis-prove that Aerys and Rhaella are her father, then the rest of the case is meaningless! Why would the mad king have ever had cause to lie about impregnating Rhaella? If Rhaella didn't die during a storm giving birth to Dany, how indeed did she die? My opponent absolutely NEEDS to answer this in the final round, otherwise his theory is flawed at step A. Timeline issues This was never refuted. To re-iterate this point, let get specific. The sack of King's Landing occurs in the beginning of 281 AL. (1) Right after Rhaeger is killed, Aerys sends his pregnant wife Rhaella with Viserys to Dragonstone (which is why neither were in the city when the sack occurred). On Dragonstone, Queen Rhaella dies giving birth to her daughter, Daenerys, a several months after her father died in the fall of King's Landing. During her birth a great storm wrecks what is left of the Targaryen fleet anchored at Dragonstone, for which she is named ""Daenerys Stormborn"". The rebels lack their own fleet so it takes some time to assemble one to assault the island. Eventually, when they realize the rebels will arrive soon, Targaryen loyalists smuggle the Targaryen heirs Viserys and Daenerys to safety in the Free Cities, where they remain in exile. (1) Under my opponents own arguments, he claims that Viserys was never even on Dragonstone. Where did he send Viserys if not with his mother to Dragonstone like he claimed? Who was Rhaella's child? In Ned's dream in ""A Game of Thrones"" when talking to the kingsguard protecting the Tower of Joy, this is said in the brief conversation prior to the skirmish: ""Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him."" In the conversation with Aerys II own Kingsguard it is even confirmed that Viserys went to Dragonstone with his mother. But that's not even the kicker with this point. ""The Raid on the Tower of Joy took place at the Tower of Joy in Dorne at the the end of Robert's Rebellion . "" The raid took place after Robert's Rebellion AFTER viserys was already gone. How did Ned or Edric, or anyone for that matter get ahold of Viserys? Where did it happen, and why did Rhaella not take issue with this? The timeline has so many holes its easy to lose count of them all. Motives Timeline aside, the motivation points are still what get me the most. What Aerys and Rhaella's motives for lying to the world about Rhaella's conception, her travel to Dragonstone? Why did Viserys need to feed lies to Dany to secure his claim on the throne? He was already the male firstborn heir. THE CLAIM TO THE THRONES IS ALREADY HIS ! The Targaryen's are not dornish, they like the rest of the seven kingdoms honor the male King's claim over the Queen's in official ruling. Viserys would have been king no matter what, especially as the elder. This is why he is PRINCE viserys. Claiming Jon Snow's parents are Ashara Dayne and Ned or Brandon at least makes far sense than R + L = D. I am not going to pick apart the Ashara Dayne theory because my opponent agrees that R + L = Something. If he cannot provide an alibi for Rhaella and Viserys location during the sack of King's Landing then every bit of the R + L logic applies to Jon, way more so than the Ashara Dayne theory goes. My opponent uses Ned's quote that he had not thought of Rhaegar for many years as evidence that Jon is not Rhaegar's son. As if it requires being heavily reminded about the bastard's father in order to raise Jon? This makes no sense. My opponent has dropped the case on Braavos having changing whether patterns, and having access to wood and lemon-trees. These point's go uncontested, meaning that there is no reason to doubt that they (The Targaryen children) would be in Braavos. To conclude this debate, my opponent has some serious explaining to do on providing information that is very necessary in order to even entertain the theory of Dany being Lyanna's child. There is so much that simply does not make sense if they are her parents, besides the fact that the timeline is literally impossible.

For all of the reasons above I reject the resolution that Superman sucks.

"First off, I apologize for my round 2 argument, that was supposed to be in the comments section, my bad. A plurality election is any election where 3 or more candidates are running for an election, where the winner only needs a plurality of votes to win. Only difference between a plurality and a majority win is that whoever wins the plurality only wins the most votes which is less then 50%, whereas a majority win is an election where a candidate wins over 50% of the votes and thus is the democratically elected pick to be elected. For example, 1988: George H.W. Bush = 53% of the popular vote Michael Dukakis = 47% of the popular vote ^ Majority election where the winner had over 50% of the vote 1992: Bill Clinton = 43% of the popular vote George H.W. Bush = 38% of the popular vote Ross Perot = 19% of the popular vote ^ Plurality election where only the person who gets the most amount of votes, but doesnt have to have a majority (>50%) of all votes cast Plurality systems are commonly used in the US and the UK where two main parties and an outside third party can compete for an elected position. The system the Pro is arguing for in this case is Proportional Representation, a system where the proportion of elected officials accurately represents the votes cast for an ideology. First off, proportional representation can only be applied towards Congressional or Parliamentary elections, not presidential elections, so plurality elections are already very important if a minor party or an independent wants to make a presidential run. Secondly though, the main issue of this whole debate is the issue that Plurality systems do not represent the proportion of votes cast towards an ideology as much as proportional representation does . However plurality systems that cause disproportional representation is attributed to the geography of the voters and where the votes are cast from, not the voting system itself. Heres an example, lets pretend in an election held in and around London goes as such Labour Party = 2,700,00 votes = 54% Tory party = 2,200,000 Votes = 44% Liberal Democrats = 100,000 Votes = 2% Seat goes to the Labour Party Now lets pretend in another city we see similar results, lets take Liverpool Labour Party = 2,200,000 Votes = 44% Tory Party = 2,750,000 Votes = 54% Liberal Democrats = 100,000 Votes = 2% Seat goes to the Tory Party But now in the far off country side, similar results to the last two elections in other cities Labour Party = 250 Votes = 25% Tory Party = 150 Votes = 15% Liberal Democrats = 600 Votes = 60% Seat goes to the Liberal Dem Party Each party rightfully earned a seat in the house. But proportionally there is an issue, if we tally up all the votes each party got we see something concerning Now out of 10,051,000 votes cast, 200,600 = Liberal Democrat 4,900,250 = Labour 4,950,150 = Tory Now each party got a seat, yet the Liberal Democrat party is clearly lacking compared to the other two parties, in fact Liberal Democrat voters only make up 2% of the total vote, yet they still got a seat through plurality elections . Had there been a proportional representation system in place, then the Liberal democrat party wouldnt have a seat at all, meaning that either a representative of the Tory party or the Labour Party would be elected to represent the countryside town even though they voted in a majority for a Liberal Democratic representative. To summarize this whole example, in a proportional representation system the countryside town would be forced to be represented by a party that the people did not want at all, which goes directly against Democracy and its ideals. Proportional Representation = Politicians represent populations that may prefer a different party than that of the candidates but overall all parties are represented proportionately Plurality System = All places, small or large, get to elect politicians who represent their political preference but the total proportion of elected officials to not align with the voting trends of the population. Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages, but Plurality systems are better democracy wise because in Plurality systems the populations still get to choose who represents them whereas in Proportional representation politicians are selected based on how the entire country votes, not on how a particular town or district votes. This means that centers of heavily concentrated populations have the power to determine the political ideology of the voters within the city and in the less populated areas around the city in proportional representation systems. I believe I have made my point, if there are any arguments I overlooked I will address them in the next round.",0,imabench,"

According to the definition of sacrifice Pro provided there is no reason say that I could no offer my own life in self-sacrifice. Then Pro openly admits that ""Jesus himself had to supposedly do it himself."" Pro has first established the definition of sacrifice, and then told us how Jesus sacrificed himself. By Pro""s own admission Jesus was a sacrifice. Now, to address some of the other points Pro made. Pro says it is ""somewhat inconsistent"" that an innocent person would sacrifice for a guilty person. However, there is nothing inconsistent about the idea. For instance, imagine that my friend hits a baseball through his neighbor's window, but he does not have the money to replace the window. I could pay for the damages. I could sacrifice my money to pay for what my friend has done. Obviously the cost of a life is a more extreme example, but it follows the same principle. We owed a debt we could not pay, so Jesus sacrificed himself for our debt. In his second paragraph, Pro seems to move away from the topic of this debate, but I will address what he wrote. A perfectly just God cannot simply ignore sin. That would be a crime against justice. To ignore sin would not be an issue of power. To ignore sin would a violation of God""s nature, a self-contradiction, and that is something God cannot do. Justice must be satisfied. So to satisfy justice God took the punishment on Himself. He came to earth as a man, lived a life that in no way deserved death, and sacrificed his life to satisfy justice and provide mercy for us. People are not built to sin. We are built to have moral freedom - the freedom to choose between good and evil. God cannot ""fix"" free will. He can remove free will - make it so that we cannot choose between good and evil - or He can deal with the results of poorly used free will. However, it is logically impossible for us to be both ""free"" and ""not free"" at the same time. Either we have moral freedom, which comes with the risk of doing evil, or we do not. Finally, I would like to point out that the Bible repeatedly says that Jesus is a sacrifice for our sins. Hebrews 7:27: Unlike the other high priests, he (Jesus) does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. Hebrews 9:26: But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. Matthew 20:28: The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.

"One widely accepted scenario for Abiogenesis is the gradual formation of life from simple chemicals leading to proteins (metabolism first) or RNA, self-replicating polymers (often assumed to be RNA) and simple cells called protocells leading to complex cells with a metabolism where evolution is in full swing. It is the only credible scientific theory for life origins It is defined simply as, "" the supposed spontaneous origination of living organisms directly from lifeless matter [1]."" Note the definition is very broad and encompasses any credible natural/scientific explanation and there are many models for the formation of life [8]. The only other alternative is Intelligent Design, which has no explanatory power. It offers no mechanism, proofs, predictive power, falsifiability or new information. It is not an explanation. RNA world model, the gradual formation of complex life in stages: 1) The basic building blocks of proteins form naturally Miller-Urey experiment famously demonstrated that 20 amino acids (out of 22) can spontaneously form [3]. This is important since these are the building blocks of complex proteins that, along with RNA/DNA form cell structures. Scientists have now worked with a variety of environments to produce amino acids and we know that at least 15 have been found in crashed meteorites, some with only a left handed chirality as seen in proteins [5]. 2) Early cell core structures, RNA/DNA, and nucleotide formation Scientists have now proven chemical pathways that form two of the four nucleotides that are the building blocks of RNA and also to form shorter RNA strands naturally. These were likely the core structure in the first cells [6]. RNA along with protein hybrids can form proteins from amino acids, catalyze important reactions in cells along with DNA formation and perform many other tasks important for life [7]. Recent studies have shown promise that DNA may even have formed first [9]. 3) Self-replicating polymers, usually assumed to be RNA, 'evolve' In a large pool of random RNA self-replicating versions can arise and leading to potential 'evolution' as mutations made in self-replication lead to changes and respond to selection pressures improving efficiency [3]. The most efficient self-replicators winning the race and mutations leading to new polymerases and ligases that can assist in forming RNA/DNA and proteins. 4)Early cells (protocells) and replication Early cells were likely small RNA strands enclosed in fatty acid membranes that have been shown to form naturally and can allow nucleotides to cross the membrane [6]. Experiments have shown that nucleotides naturally bond to single RNA strands by base pairing in colder environments eventually forming the twisted double helix we are all familiar with. In hotter environments, such as thermal vents, the strands can separate.

  One widely accepted scenario for Abiogenesis is the gradual formation of life from simple chemicals leading to proteins (metabolism first) or RNA, self-replicating polymers (often assumed to be RNA) and simple cells called protocells leading to complex cells with a metabolism where evolution is in full swing.  
     
  It is the only credible scientific theory for life origins  
  It is defined simply as,   “  the supposed spontaneous origination of living organisms directly from lifeless matter [1].”  
  Note the definition is very broad and encompasses any credible natural/scientific explanation and there are many models for the formation of life [8]. The only other alternative is Intelligent Design, which has no explanatory power. It offers no mechanism, proofs, predictive power, falsifiability or new information. It is not an explanation.  
  
  RNA world model, the gradual formation of complex life in stages:  
  1) The basic building blocks of proteins form naturally  
  Miller–Urey experiment famously demonstrated that 20 amino acids (out of 22) can spontaneously form [3]. This is important since these are the building blocks of complex proteins that, along with RNA/DNA form cell structures. Scientists have now worked with a variety of environments to produce amino acids and we know that at least 15 have been found in crashed meteorites, some with only a left handed chirality as seen in proteins [5].  
  
  2) Early cell core structures, RNA/DNA, and nucleotide formation  
  Scientists have now proven chemical pathways that form two of the four nucleotides that are the building blocks of RNA and also to form shorter RNA strands naturally.  These were likely the core structure in the first cells [6]. RNA along with protein hybrids can form proteins from amino acids, catalyze important reactions in cells along with DNA formation and perform many other tasks important for life [7]. Recent studies have shown promise that DNA may even have formed first [9].  
  
  3) Self-replicating polymers, usually assumed to be RNA, ‘evolve’  
  In a large pool of random RNA self-replicating versions can arise and leading to potential ‘evolution’ as mutations made in self-replication lead to changes and respond to selection pressures improving efficiency [3]. The most efficient self-replicators winning the race and mutations leading to new polymerases and ligases that can assist in forming RNA/DNA and proteins.  
  
  4)Early cells (protocells) and replication  
  Early cells were likely small RNA strands enclosed in fatty acid membranes that have been shown to form naturally and can allow nucleotides to cross the membrane [6]. Experiments have shown that nucleotides naturally bond to single RNA strands by base pairing in colder environments eventually forming the twisted double helix we are all familiar with.  
  In hotter environments, such as thermal vents, the strands can separate. Natural circulation cools the environment where natural base pairing would then create a replicated RNA strand and this is a potential early path for RNA replication leading again to a process of natural selection. Experiments have shown that primitive vesicle membranes can both grow and divide potentially to protocell replication.  
  
  5) Increasing complexity of cells and the development of a metabolism  
  As RNA strands replicate they inevitably mutate and change. These could have formed before cells and have been shown to improve replication in successive generations and can form ribosomes which are folded RNA molecules that can take on such tasks catalyzing RNA reproduction, synthesizing nutrients and strengthening membrane walls.  
  At this point Evolution takes over and primitive cells would respond to selection pressures. Out of the polymers that can form many, called ligases and   polymerases  , can also catalyze DNA, RNA and protein formation, which are the basic building blocks of life[4]. In a 220 nucleotide RNA strand there are 2.5x 10^112   efficient ligases     and that’s just those     we are aware of  .  
  
        -     I barely scratched the surface with our 5,000 character limit but I have been able to show that there is evidence and many plausible scenarios for the earliest cells to form. This is the explanation that the best method for identifying truth, the scientific method, has produced. It is the only credible explanation for life. God did it is not an explanation.

"First off, I never EVER said that Mike Huckabee was a democrat. All I said was that he was a good social conservative, but fiscally he isn't. That does not translate to Democrat at all.

"Although there are many arguments which call themselves ""the argument from evil,"" and debate rages as to which is most compelling, in this debate I will present and defend the following argument which comes from William Rowe[1]. Let us first define a couple of situations: (E1) Lightning strikes a tree in a forest, causing a forest fire. A fawn is caught in this fire, and suffers intense agony for an extended period of time before finally dying. (This has undoubtedly happened many times in the Earth's history.) (E2) A five year old girl is, by her mother's boyfriend, severely beaten, raped and strangled to death. (This is drawn from an incident in Flint, Michigan in 1986, but something like it has certainly happened quite a number of times.) The argument: (P) No good state of affairs that we know of is such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2. Therefore, probably: (Q) No good state of affairs is such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2. Therefore, probably: (R) God does not exist. The inference from Q to R should be self-evident: if Q is true and God exists, God would not have permitted E1 and E2. But they did happen. I am not aware of any serious challenges to this inference. So there are two parts to defending the argument from evil: showing that P is true, and showing that the inference from P to Q is valid. P is justified by the fact that every state of affairs we know about which are such that God, by bringing it about, is morally justified in permitting E1 and E2, upon reflection, either are obtainable by God without his having to permit both E1 and E2, and/or in obtaining would not morally justify God's permitting both E1 and E2[2]. To justify the inference from P to Q, we appeal to the principle of induction. Making epistemic leaps from the known to the unknown is something that humans do every day, and is regarded as not only justified, but standard. For instance, we see no thousand foot tall human beings; therefore, we are justified in concluding that no thousand foot tall humans exist. The strength of that justification depends on the exhaustiveness of the search. In the case of thousand foot humans, we have today seven billion normal sized humans who would no doubt speak up if they saw one, as well as various types of monitoring technology operating in and around the populated areas of the world. If a thousand foot human existed, we would probably know it. In the case of Christianity, we have a history of two thousand years of scholars and theologians, having collectively spilled billions if not trillions of words of ink on the subject, trying to come up with a successful theodicy. If one existed, we would probably know it. This basic principle is used by humans all the time. To argue against it is, in Rowe's words, ""simply to encourage radical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general.""[3] This holds for everything we observe in the natural realm, and since the existence of God would have observable consequences in this realm, there's no reason why it should not hold for that as well. I contend, therefore, that the argument from evil is sound and establishes that God probably does not exist.

"I accept this challenge. Before we begin, I would like to clarify that this debate can be taken in a variety of ways: Morality, Health, and Ideology. Some people believe abortion is immoral, others do not. Yet there is the fundamental argument that cannot be ignored that I will be taking in this debate. To begin, I would like to present to you the two ideas that I will be covering in this debate: 1: Abortion is required to insure the health of the patient 2: Abortion can be beneficial to society To further expand on why abortion is required to insure the health of the patient, I would like to turn to some important statistics. When abortion is performed legally, meaning by a professional, the chance of death is less than 1 in every 100,000 women. (Source: <URL>... ) Comparing this to the amount of women that die from illegal abortions is astounding, as around 68,000 women die of abortion annually . (Source: <URL>... ) Pulling statistics from Guttmacher Institute, around 1.06 million abortions were performed in 2011.

I do not know whether my opponent believes overpopulation to be a myth, or doesn't know about overpopulation at all, so I will be briefly explaining it. Overpopulation is the phenomena that the world can only sustain a certain amount of people. This may not be a problem of space, but a problem of resources. Right now, there are 7.4 billion people living on Earth. (Source: <URL>... ) According to Everything Connects, overpopulation is a big issue.

"Thank you for your closing arguments. I will respond to each one before reiterating my original arguments. 1. Your point was already addressed in my argument. Parents have exclusive rights over decisions of this sort for their children. If they disapprove, turnout will be low, and so to impose such a programme in primary school is a waste of taxpayer's money. There is no ""denying"" it to people, they always have the option of sending their children to a school to learn religion, or Sunday school, or to a madrasah on the weekends, etc. I would also like to remind you of my previous arguments, that religion is a complex and multi-faceted concept, and that unnecessary pressures would be placed on children as they make their choice. Furthermore, they are unlikely to grasp the concepts properly. For this reason, it would be more productive to have an optional, similar programme, in a secondary school, where children are more mature, and can approach the concepts better. 2. I argue that religion is indeed much less important practical knowledge than English and Mathematics. Very few people can grow up to become productive members of society, get a decent job, earn a living, etc. without at the very minimum, a primary school-level command of Mathematics and English. Both are essential skills for survival in our world. Religion, however, is not. It is unnecessary for our survival. I would like to introduce you to renowned psychologist Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. ( <URL>... ) He posits that physical needs, safety needs, social needs and esteem needs are four needs that every human being has and must be fulfilled in that order for a human being to have a happy life. Mathematics and English contribute to achieving these needs. The final level of needs is self-actualisation needs. Religion contributes to this. Notice, however, that it is only necessary after the other needs have been fulfilled. Therefore, I say that Mathematics and English are far more important, in practical terms, than religion, as an academic subject. 3. We may not tell a child about the barracuda until he/she turns 14, but that does not mean that he/she will disbelieve in the barracuda when he/she is finally told about it. We cannot possibly tell a child every single thing in the world that exists, for fear that they will disbelieve in it when they finally encounter it. In fact, I doubt that it ever happens. Children are conscious of the fact that there is much for them to learn before they understand the world. If someone had never encountered religion until the mature age of 30, however, then yes there is a definite chance that they would not believe in it, as they would be certain that they already had a knowledge of everything important in the world. The same cannot be said for a child. 4. I apologise sincerely, but I can't seem to follow your argument. I will address only the point where ""parents are one-sided"". Parents have an absolute right to be one-sided. As mentioned in previous arguments, they have almost exclusive jurisdiction over what they perceive to be in the child's best interests. I would like to remind you, once again, that religion as a subject is not the same as teaching children about religion. Religion involves an in-depth understanding of scripture. I worry that our definition of the subject has gone awry as we went down this debate. I am confident, now, that you have been able to see things from my perspective. Allow me to reiterate my arguments. Religion should not be taught in primary schools because it cannot be done without angering stakeholders. At the same time, scriptures are not mutually compatible and hence are not simple historical sources, they are contradictory, their factuality is contentious, and these shortcomings of religion an academic study cannot be passed on to children in primary school, who are not critically aware enough to make important distinctions. Teachers also have their own religious biases and inclinations, and this is very likely to manifest in the child, whom would require a great deal of fortitude to disagree with the teacher on a subject he/she knows practically nothing about. Finally, religion as a subject is unnecessary as a mechanism to impart good values in primary school. As I have mentioned previously, many religious institutions do this by imparting a fear of divine retribution to their students. Furthermore, morally contradictory events in scripture, such as the Biblical story of Abraham almost sacrificing his son to God, are both confusing and to many, immoral in content. This uncertainty we hold in our scripture must not be arbitrarily passed down to every child in primary school. Values can be imparted as they are, because they are intrinsic to our cultures and society. Values such as respecting your elders are more common in Asian societies, but even though they are Biblical concepts, far less of Asia is Christian than the Western world. Values can be imparted as part of teaching civic mindedness, as well. Objective case studies must be given to primary school students to put them on the path of critical awareness, so that they are able to tackle difficult concepts in their future. We must first place students on the path to understanding objective knowledge, before plunging them into the depths of uncertainty that is religion. For these reasons, I reiterate that religion should absolutely not be taught in primary schools. This has been a most fruitful debate, I thank you, AimeeGleek17, for your spirited arguments.

"Well, thanks for accepting my challenge, theLwerd. As usual, my opponent has put forward some very impressive-sounding arguments and expressed them in an extremely convincing manner. Therefore, on this occasion (and this occasion only) I would ask the members to vote on the issues, rather than the quality of the debate! You see, some very dodgy politicians have risen to power through effectively promoting preposterous policies - policies that in sober analysis would seem outrageous, but have been nonetheless been implemented because the electorate have been convinced by that politician's rhetoric and force of argument. Margaret Thatcher was a frothing nutjob who decimated British manufacturing and heavy industries, but I met her and also watched her make speeches when she was at the height of power and she was, undeniably, a formidable and impressive character. I believe that theLwerd possesses similar powers of persuasion (albeit she is not quite as evil or mad as Thatcher!) Now I've got that off my chest, I would like to address my opponent's points. Her first and second points addressed, in short, sexual discrimination, claiming, in the legal sense, that is usually confined to the workplace and that a private establishment may limit admission to women, to protect them, rather than to discriminate against men. Perhaps in the US, anti-discrimination legislation is confined to the workplace. Here in the UK, however, golf clubs and gentlemen's clubs (in the traditional sense, rather than in the sense of a lap-dancing club) and working-men's clubs, had strict male-only membership policies. Now they are obliged by law to admit women. However, this may be a legal requirement, but I would contend that it is also a moral one, and that same moral principle should apply in the US, whether or not it is legally enforceable. In the case of a club that refuses admission to all men, based solely on their gender, disregarding their general demeanour, must be considered blatant discrimination. I agree that a pack of drunken yobs hoping to see some live, red hot, XXX girl-on-girl action, free of charge, and subsequently bundle inside the club shouting things like ""come on girls, lez it for the lads"" might be intimidating to the customers and so should be refused admission. However, my friends and I were (reasonably) sober and (ostensibly) respectable and would have posed no threat to the occupants of the lesbian bar. The management have the right to refuse admission, of course, but it must be justified. Clearly a pub that had a sign up outside saying: ""All welcome (except foreigners)"" would have a tough job defending this admission policy, morally, even if not legally. My opponent was correct in her assumption that I did not try and pass myself off as either a gay man or a lesbian. My impressions of a gay man are, at best comical, at worst offensive , but either way, utterly unconvincing. I toyed with my opponent's idea of buying a dress and a wig together with some false breasts from the joke shop and disguising myself as a woman in order to gain illicit entry into the Candy Club. However, I am six feet four inches tall with a stubbly chin and I suspect my ploy would be soon exposed! My opponent's third point implied that the presence of males may discourage some women from attending lesbian bars and that, as a result, the bars may lose money. I dispute this point most strongly. I spend a King's ransom on booze and so do all my mates, whereas women tend to just sip coffee or Pimms and lemonade and can make a couple of drinks last all night. And, anyway, if they want to go to an all-female / gay male environment, there's always Starbucks! I believe that, in a modern, liberal-minded society, women can only progress on the basis of having a truly equal playing field with no special privileges accorded to either gender.",0,brian_eggleston,"

"How do you figure that they will be a ""Disruption""? People are not going to get very far in life without an education, sorry but it's just not going to happen. How are kids supposed to get jobs? Would you rather your child work at a fast food restaurant the rest of their lives? That's not what I want for my child. All kids would be doing is running the streets, making the rate of teen alcoholics and the rate of teens doing drugs increase highly. And plus, not only would no students attend school, but it would also run schools out of business because no one is choosing to attend. Children need an education to succeed in life. I don't know how anyone couldn't see that.",0,caubrie123,"

"First of all, I stated that Russia is heading back into a communist state. As a Polish citizen I should know that. Second of all, that is why I said To move the US armies to a smaller powerful Country, and change the uniforms to theirs. As for the death toll, Humanity might die if we don't invade, so what does it mater the lives of three billion people or all of humanity? Also did you see those numbers of warheads Russia is in control of? I have to admit Putin is kind of crazy, and with those weapons he can get the world, or at least he thinks he can.",0,rafalaf,"
