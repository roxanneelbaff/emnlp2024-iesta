{'basic': '\nArgument 2: People should take responsibility for their own healthcare decisions rather than relying on the government to make choices for them. First, individuals will naturally be more invested in their own care if they must bear the burden of the decision-making process. Second, personalized medical advice from professionals can help guide patients towards the best possible treatments. Third, allowing individuals to take charge of their own healthcare decisions increases autonomy and trust between patient and doctor. Finally, decentralizing healthcare decision-making allows for greater innovation within the healthcare industry, creating new opportunities for treatment options and technologies. Ultimately, empowering individuals to take control of their healthcare decisions leads to better overall health outcomes.', 'len_basic': 828, 'len_orig': 1918, 'ideology': '\nArgument 2 (Con): People rely on the welfare state too much and take advantage of it; it needs to stay in order to provide safety nets for those truly in need. First off, many people depend heavily upon the welfare state and would struggle without it. For instance, there are millions of disabled individuals who require assistance from the government in order to survive. Furthermore, low-income families rely on subsidies and programs provided by the government in order to make ends meet. Additionally, the welfare state provides essential social protection, such as unemployment benefits, sickness benefits, maternity leave, etc., which are necessary for citizens to live dignified lives. Finally, the welfare state helps reduce inequality significantly, as it ensures that everyone gets the same opportunities regardless of their economic status. Therefore, it is clear that the welfare state serves an important purpose and must remain in place in order to protect those who genuinely need help.', 'len_ideology': 1002, 'content': '\nArgument 2: People should take responsibility for their own healthcare decisions rather than relying on the government to make choices for them.  \nFirstly, individuals should have autonomy over their bodies and the right to decide what treatments they want and don’t want.

Firstly, the Welfare State provides vital social protection for individuals and families facing economic hardship, poverty and vulnerabilities. By providing access to basic necessities such as healthcare, housing and education, it ensures that no one is left behind and that everyone can live with dignity. Secondly, the Welfare State helps to reduce inequality between different groups within societies, allowing those who are more privileged to help those who are less fortunate. Finally, the Welfare State serves an important function in helping to create cohesive and equitable societies where everyone feels safe and secure. Therefore, any changes to the current model must ensure that these objectives are maintained while recognizing the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness.', 'len_ideology-content': 934, 'ideology-style': "\nArgument: I believe the Welfare state, the government rule giving benefits to those in need of support through benefit payments and services, is outdated and in need of a replacement. \nFirst of all the welfare state is about merit goods - goods that give significant benefits to the individual consuming them and to society as a whole. However people undervalue these and what I mean by that is that if these goods/services cost they wouldn't be bought by everybody. \nA few examples come to mind for example, education. It is free but some people wouldn't buy it if it did cost. So, the costs to the government or the nation as a whole. \nThe welfare state costs an awful lot of money to the government, peoples hard earned income is being distributed to some people who claim to have a disability or in desperate need of income but in actual fact are taking advantage of this badly formed concept and claiming benefits they don't need.  \nAlso I believe some people may be overlooked by the government when they do meet the criteria to gain these benefits because the background search of some people is not thorough enough. This has become a problem as a lot of people have discovered this ‘loophole’ and are taking advantage of it. \nThe alternatives to the welfare state include increasing the role of the voluntary sector. This means making people responsible for other people and caring for each other as a community. This may not seem like it would work but I believe a system could be put in place so everyone has to contribute to the community. \nI also believe some adjustments could be made to the welfare state such as making it universal although this does have its drawbacks. \nIn conclusion I think everyone should play a bigger role in shaping our community and caring for the elderly and the unable instead of just giving them a bit of money in which the government expect them to know what to use it for.", 'len_ideology-style': 1918, 'all': '\nArgument: I believe the Welfare state, the government rule giving benefits to those in need of support through benefit payments and services, is outdated and in need of a replacement. \nFirst of all, the welfare state is about merit goods –– goods that give significant benefits to the individual consuming them and to society as a whole.

Additionally, some people may go unnoticed by the government when they do fulfill the criteria to receive these benefits due to the insufficient background checks performed. This has become a major issue as many people have found this “loophole” and are exploiting it. \nAlternatives to the welfare state include increasing the involvement of the volunteer sector. This entails having people take responsibility for one another and forming communities. Although this approach may not initially appear successful, I believe a system could be implemented whereby every person contributes to the collective good and looks after each other as neighbors. Moreover, certain modifications could be made to the welfare state, such as making it universal, albeit with potential downfalls. Ultimately, I believe that everyone should take on a larger role in shaping our societies and caring for the elderly and disabled rather than simply handing out monetary aid that the government expects to be used wisely.', 'len_all': 2001}
