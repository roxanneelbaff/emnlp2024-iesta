The majority people who don't want to vote will vote to get it over with and not put any thought into it, giving the candidate an unfair advantage or disadvantage based really on luck, with no actual thought going into the vote. More candidates will be elected due to luck rather than what the general public really wants. Thanks, looking forward to a good argument!\"}, {'effective_argument': 'My opponent quotes: \"Okay, I am conceding defeat.\" My opponent has given up the debate and has accepted defeat. I heavily urge a Con vote. Thank you.'}, {'effective_argument': \"1 - In the example of ALFA corporation, Pro assumes that it would be beneficial for the corporation to utilize the other 75 acres of land. To use those acres, ALFA would have to incur expenses such as planting, watering, pesticides, consulting, harvesting, processing, and distribution of final product. These expenses are only offset, resulting in profit, if there is sufficient demand for the product. If there isn't enough demand, ALFA will incur a loss by using those extra acres. Why then is ALFA corporation only using 25 acres? I can only think of two reasons: There isn't enough demand to justify planting more crops, or ALFA corporation doesn't have the capital to carry the expenses through harvest. In the first case, taxing ALFA corporation won't do any good, in fact the tax would hurt a corporation that is already running below capacity due to poor economic conditions. In the second case, taxing ALFA corporation would only contribute to their capital problems, making future expansion more difficult. 2 - In the example of the two apartment complexes, there is obviously a reason for the second complex to have been built. Demand drives an economy, and the current demand trends in housing call for larger, open floor plans, modern appliances, modern fixtures, higher ceilings, and other such modern attributes to homes. Many people will choose to pay more to live in a newer, larger, modern apartment than a cheaper, older apartment. This demand is what causes new complexes to be built when others are still vacant. The only way to change the natural supply/demand process of the free market would be to take away the freedom and force people to move into existing complexes. Taxing the empty apartments would only hurt those who are trying to turn a profit in an area of housing where there is less demand. It would do nothing to incentivize people to consider housing that they don't desire. 3 - Pro states that increasing taxes on unused land and apartments would somehow stimulate the economy, without giving any reasons as to how such taxes would increase demand. Without demand, there can be no profit. I assert that unused apartments, homes, and land should not be taxed, because doing so only adds additional financial burden in an economy with low demand and struggling balance sheets.\"}]\n"
