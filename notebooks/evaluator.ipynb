       "'\"There\\'s no question that weapons in the hands of the public have prevented acts of terror or stopped them\" stated Inspector-General Shlomo Aharonisk in regards to Israel\\'s gun control policy. And who cannot look at the facts and assume a similar position on the subject of gun control? Why would any society with an adequately supplied army and constabulary ever notion that disarming the people would not lead to the lessening of power of non-governmental forces? In countries like British North America or British India Gandhi and Jefferson shunned the idea of depriving their citizens of firearms, but you must come to realise that these were the very sorts of people who wanted to cause political destability, which was certainly the moral high ground in Gandhi\\'s time, but considering that the United States is democratic, stable, and has the principles of liberty ingrained deep in tradition and law, should this historical solution originally designed by rebels and criminals (Founding Fathers) be reconsidered? I am by no means suggesting that the wide circulation of firearms is going become an asset in mass political destablizartion and revolution (though it has happened in American history, most notably 1960). You state that guns are needed to preserve the liberty of the people, but one must also conclude from history that it hasn\\'t even helped father the cause of liberty, for it proved inadequate in the various slave rebellions that lit up America. Yet the sad fact remains that gun-related violent crime at the hands of mobsters and street gangs is rampant in many major American cities. Critics point out that gun control doesn\\'t work and point to examples like Glasgow where knife-crime is rampant. Yet the liberal production of assault rifles, handguns, and other hobby guns seethes across the United States, and cities like New York that have issued restriction polices have only yielded benefits, such as a slight decline in violent. The problem created in United States even travels north across the border where Canadian officials are powerless to stop the flow of legally produced armanments that often find their way into the hands of Torontonian or Vancouverite gangs and tarnishes American image as a people of hapless rednecks that can\\'t even control military supplies. Again in your rebuttal you visit another moot issue that you believe to be truth merely because it was written in a several hundred-year old document, \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state...\" is no longer valid because the United States has evolved past its stage as wayside colony scared of being gobbled up its former mistress or raided from the West by Aboriginal raids. Now she is a nation among nations, a superpower more committed to the cause of democracy than most others, stable, and protected by a regular army (not had in Jefferson\\'s day) and elite constabulary that makes criminals both home and abroad scared to attain America\\'s wrath, but on occasion using one the very constitutional principles of arms-bearing to blacken the efforts of American law enforcement.'"
